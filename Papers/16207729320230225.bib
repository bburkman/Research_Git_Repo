Abstract = {Increasing antimicrobial resistance in uropathogens is a clinical challenge to emergency physicians as antibiotics should be selected before an infecting pathogen or its antibiotic resistance profile is confirmed. We created a predictive model for antibiotic resistance of uropathogens, using machine learning (ML) algorithms. This single-center retrospective study evaluated patients diagnosed with urinary tract infection (UTI) in the emergency department (ED) between January 2020 and June 2021. Thirty-nine variables were used to train the model to predict resistance to ciprofloxacin and the presence of urinary pathogens' extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. The model was built with Gradient-Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT) with performance evaluation. Also, we visualized feature importance using SHapely Additive exPlanations. After two-step customization of threshold adjustment and feature selection, the final model was compared with that of the original prescribers in the emergency departme},
