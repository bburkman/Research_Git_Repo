New Google Pixel phones can automatically notify an emergency dispatcher if the phone detects the deceleration profile of a vehicular crash.  Most crash notifications come from an eyewitness who can say whether an ambulance is needed, but the automated notification from the cell phone cannot provide that information directly.  Should the dispatcher immediately send an ambulance before receiving an eyewitness report?  There are three options: Always, Wait, and Sometimes.  The ``Always'' option refers to sending an ambulance to every automatically reported crash, even though most of them will not be needed.  In the ``Wait'' option, the dispatcher sends police, but always waits for a call from an eyewitness (perhaps the police) before sending an ambulance.  In the ``Sometimes'' option, the dispatcher relies on a machine learning recommendation system to decide whether to immediately dispatch an ambulance, reserving the option to send one later based on an eyewitness report.

%This paper explores one option for building a machine learning (ML) model for making a recommendation in the ``Sometimes'' option.  The model gives the probability (based on the available information) that a crash requires an ambulance.  If the probability that an ambulance is needed is above some chosen threshold, the method will recommend dispatching an ambulance immediately; below that threshold, the dispatcher should wait to hear from an eyewitness.


This paper explores one option for building a machine learning (ML) model for making a recommendation in the ``Sometimes'' option.    Our goal is to build a model that returns, for each feature vector (crash report, sample), a probability $p$ that the person needs an ambulance.  Then we choose a threshold $\theta$ such that we immediately send ambulances to those automated crash reports with $p > \theta$, and wait for eyewitness confirmation for those reports with $p < \theta$. In an actual implementation, the choice of $\theta$ is political, not technical, so we consider and interpret several options.

Once a threshold has been chosen, the costs of the false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) in dispatching ambulances are very different.  The cost of sending an ambulance when one is not needed (FP) is measured in dollars, but the cost of not promptly sending an ambulance when one is needed (FN) is measured in lives.  Choosing such a tradeoff threshold is ethically problematic, but governments implicitly choose such a tradeoff when they set budgets for emergency services.

We consider and interpret several options for $\theta$, some of which consider a relationship between the total number of FP and FN up to that value of $p$, and others consider the marginal relationship around that value of $p$.  Once the threshold criteria are chosen, the problem turns to choosing and tuning a model that best satisfies the tradeoff, saving both money and lives.

%We consider the factors in determining the threshold.  The costs of the false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) in dispatching ambulances are very different.  The cost of sending an ambulance when one is not needed (FP) is measured in dollars, but the cost of not promptly sending an ambulance when one is needed (FN) is measured in lives.  Choosing such a tradeoff threshold is ethically problematic, but governments implicitly make such a tradeoff when they set budgets for emergency and medical services.  To demonstrate the method in this paper, we have arbitrarily chosen a cutoff of 33\%, that there is a 1 in 3 chance that a dispatched ambulance would be needed (TP) and a 2 in 3 chance that it would not (FP).  We formulate our marginal ethical tradeoff rate as   $\omega = \Delta FP/\Delta TP = 2.0$.  We incorporated $\omega$ into the model in the class weight and in the decision threshold.

We show that the quality of the model depends highly on the input data available, and we considered three levels of data availability.  The ``Easy'' level includes time of day and weather, data the emergency dispatcher has before the notification.  The ``Medium'' level adds the age and sex of the cell phone user and information about the location.  The ``Hard'' level adds information about the vehicle likely to be driven by the cell phone user and detailed and temporal information about the location, like lighting conditions and whether it is currently a work zone.

We used the data of the Crash Report Sampling System (CRSS) to validate our approach.  We have applied new methods (for this dataset in the literature) to handle missing data, and we have investigated several methods for handling the data imbalance.  To promote discussion and future research, we have included all of the code we used in our analysis.
