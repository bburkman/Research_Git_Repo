Novel Aspects of this Work

\begin{itemize}
	\item New Real-World Problem:  Newly emerging problem of what to do with greatly increased volume of automated crash notification data.
	\item New Dataset:  This particular dataset (Louisiana crash reports) has not been used in this way before.
	\item New Combinations of Methods:  The data is very incomplete, dirty, and imbalanced.  Off-the-shelf methods will not give the level of confidence needed for life-and-death decisions.  
\end{itemize}
