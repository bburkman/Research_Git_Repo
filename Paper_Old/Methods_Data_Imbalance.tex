\subsection{Handling Data Imbalance and Building Models}

In the Literature Review section we enumerated many methods for dealing with data imbalance, most of which are relevant to our problem.  In the code \verb|CRSS_06_Build_Model_01_15_22.ipynb| we implemented these methods.  We tried all of them, individually and in combinations, to see which combinations of methods give the most effective model.  

\begin{itemize}
	\item Ensure that the training and test sets have the same proportion of positive and negative class samples
	\item Tomek Links, both once and twice
	\item Balanced Metrics
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Balanced Accuracy
		\item Balanced F1
		\item Balanced Precision
	\end{itemize}
	\item Loss Functions
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\alpha$-weighted Binary Crossentropy
		\item Focal Loss
	\end{itemize}
	\item Model Algorithms
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Keras Simple Neural Network
		\item AdaBoost Classifier
		\item Balanced Bagging Classifier
		\item Balanced Random Forest Classifier
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
