\subsection{Feature Selection}

In selecting features from the CRSS dataset, we chose features that could be known or inferred at the time of the crash without an eyewitness.  We separated them into three sets in terms of how hard the data would be to get in good quality:  Easy, medium, and hard.  The easy information is a baseline, the information the police have before they receive the notification, like locality, time of day, and weather.    The medium level requires detailed maps to distinguish between, for example, an intersection and a parking lot, and information from the phone service provider about the primary user of the phone.  The hard level would require coordination of private (cell service providers, Apple Google) and public databases (police, government vehicle registries), or correlating several notifications from different phones at about the same time from about the same location to see that they are probably the same crash event.
