\subsection{Model Building}

To build our model, we chose the Keras/Tensorflow \citep{chollet2015keras} library over scikit-learn \citep{scikit-learn} because of the ease of writing a custom loss function, although we did use the sklearn library for many data preparation functions.  

Since our focus is on levels of data availability and handling data imbalance, we did not build a sophisticated model.  We adapted the model from the Tensorflow tutorial on imbalanced data, which uses credit card fraud detection as its application, but works very similarly. \citep{Tensorflow_Imbalanced_Data}
