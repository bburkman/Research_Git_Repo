\section{Derived Data}

Many of the features in the big data files (Accident, Vehicle, Person) are derived from other information, either as a count or as a summary.  

URBANICITY does not actually tell us whether the crash occurred in town or out; it just tells us whether the PSU county had a population of 250,000 or more.  Most counties have both urban and rural areas, so the distinction may not be as useful as one would think.
