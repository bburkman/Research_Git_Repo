note = {Two questions arise: where does the sigmoid train set comefrom? and how to avoid overfitting to this training set?
If we use the same data set that was used to train the modelwe want to calibrate, we introduce unwanted bias. For example,if the model learns to discriminate the train set perfectlyand orders all the negative examples before the positiveexamples, then the sigmoid transformation will outputjust a 0,1 function. So we need to use an independent calibrationset in order to get good posterior probabilities. This,however, is not a draw back, since the same set can be usedfor model and parameter selection.To avoid overfitting to the sigmoid train set, an out-ofsamplemodel is used.
