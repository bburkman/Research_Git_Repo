abstract = {Objective: To estimate the reduction in traffic mortality in the United States that would result from an automatic crash notification (ACN) system. Methods: 1997 Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) data from 30875 cases of incapacitating or fatal injury with complete information on emergency medical services (EMS) notification and arrival times were analyzed considering cases at any time to be in one of four states: (1) alive prior to notification; (2) alive after notification; (3) alive after EMS arrival; and (4) dead. For each minute after the crash, transition probabilities were calculated for each possible change of state. These data were used to construct models with (1) number of incapacitating injuries ranging from FARS cases up to an estimated total for the US in 1997; (2) deaths equal to FARS total; (3) transitions to death from other states proportional to FARS totals and rates and (4) other state transitions equal to FARS rates. The outcomes from these models were compared to outcomes from otherwise identical models in which all notification times were set to 1 min. Results: FARS data estimated 12 823 deaths prior to notification, 1800 after notification, and 14 015 between EMS arrival and 6 h. If notification times were all set to 1 min, a model using FARS data only predicted 10 703 deaths prior to notification, 2306 after notification, and 15 208 after EMS arrival, while a model using an estimated total number of incapacitating injuries for the US predicted 9569 deaths prior to notification, 2261 after notification, and 15 134 after arrival. In the first model, overall mortality was reduced from 28 638 to 28 217 (421 per year, or 1.5%), while in the second model mortality was reduced to 26964 (1674 per year, or 6%). Conclusions: Modest but important reduction in traffic mortality should be expected from a fully functional ACN system. Imperfect systems would be less effective.}

abstract = {The use of an automated collision notification (ACN) device in vehicles can greatly reduce the time between crash occurrence and notification of emergency medical services (EMSs). Most ACN devices rely on cellular technology to report important crash information to the proper authorities. The objective of this study was to examine the ability of the existing western New York cellular analog system to support ACN systems. The first task was to develop a model predicting the probability of successfully completing an emergency ACN call at attenuated levels of received signal strength indicator (RSSI), a measurement of the bond between cell phone and tower. Then, empirical estimates were made of the time necessary for call completion at given levels of the RSSI. The RSSI is sampled at locations throughout Erie County, New York, and this information is used to determine the probability of successful call completion for different locations within the county. This model was then applied to historic data for selected past crashes. Finally, the findings were compared with real-world crash data obtained from the ACN Field Operational Test program, where 750 ACN devices were installed in cars and their performance examined over time. An interpolated map of the sampled RSSI values suggests that cellular coverage in Erie County is adequate to support the automated collision network technology. The models and techniques described here are applicable to other areas and regions of the country.}

Improving notification times and the ability to predict which crashes will involve severe injuries may improve trauma system utilization. This study was undertaken to develop and validate a model to predict severe head injury following MVC using information readily incorporated into an automatic crash notification system. A cross-sectional study with derivation and validation sets was performed. The cohort was drawn from drivers of vehicles involved in MVC obtained from the National Automotive Sampling System (NASS). Independent multivariable predictors of severe head injury were identified. The model was able to stratify drivers according to their risk of severe head injury indicating its validity. The areas under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were 0.7928 in the derivation set and 0.7940 in the validation set. We have developed a prediction model for head injury in MVC. As the development of automatic crash notification systems improves, models such as this one will be necessary to permit triage of what would be an overwhelming increase in crash notifications to pre-hospital responders.}

abstract = {Background
Occult injuries are not easily detected and can be potentially life-threatening. The purpose of this study was to quantify the perceived occultness of the most frequent motor vehicle crash injuries according to emergency medical services (EMS) professionals.
Study design
An electronic survey was distributed to 1,125 EMS professionals who were asked to quantify the likelihood that first responders would miss symptoms related to a particular injury on a 5-point Likert scale. The Occult Score for each injury was computed from the average of all the survey responses and normalized to be a continuous metric ranging from 0 to 1 where 0 is a non-occult (highly apparent on initial presentation) injury and 1 is an occult (unapparent on initial presentation) injury.
Results
Overall, 110,671 survey responses were collected. The Occult Score ranged from 0 to 1 with a mean, median, and standard deviation of 0.443, 0.450, and 0.233, respectively. When comparing the Occult Score of an injury to its corresponding AIS severity, there was no relationship between the metrics. When stratifying by body region, injury type, and AIS severity, it was evident that AIS 2–4 abdominal injuries with lacerations, hemorrhage, or contusions were perceived as the most occult injuries.
Conclusions
Timely triage is key to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with occult injuries. The Occult Score developed in this study to describe the predictability of an injury in a motor vehicle crash will be used as part of a larger effort, including incorporation into an advanced automatic crash notification (AACN) algorithm to detect crash conditions associated with a patient’s need for prompt treatment at a trauma center.}

abstract = {The Active Traffic Management (ATM) system has been widely used in the United States and the European countries to improve the traffic safety of urban expressways. The accurate real-time crash risk prediction is fundamental to the system running well. Crash data are characterized by small probability, which poses a typical Imbalanced Data Classification problem. Most previous studies mainly improved the prediction methods only in data level or algorithm level, which may be inadequate to predict the crash risk accurately especially in a continuous real-time traffic data environment. The comprehensive imbalanced classification algorithm was examined in this research to build more accurate real-time traffic crash risk prediction model. At the output level, the Youden index method has been proved to be of the best ability to divide the prediction results and Probability Calibration Method was proposed to optimize the prediction results in further. At the data level, Under-sampling and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique(SMOTE) methods were compared to solve the imbalanced data classification problem by changing the data distribution. At the algorithm level, the cost-sensitive MLP algorithm and Adaboost algorithm were examined and finally the random sampling cost-sensitive MLP model(RCSMLP) and Rusboost model were constructed by synthesizing the optimization methods from three levels. The sensitivity of the RCSMLP model reached 78.10 % and the specificity of the model reached 81.44 %. The AUC and sensitivity of the Rusboost model reached 0.892 and 0.842 while the specificity of the model reached 0.816, which shows the better performance in dealing with the imbalanced traffic crash risk prediction problem compared to existed prediction models. The proposed method of improving prediction accuracy in this study is universal and can be applied to many other prediction models to predict real-time traffic crash risk.}

abstract = {Hit-and-run crashes not only degrade the morality, but also result in delays of medical services provided to victims. However, class imbalance problem exists as the number of hit-and-run crashes is much smaller than that of non-hit-and-run crashes. The missing label problem also exists in the crash analysis due to reasons like data barrier such that the information hidden in the unlabelled samples has not been effectively utilised. In this paper, a cost-sensitive semi-supervised logistic regression (CS3LR) model is proposed for hit-and-run analysis, in order to tackle class-imbalanced data distribution and missing label problem, based on the crash dataset of Victorian, Australia (2013–2019). By performing label estimation with logistic regression jointly utilising both labelled and unlabelled data with pseudo labels in a well-designed cost-sensitive semi-supervised maximum likelihood framework, the proposed model can obtain an unbiased likelihood parameter for hit-and-run prediction and analysis. Comparing the experimental results of CS3LR model with two logistic regression models and seven machine learning methods, better performance of CS3LR model is demonstrated. The most significant contributing factors to hit-and-run crashes extracted by CS3LR with only 10% labelled data show a high degree of consistency with the true contributing factors obtained by the supervised cost-sensitive logistic regression with complete hit-and-run labels. The effects of class-weighted ratio and hyper-parameter λ on the performance of hit-and-run crash prediction model have also been analysed. The results can further provide recommendations and implications on the policies and counter-measures for preventing hit-and-run collisions and crimes. The methodology proposed in this paper can also be employed to analyse crash data with other types of missing labels, such as crash severity.}

According to the AV collision data managed by the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), however, the safety issue of AVs has continuously been a concern. This paper aims to learn the contributing factors to AV crash severity from the latest 3-year AV collision data. To achieve the objective, we develop an AV crash severity classification tree with the possible contributing factors by the cost-sensitive classification and regression tree (CART) model, which can deal with the class imbalance issue raised from the AV collision dataset. Our results show that the main factors affecting AV crash severity level include manufacturer, facility type, movement preceding collision, collision type, light condition and year. These findings could provide useful insights for traffic engineers or AV manufacturers to raise effective counter measures or policies to mitigate AV crash severity.}

abstract = {This paper reports on a spatial model that can be used to support evaluation of the effectiveness of automated collision notification (ACN) technology. Such systems rely on wireless phones to transmit their crash messages. However, cellular coverage exhibits great variation in hilly and rural areas, and these are regions where ACN devices provide their greatest benefits. In this context, the accurate prediction of cell phone signal strength is of paramount importance and hence, an in-depth analysis of the variables influencing the cellular signal is necessary. In this paper, we first model the spatial variation of cell phone coverage using an interpolation method known as kriging. We focus on how particular factors such as slope, altitude, distance to the cell tower and topographic obstruction are used to improve the prediction of cell phone signal strength. The effect of these factors is evaluated in a multiple regression framework, followed by an analysis of the residuals, providing valuable information for cellular network providers. However, since the residuals show some spatial structure, we therefore analyze the merits of a more suitable method, namely spatial regression. We illustrate the approach using data on cell phone coverage in a hilly section of Erie county, New York. The model should (a) enhance our knowledge of the effect of particular factors on signal strength intensity, and (b) result in improved estimates of RSSI at unknown locations. The latter is important in establishing the effectiveness of automated collision notification (ACN) technology.}

The estimation of injury severity based on statistical field data, as incorporated in current AACN systems, lack specificity and accuracy to identify the risk of life-threatening conditions. To enhance the existing AACN framework, the goal of the current study was to develop a computational methodology to predict risk of injury in specific body regions based on specific characteristics of the crash, occupant and vehicle. The computational technique involved multibody models of the vehicle and the occupant to simulate the case-specific occupant dynamics and subsequently predict the injury risk using established physical metrics. To demonstrate the computational-based injury prediction methodology, three frontal crash cases involving adult drivers in passenger cars were extracted from the US National Automotive Sampling System Crashworthiness Data System. The representative vehicle model, anthropometrically scaled model of the occupant and kinematic information related to the crash cases, selected at different severities, were used for the blinded verification of injury risk estimations in five different body regions. When compared to existing statistical algorithms, the current computational methodology is a significant improvement toward post-crash injury prediction specifically tailored to individual attributes of the crash. Variations in the initial posture of the driver, analyzed as a pre-crash variable, were shown to have a significant effect on the injury risk.}

abstract = {Advanced Automated Crash Notification (AACN) algorithms use telemetric data from vehicles to notify emergency services of a collision involving the vehicle. The aim is to quickly dispatch the appropriate medical response to the crash scene. An important part of AACN systems is predicting occupant injury, which is highly dependent on the side of the vehicle that is struck in a crash. A given frontal collision has a 9% probability of serious injury. A collision with the same speed and conditions to the left side of the vehicle results in a predicted 38% probability of serious injury. One method for estimating the damage side is to use in-vehicle sensors available on current vehicles by using the Principal Direction of Force (PDOF) derived from accelerometer-based measurements. PDOF is only the direction of the crash impulse, it does not specify the damage side. For example a PDOF of 45° could as easily be a front impact as a side impact. Using PDOF as a surrogate for damage side may be appropriate in many collisions but not in others. This study examined the accuracy of PDOF estimates made from in-vehicle sensors recorded by the Event Data Recorder (EDR) and the implications of using these PDOF estimates as a surrogate for estimating damage side in real-world collisions. We found that PDOF estimates made from in-vehicle sensors were accurate compared to crash test instrumentation examined in 54 side impact tests. PDOF estimates based on the EDR sensors and crash test instrumentation were within 10° of each other and had a root mean squared difference of 4.4°. In 10% of the 146 real-world collisions examined, using PDOF computed by the EDR as a surrogate for damage side would incorrectly identify the damage side. Furthermore, the PDOF estimated by crash investigators and the EDR differed by up to 45° in crashes. These discrepancies have major implications for the accuracy of AACN systems because injury risk estimates are derived from investigator PDOF estimates. A possible solution is to use EDR data to develop future AACN injury risk predictions instead of investigator PDOF estimates.}

abstract = {Abnormal driving behavior is one of the main causes of roadway collisions. In most studies of abnormal driving behavior, the abnormal driving status is detected and analyzed using classification algorithms directly or using unsupervised learning algorithms to classify reconstruction or prediction residuals. However, abnormal driving behavior data are difficult to acquire and label. Also, a class imbalance issue is inherent in the algorithm training process due to the relatively sparse data for abnormal driving behavior. Moreover, current studies that include residual analysis tend to focus on individual points and thus fail to capture the continuity characteristic of abnormal driving behavior. To address these problems, a long short-term memory-residual (LSTM-R) algorithm is proposed to detect abnormal driving behavior in real time. The proposed algorithm (referred to simply as LSTM-R) has two steps. First, an LSTM network is used to fit the current vehicle kinematic data based on historical data to obtain the root mean square residual at each moment. Second, a time window-based residual algorithm is designed and employed to detect abnormal driving behavior according to the magnitude and continuity of the residuals. To verify the effectiveness of LSTM-R, an experimental test was conducted in Nanjing, China. The vehicle kinematic data were collected non-intrusively using a smartphone. In addition, AdaCost, SMOTEBoost, EasyEnsemble, LightGBM-residual, and linear regression-residual algorithms were employed for comparison with the proposed algorithm to assess its effectiveness. The effects of (1) the degree-of-fit of the LSTM network, (2) the LSTM-R parameters, and (3) the abnormal driving behavior percentage on the detection results were analyzed in detail. First, both the underfitting and overfitting of the LSTM network compromise the detection performance. Second, within a certain range of values, the LSTM-R parameters have little effect on the detection results. Third, the detection results are affected only slightly by the abnormal proportion. The results show that LSTM-R, with a maximum F1-score of 0.866, significantly outperforms the other five algorithms. Furthermore, even if only 10% abnormal driving behavior is in the training set, LSTM-R’s F1-score can still be close to 0.86, indicating a significant relaxation of the requirements for labeled data. Also, the required data are easy to collect, which indicates LSTM-R’s extensive application possibilities. This paper thus provides an effective method for the real-time detection of abnormal driving behavior and also supports driving risk assessment and driving behavior improvement with the overall goal to enhance roadway safety.}
