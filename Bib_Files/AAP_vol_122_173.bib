abstract = {Safety performance functions (SPFs) are crash count prediction models that are used for identifying high crash risk locations, evaluating road safety before and after countermeasure deployment and comparing the safety of alternative site designs. The traditional method of modeling crash counts is negative binomial (NB) regression. Furthermore, the Highway Safety Manual (HSM) provides analytical tools, including NB SPFs, to assess and improve road safety. Even though the HSM’s SPFs are restricted to NB models, the road safety literature is rich with a variety of different modeling techniques. Researchers have calibrated the HSM’s SPFs to local conditions using a calibration method prescribed by the HSM. However, studies in which SPFs are developed and transferred to other localities are uncommon. In this paper, we develop and transfer rural divided multilane highway segment SPFs of Florida, Ohio, Illinois, Minnesota, California, Washington and North Carolina to each state. For every state, NB, zero-inflated NB, Poisson lognormal (PLN), regression tree, random forest (RF), boosting and Tobit models are developed. A hybrid model that coalesces the predictions of both the Tobit and the NB model is proposed and developed as well. All SPFs are transferred to each state and their predictive performances are evaluated to discern which model type is the most transferable. According to the transferability results, there is no single superior model type. However, the Tobit, RF, tree, NB and hybrid models demonstrate better predictive performances than those of the other methods in a considerably large proportion of transferred SPFs.}

abstract = {This study was an investigation into mind wandering during everyday driving, and its association with crash patterns. We selected a 25 km route on urban roads for analysis of crashes, and an on-road study of mind wandering by a sample of drivers familiar with the route. We analysed reported crashes on the route over a five year period from New Zealand's crash database. For the on-road study a researcher accompanied 25 drivers on the route, asking them what they were thinking about at 15 predetermined road sections. The road sections were selected to include a range of different speed limits and traffic volumes as well as roundabouts, priority intersections and midblocks. Thought samples were categorised as either mind wandering or driving focus, and triggered by the senses, or internally. The frequencies of mind wandering at different road sections on the route were compared to the frequencies of reported crashes along the same route over the preceding five years. Results showed that although all drivers reported mind wandering, it was more likely to be reported at slower, quieter, less complex road sections. Overall, more crashes were reported at priority intersections and midblocks than at roundabouts, but the crash rate (per road section) was higher at roundabouts, where mind wandering was least likely to be reported. These findings suggest that although drivers' minds wander constantly, driving focus is commanded in demanding situations and in response to the actions of other road users. While mind wandering is ubiquitous, drivers are least likely to report mind wandering at locations showing the highest crash rates. More work is needed to test these findings and to provide direction for road safety interventions.}

Inattention arising from external distractions has received much less consideration beyond the impact of mobile phone use. We aimed to investigate the association between distraction behind the wheel and risk of being responsible for a road traffic crash in a responsibility case-control study. The study population included 1912 drivers injured in a road traffic crash recruited in two rounds of recruitment (from April 2010 to August 2011 and from March 2013 to January 2015) in the adult emergency department of Bordeaux University Hospital (France). Responsibility levels were estimated using a standardized method. Self-reported activities among a pre-established list of potential distractions were combined into four external distraction variables: visual distraction, manual distraction, auditory distraction, and verbal interaction. A significantly increased risk of being responsible for a road traffic crash was associated with the exposure to activities that take drivers’ eyes off the road (adjusted odds ratio 2.99, 95% confidence interval 1.42–6.28) and activities that take drivers’ hands off the wheel (adjusted odds ratio 2.12, 95% confidence interval 1.20–3.75). No significant associations were found for verbal interaction and listening to the radio and/or singing. This study suggests that beyond the use of mobile phone, particular attention must be paid to activities that involve visual and/or manual distraction.}

abstract = {This study was designed to investigate the relative accident risk of different road weather conditions and combinations of conditions. The study applied a recently developed method which is based on the notion of Palm probability, originating in the theory of random point processes, which in this case corresponds to picking a random vehicle from the traffic. The method consists of calculating the Palm distribution of different conditions and comparing it with the distribution of the same conditions as seen by the accidents. The condition affects the accident risk statistically, when these two distributions differ. The study included all police reported single- and multi-vehicle accidents (N = 10,646) occurring on 43 main roads in Finland during the years 2014–2016. A major contribution of this paper is the demonstration of the method on national scale by using estimated hourly traffic volumes on road segments instead of measured ones, which would have been available for few roads only. Accident risks are commonly examined in relation to traffic volume. This paper includes the speed of the traffic and thus, the paper examines accident risk in relation to the time spent on the road segment in certain conditions. The hour-level weather and road condition data per segment were obtained from nearby road weather stations. The relative accident risks were increased for poor road weather conditions; however, they were highest for icy rain and slippery and very slippery road conditions. When comparing the relative accident risk based on road type, the results showed that the risk in poor weather and road conditions was higher on motorways compared to two-lane and multiple-lane roads even though the overall risk was lower on motorways. Furthermore, the corresponding relative accident risks were generally higher for single-vehicle accidents compared to multi-vehicle accidents.}

As an active transport mode, the act of walking is sensitive to changes in weather conditions. However, comprehensive real-time weather data are often unavailable for road safety analysis. In this study, we used a geographical information system approach to integrate high-resolution weather data, as well as their corresponding temporal and spatial distributions, with crash data. Then, we established a mixed logit model to determine the association between pedestrian crash severity and possible risk factors. The results indicate that high temperature and the presence of rain were associated with a higher likelihood of Killed and Severe Injury (KSI) crashes. Also, we found the interaction effects of weather condition (hot weather and presence of rain) on the association between pedestrian crash severity and pedestrian and driver behaviors to be significant. For instance, the effects of jaywalking and risky driving behavior on crash severity were more prevalent under rainy conditions. In addition, the effects of driver inattention and reckless crossing were more significant in hot weather conditions. This has critical policy implications for the development and implementation of proactive traffic management systems. For instance, real-time weather and traffic data should be incorporated into dynamic message signs and in-vehicle warning systems. Doing so will enhance the levels of safety awareness of drivers and pedestrians, especially in adverse weather conditions. As a result, pedestrian safety can be improved over the long term.}

However, as accident rates have continued to fall, this approach has become problematic as accident ‘black spots’ have been treated and the number of accidents at any individual site has fallen, making previous accident history a less reliable indicator of future accident risk. Another way of identifying sites of higher accident risk might be to identify near-miss accidents (where an accident nearly happened but was avoided). The principal aim of this paper is to analyze potentially unsafe truck driving conditions from counts of Harsh Braking Incidents (HBIs) at roundabouts and compare the results to similar, previous studies of accident numbers at the same sites, to explore if HBIs can be studied as a surrogate for accidents. This is achieved by processing truck telematics data with geo-referenced incidents of harsh braking. Models are then developed to characterise the relationships between truck HBIs and geometric and traffic variables. These HBIs are likely to occur more often than accidents and may, therefore, be useful in identifying sites with high accident risk. Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that HBIs are influenced by traffic and geometric variables in a similar way to accidents; therefore they may be useful in considering accident risk at roundabouts. They are a source of higher volumes of data than accidents, which is important in considering changes or trends in accident risk over time. The results showed that random-parameters count data models provide better goodness of fit compared to fixed-parameters models and more variables were found to be significant, giving a better prediction of events.}

Drugged driving crashes have significantly increased over the past two decades. The objectives of this study were to identify and characterize the drugs present in motor vehicle driver fatalities using multiple surveillance data sources; assess concordance of the data sources in identifying drug presence; and identify demographic and crash factors associated with drug and alcohol screening in fatally injured motor vehicle drivers.
Methods
Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), Collision Report Analysis for Safer Highways (CRASH), and mortality data sets were linked; drug screening and positive drug screens were identified. Chi-square and conditional logistic regression were performed.
Results
The use of FARS data identified the majority of positive drug screens in the linked data set. Supplementation of FARS data with death certificate and CRASH data increased identification of specific drugs and drug classes detected among fatally injured motor vehicle drivers, although there was a low concordance among the data sources. Alcohol and depressants such as alprazolam had the highest frequencies among fatally injured drivers. Speeding, lack of occupant restraints, young age, commercial truck drivers, and speeding were all factors associated with increased odds of the fatally injured driver being drug or alcohol screened.
Conclusions
These findings indicate that FARS drug information data may be strengthened through increased autopsy and consultation with medical examiners to better understand and interpret decedent toxicology testing results, and that states with low driver drug testing rates should consider mandatory driver drug testing in fatal crashes.}

This study investigated the influence of driving demands, secondary task characteristics, and personal characteristics on behavioural adaptation of mobile phone distracted drivers. In particular, distracted drivers’ self-regulation at strategic, tactical, and operational levels was investigated through a driving simulator experiment. In a high-fidelity driving simulator, participants driving through various driving conditions (e.g. interactions with pedestrian crossings, signalized intersections, merging ramps, roundabouts, etc.) needed to decide where and how to perform the following four mobile phone tasks: (a) ring a doctor and cancel an appointment, (b) text a friend and tell him/her that the participant will be arriving 10 min late, (c) share the doctor’s phone number with a friend, and (d) take a ‘selfie’. At a strategic level, the decision to pull over was modelled as a function of self-reported personal/attitudinal characteristics with a logistic regression model. Similarly, tactical self-regulation (decision to engage in a task while driving in a specific situation) and operational self-regulation (decision to temporarily stop the mobile phone task) were modelled as a function of driving demands and personal/attitudinal characteristics using a random-effects logistic regression model, which accounts for correlations resulting from multiple observations of a driver. Results suggest that tactical self-regulation is more common among distracted drivers followed by operational and strategic self-regulation. Personal beliefs regarding how safe it is to use the mobile phone for texting/browsing while driving were predictors of self-regulation for all levels. Drivers were observed to use the mobile phone more when the driving demands are low, e.g. while stopped at an intersection. This research suggests that distracted drivers engage in various levels of self-regulation, and future research could be focused on further theoretical refinement and development of technology-based interventions.}

Side impact motor vehicle collisions (MVC) represent a significant burden of mortality and morbidity caused by automotive injury within the United States. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between upper extremity (UE) injury patterns and contact sources in side impact MVC with occupant and crash variables.
Methods
Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network data obtained from 1998 to 2012 were used to evaluate UE injuries in side impact crashes. First row drivers and passengers that were at least 16 years old with complete crash information were included. Side impact crashes were defined to have an area of deformation to the side of the vehicle and a principal direction of force between 60° and 120° or 240° and 300°. Injuries were stratified by type, anatomic location, and Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) severity. Occupant variables included age, sex, height, weight, body mass index, and Injury Severity Score. Vehicle and crash variables included in the analysis were change in vehicle velocity at the time of impact, maximum door intrusion, maximum B-pillar intrusion, seat track position, belt use, vehicle type, impact type, and injury source. Statistical analysis of the UE injury data included descriptive statistics, linear regression analyses with occupant variables, and logistic regression analyses with vehicle and crash variables.
Results
There were 903 UE injuries among 408 case occupants. The most common injury type was soft tissue injury (72.5%). The majority of fractures were proximal to and including the humerus (70.3%) with the clavicle being the most common fracture location (N = 89). AIS 2+ UE injuries were associated with a significantly higher mean occupant Injury Severity Score than AIS 1 UE injuries (p = 0.01). Contact with the door was the leading cause of UE injury (34.2%). The odds (OR [95% confidence interval], p-value) of an AIS 2+ UE injury due to contact with the B-pillar (5.3 [3.1, 9.1], <0.0001), door (1.9 [1.3, 2.7], 0.0006), and steering wheel/assembly (2.7 [1.1, 6.3], 0.03) were significantly higher than all other injury sources combined. Scapula fractures were significantly associated with rearward seat track positions (1.46 [1.04, 2.05], 0.03).
Conclusions
This study provides insight into UE injury patterns in side impact MVC. The clavicle was the most common UE fracture location. Contact with the door resulted in the highest number of UE injuries and the B-pillar resulted in the most severe injuries. Additionally, exposure to greater B-pillar intrusion was associated with increased odds of scapula and clavicle fractures in side impacts.}

This study aimed to examine the relationship between shoulder characteristics and crash occurrences on two-lane rural roads in Israel. The study database combined information on crash numbers, traffic volumes and road infrastructure characteristics of 3594 road sections. To examine a relationship between shoulder characteristics and crashes, given other road characteristics, two types of statistical models were developed: case-control and negative-binomial regression models, for several crash types. We found that the impacts of shoulder width and other road characteristics on crashes were generally consistent across various models and crash types, where a non-monotonous link between the shoulder width and crashes was typically observed. For various crash types, the models showed an increase in crash risk with an initial extension of the total shoulder, up to 2.2 m, and a consequent decrease in crashes with a further shoulder widening, over 2.2 m, by 2–6% and 1–4%, respectively, for each 0.1 m of shoulder extension. An increase in the width of unpaved shoulders, over 0.9 m, was associated with increased crash risk, in injury and total crashes, by 5% for each 0.1 m of shoulder extension. Lowest crash risks were found for total shoulder widths of about 3 m or more, but also for narrow total shoulders, below 1 m. Conversely, medium total shoulders, of 1.8–2.4 m in width, and unpaved shoulders of over 1 m, were associated with an increase in crash risk and, hence, are not recommended for use. The tools developed in the study may assist in decision-making during the design stages of a new road or upgrading existing road sections, on two-lane local roads.}

We evaluated associations between the installation of eleven street design elements, between 2007 and 2015, and subsequent changes in vehicle-to-pedestrian collisions in New York City.
Methods
Collision data were from Accident Location Information System in the New York State Department of Transportation. Safety improvement projects at 118 intersections were reviewed and their implemented street design elements were identified. First, we assessed potential regression-to-the-mean effects using historic trends of pedestrian collision count at the intersection project locations. Second, we used a two-group pretest-posttest design to assess individual element’s associations with pedestrian collision reduction after installations. Pedestrian collision count and pedestrian- and vehicle-based pedestrian collision rates were examined. Third, regression trees were used to classify the intersections with design elements as independent variables for the target variables of collision outcomes, to identify street design element combinations associated with pedestrian collision reductions.
Results
Treatments with pedestrian refuge island or pedestrian plaza had reductions in pedestrian collision count and pedestrian-based collision rate while their comparisons had no changes. Treatments with pedestrian refuge island had a larger reduction in pedestrian collision when combined with lane removal or narrowing. Treatment with curb extension or pedestrian plaza had reductions in vehicle-based pedestrian collision rate while their comparisons had no changes. Other studied elements showed no, small, or insignificant associations with post-project pedestrian collision reductions.}

Age was associated with all factors except for need for an ambulance and the distribution law of these factors differed with age groups. Elderly passengers (aged 66 years and above) accounted for the highest proportion of all injuries (49.1%), and failing to stand firm (18.63%) was the main cause of escalator-related injuries of elderly passengers. The most common mechanism of injury for all age groups was a fall, accounting for (51.0%) injuries. Proportion of injuries caused by a fall increased with age, whereas injuries attributed to entrapment decreased. Female passengers (65.9%) were more likely to be involved escalator-related injuries than male passengers (34.1%), while male passengers were more likely to have accidents caused by unhealthy physical condition than female passengers. These results based on the analysis of current accident data can be used to help metro operation corporation develop effective injury prevention measures and document the need for continued improvement of escalator safety in metro stations.}

Roadside observations and interviews are the two main sources for estimating seat belt use rate and have several limitations (e.g., small sample size, social desirability bias). To address these limitations, we attributed seat belt use of individuals who were involved in traffic crashes (N = 542,776) to their corresponding home-addresses. Home-addresses were retrieved from police crash reports and were geocoded, and assigned to their corresponding census tract revealing added information about the spatial distribution of seat belt use and socioeconomics of the areas surrounding the crash victim’s home. The average seat belt use rate in the metropolitan area was 88% and for the non-metropolitan area was 87%. A Tobit model was used to evaluate the relationship between the seat belt use rate for both drivers and passengers over 16 years old, with neighborhood sociodemographic variables. Population, age cohorts, race, household vehicles’ ownership, household size, and education were among the predictors of the seat belt use rate. Results of this analysis could be used in safety campaign design to reach specific geographic areas and groups with a lower seat belt use rate.}

By implementing these parameters in the simulation, basic data concerning these movement behaviours were collected from the experiment, which was carried out at one a Shanghai subway station. Twenty-four young college students participated in this experiment. Numerical simulation results for a stochastic case under those parameters were obtained.

abstract = {The Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) for Streets and Highways recommends hill signs be placed in advance of downgrade descent of mountain passes. Mountain passes increase the risk of a runaway, or out of control trucks and so the advance warning signs inform the driver to take special precautions such as reducing speed or using lower gears during the descent. The Wyoming Department of Transportation has installed steep grade advance warning systems on Wyoming mountain passes. However, concerns for out of control trucks on the mountain passes persist. The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety effectiveness of steep grade advance warning signs for trucks on Wyoming mountain passes. The safety evaluation was carried out by implementing a zero-inflated negative binomial modeling technique for predicting truck crashes on mountain passes. The outcome was two models that showed the risk of runaway truck accidents were high at locations where either the grades were steep and long or the grades were long with multiple vertical curves. The analysis showed the current advance warning systems were not significantly impacting truck crash risks at the high risk locations. The study, therefore, recommends some improvements to the current advanced warning signs or implementing an improved Federal Highway Administration Grade Severity Rating System based warning system that will significantly improve truck safety at the hazardous locations. The study informs policy makers on the safety issues on Wyoming Mountain passes with regards to runaway trucks and makes recommendations for reducing the risk of runaway truck crashes on mountain passes.}

The primary purpose of this study was to investigate intrinsic features of unlawful non-motorized vehicles' violation behaviors of riding on motorized vehicle lanes. The binary logistic regression model was proposed to find inherent reasons of triggering such misbehaviors. The misbehaviors of non-motorized vehicles (including regular bicycles, electric bicycles and human-powered tricycles) at seven sections, located at Hefei, China, were collected and studied. The experimental results indicate that male traffic participants exhibit higher rates of traffic violations than females, and rainy days shows higher misbehaviors than sunny and cloudy days. Another finding is that morning peak violation rate is higher than the evening peak and non-peak hours due to the fact people are in hurry for work. The traffic density of motorized vehicles and the traffic density of non-motorized vehicles strongly affect illegal occupancy behavior. The effect of dividing strip type and non-motorized vehicle type on lane illegal occupancy behavior are significant. We find that the average lane illegal occupancy rate of non-motorized vehicle is 36.1% which suggests that over one-third of non-motorized riders violate traffic rules. The findings of this study can help traffic authorities, road construction departments and traffic participants perform effective and efficient measurements to improve road traffic safety.}

The result of the exploratory factor analysis revealed clear three-factor solution (‘Functionality’, ‘External affective demand’ and ‘Internal requirement’) of TCS with high item loadings and acceptable internal consistency coefficients. The convergent validity of the Chinese TCS was supported by its relationship with driver behaviour factors (violations, errors, lapses and positive behaviours), the traffic accidents involvement and demographic characteristics. The results further show that the external affective demand consistently and positively relate to aberrant behaviours and negatively relate to positive behaviours with indirect positive significant effects on accidents involvement. Functionality is concurrently and negatively related to aberrant behaviours and positively related to positive behaviours with no effects on accidents involvement. The internal requirement is negatively related to aberrant behaviours but, positively related to positive behaviours with positive significant direct effects on accidents involvement.}

This skill develops with experience and may be developed through training. We assumed that as any other skill, HP developed through implicit learning. Nevertheless, current training methods, rely on deliberate learning where young-inexperienced drivers are instructed what hazards that they should seek and where they might be located. In this exploratory study, we investigated the effectiveness of a novel training procedure, in which learners were repeatedly exposed to target video clips of driving scenarios embedded within filler scenarios. Each of the target videos included scenarios of either a visible hazard, a hidden materialized hazard or hidden unmaterialized hazard. Twenty-three young-inexperienced drivers and 35 experienced drivers participated in training session followed by a learning transference testing session and 24 additional young-inexperienced drivers participated only in the transference testing session with no training, during which participants were shown novel hazards video clips. Participants responded by pressing a button when they identified a hazard. Eye movement was also tracked using fixations patterns as a proxy to evaluate HP performance. During training, young-inexperienced drivers gradually increased their focus on visible materialized hazards but exhibited no learning curve with respect to hidden hazards. During the learning transference session, both trained groups focused on hazards earlier compared to untrained drivers. These results imply that repetitive training may facilitate HP acquisition among young-inexperienced drivers. Patterns concerning experienced drivers are also discussed.}

This skill is traditionally measured by recording response times to hazards in video clips of driving, with safer, experienced drivers often out-performing inexperienced drivers. This study assessed whether HP test performance is culturally specific by comparing Chinese, Spanish and UK drivers who watched clips filmed in all three countries. Two test-variants were created: a traditional HP test (requiring timed hazard responses), and a hazard prediction test, where the film is occluded at hazard-onset and participants predict what happens next. More than 300 participants, across the 3 countries, were divided into experienced and inexperienced-driver groups. The traditional HP test did not discriminate between experienced and inexperienced drivers, though participant nationality influenced the results with UK drivers reporting more hazards than Chinese drivers. The hazard prediction test, however, found experienced drivers to out-perform inexperienced drivers. No differences were found for nationality, with all nationalities being equally skilled at predicting hazards. The results suggest that drivers’ criterion level for responding to hazards is culturally sensitive, though their ability to predict hazards is not. We argue that the more robust, culturally-agnostic, hazard prediction test appears better suited for global export.}

And driver scheduling has long been suspected as the root cause affecting sleepiness and fatigue. As such, a fundamental question for intercity bus carriers is how to reduce crashes associated with driver schedules, while maintaining a nonstop service? This research seeks to develop a paradigm to minimize overall fleet crash risk by rescheduling. In this study, we first identified those driving schedules associated with the highest crash risks, and a rescheduling scheme is then proposed to reduce fleet crashes overall. A case-study approach was employed to identify driver scheduling associated with higher crash risk, and a mathematical program was then formulated to minimize fleet crash risk. Our results showed that several types of driver schedules would lead to higher crash risk; for example: (1) working in the afternoon or early hours in the morning for two consecutive days; and (2) commencing a driving shift in the mornings, the afternoon or the early hours of the morning after being off-duty for more than 24 h. To meet the challenge of maintaining a nonstop service while simultaneously minimizing the crash risk associated with these risk patterns, a mathematical program was developed, and it was found that rescheduling based on our algorithm could reduce the incidence of crashes by approximately 30 percent.}

abstract = {Computer-based hazard perception tests are used in a number of countries as part of the driver licensing processes, and hence evaluating the validity of such tests is crucial. One strategy for assessing the validity of the scores generated by a hazard perception test is to determine whether they can predict on-road driving performance. Only a few prior studies have attempted this, all relying on the subjective ratings of an examiner who was present during a single brief drive and was not blind to the driver’s demographic characteristics, potentially contaminating the outcomes. Additionally, only one such study focused on the most relevant participant group with respect to the validity of tests used in licencing processes, namely young drivers. We sought to remedy this situation in the present project by measuring young drivers’ performance over an extended period of everyday driving via g-force triggered video cameras (“dashcams”) installed in their own vehicles. As a precursor to the dashcam study itself, we developed a new computerized hazard perception test and assessed the validity of its scores by more traditional means (Study 1). As expected, test scores distinguished between high-risk and lower-risk driver groups, and correlated with scores on an established hazard perception test previously shown to predict crash risk. In the subsequent dashcam study (Study 2), the frequency of heavy-braking events (controlling for distance driven) was used as a more objective measure of driving performance. Results indicated that drivers with higher rates of heavy braking had slower hazard perception response times, further supporting the use of these scores as a valid measure of drivers’ ability to exercise hazard perception skill during real driving. More generally, this study also demonstrates the viability of using low-cost off-the-shelf dashcams to measure real-world driving behaviour.}

However, walking is one of the main forms of travel for children, particularly during leisure hours. Child pedestrian injury primarily occurs in urban areas, with a significant share at crosswalks. This study observed child pedestrian behaviors at crosswalks of urban intersections aiming to characterize their behavior patterns and identify risk factors that may lead to injury. Crossing behaviors of children and adolescents up to age 18, during leisure hours, were video-recorded at 29 crosswalks, on signalized and un-signalized intersections situated on collector roads. Some children used pedestrian crosswalks while riding a bicycle or other non-motorized means; they were also included in the sample. Behaviors of 2930 young road users were encoded and compared by age groups. Multivariate logistic regression models were adjusted to identify factors associated with crossing on red and with non-checking vehicle traffic at un-signalized crosswalks. The findings pointed to different behavior patterns for the various child age groups. Risk-taking behaviors are higher for older children; adolescents aged 14–17 cross more on red, without checking traffic, outside crosswalk boundaries and while distracted. At all types of sites, a fifth of children over the age of 9 crossed by riding, the probability of crossing on red and of non-checking traffic prior to crossing at an un-signalized crosswalk was higher for children riding an electric bicycle or kick-scooter. The non-checking of traffic was also higher when a child is distracted by a mobile phone or other electronic gadget, or carries a big object. Children under age 9 were usually accompanied by adults but still exhibited risk-taking behaviors that apparently mirrored those of the adults. Risk-taking behaviors of young road users should be taken into account in the development of injury prevention programs focusing on child and parent education and training, and by adapting the urban environment to better meet their needs.}

abstract = {While high road safety performing countries base their effective strategies on reliable data, in developing countries the unavailability of essential information makes this task challenging. As a result, this drawback has led researchers and planners to face dilemmas of “doing nothing” or “doing ill”, therefore restricting models to data availability, often limited to socio-economic and demographic variables. Taking this into account, this study aims to demonstrate the potential improvements in spatial crash prediction model performance by enhancing the explanatory variables and modelling casualties as a function of a more comprehensive dataset, especially with an appropriate exposure variable. This includes experimental work, where models based on available information from São Paulo, Brazil, and Flanders, the Dutch speaking area of Belgium, are developed and compared with each other. Prediction models are developed within the framework of Geographically Weighted Regression with the Poisson distribution of errors. Moreover, casualties and fatalities as the response variables in the models developed for Flanders and São Paulo, respectively, are divided into two sets based on the transport mode, called active (i.e., pedestrians and cyclists) and motorized transport (i.e., motorized vehicle occupants). In order to assess the impacts of the enriched information on model performance, casualties are firstly associated with all available variables for São Paulo and the corresponding ones for Flanders. In the next step, prediction models are developed only for Flanders considering all the available information in the Flemish dataset. Findings showed that by adding the supplementary data, reductions of 20% and 25% for motorized transport, and 25% and 35% for active transport resulted in AICc and MSPE, respectively. Considering the practical aspects, results could help identify hotspots and relate most influential factors, suggesting sites and data, which should be prioritized in future local investigations. Besides minimizing costs with data collection, it could help policy makers to identify, implement and enforce appropriate countermeasures.}

A total of 5538 crashes were recorded at 326 freeway diverge areas. In the model calibration, several parameters including the number of trees in three base classification methods, learning rate, and regularization coefficient are optimized via a systematic grid search approach. In the model validation, the performance of the Stacking model is compared with several traditional models including the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Random Forests (RF) in the multi classification experiments. The prediction results show that Stacking model achieves superior performance evaluated by two indicators: accuracy and recall. Furthermore, all the factors used in severity prediction are classified into different categories according to their influence on the results, and sensitivity analysis of several significant factors is finally implemented to explore the impact of their value variation on the prediction accuracy.}

Census tracts are used as the basic geographic units to capture crash, transportation, land use, and demo-economic data. The specification of the proposed multivariate model allows for jointly modeling counts of various crash types that are classified according to injury severity. Results of Moran’s I tests show the ability of the MVCAR model to capture the multivariate spatial autocorrelation among different crash types. The MVCAR model is found to outperform the others by presenting the lowest deviance information criterion (DIC) value. It is also found that the unobserved heterogeneity was mostly attributed to spatial factors instead of non-spatial ones and there is a strong shared geographical pattern of risk among different crash types.}

abstract = {Findings concerning drivers’ response times to sudden events vary considerably across studies due to different experimental setups and situational characteristics, such as expectancy of an event and urgency to react. While response times are widely reported in the literature, understanding of drivers’ choice of maneuvers in time-critical situations is limited. Standardized test scenarios could enhance the comparability of studies and help in attaining a better understanding of driver behavior in these situations. In an effort to achieve these improvements, three driving simulator studies (N = 131) were conducted to investigate drivers’ response time and maneuver choice under a range of situational conditions. Each study took place in a specific environmental setting (urban, rural, and highway) and incorporated one unexpected and 12 subsequent events (increased expectancy). Four different time-critical scenarios were used to evoke different driver responses. In three scenarios, obstacles suddenly entered the roadway (braking, steering, or both possible). A fourth scenario comprised the sudden braking of a leading vehicle (only braking possible). Half of the drivers performed a cognitive secondary task. To validate the findings, results from an additional field test (N = 14) were compared to the results from the simulated urban environment. As expected, response choice was influenced by scenario characteristics (available braking distance and room for evasive maneuvers). Braking maneuvers were more frequent in settings with lower speed limits (urban) while steering maneuvers were found at higher speed limits (highway). Responses to suddenly appearing obstacles were fastest in the urban setting at 540–680 ms; these responses were 200–300 ms slower in the rural and highway settings. Response times increased by 100–200 ms when drivers responded to braking leading vehicles rather than obstacles. Braking responses were 200–350 ms slower and steering responses were 90–200 ms slower when drivers responded to an unexpected event rather than subsequent events. The cognitive secondary task had no significant effect. The simulated environment and the field test produced comparable response behavior. The current study provides reference numbers that help to establish a set of standardized test scenarios for future studies. On basis of this study, nine scenarios are recommended for the context of time-critical crash avoidance maneuvers. Such standardized test scenarios could improve the comparability of future studies on response time and maneuver choice.}

This simulator study investigated drivers’ glance behaviours as indicators of driver distraction when using our Eco-Safe Human-Machine-Interface (HMI). Four types of eco-safe information display conditions (baseline, advice only, feedback only, both advice and feedback) were tested on different traffic situations with varied road traffic complexity. Results showed that the eco-safe HMI system did not cause visual distraction. In contrast, the advice only or feedback only information improved forward gazing on the roadway. In addition, drivers tended to adapt their visual scanning strategies according to the traffic situations. In the car-following situation they paid longer glances to the forward roadway, while in the intersections they spent more time to look at the HMI system. The findings indicated that our eco-safe driving system improved drivers’ eco-safe behaviours and meanwhile enhanced their visual attention on road while no evidence showed that drivers were distracted by it.}

abstract = {The primary objective of this study is to investigate how the deep learning approach contributes to citywide short-term crash risk prediction by leveraging multi-source datasets. This study uses data collected from Manhattan in New York City to illustrate the procedure. The following multiple datasets are collected: crash data, large-scale taxi GPS data, road network attributes, land use features, population data and weather data. A spatiotemporal convolutional long short-term memory network (STCL-Net) is proposed for predicting the citywide short-term crash risk. A total of nine prediction tasks are conducted and compared, including weekly, daily and hourly models with 8 × 3, 15 × 5 and 30 × 10 grids, respectively. The results suggest that the prediction performance of the proposed model decreases as the spatiotemporal resolution of prediction task increases. Moreover, four commonly-used econometric models, and four state-of-the-art machine-learning models are selected as benchmark methods to compare with the proposed STCL-Net for all the crash risk prediction tasks. The comparative analyses suggest that in general the proposed STCL-Net outperforms the benchmark methods for different crash risk prediction tasks in terms of higher prediction accuracy rate and lower false alarm rate. The results verify that the proposed spatiotemporal deep learning approach performs better at capturing the spatiotemporal characteristics for the citywide short-term crash risk prediction. In addition, the comparative analyses also reveal that econometric models perform better than machine-learning models in weekly crash risk prediction tasks, while they exhibit worse results than machine-learning models in daily crash risk prediction tasks. The results can potentially guide transportation safety engineers to select appropriate methods for different crash risk prediction tasks.}

abstract = {Introduction
The economic value of safety represents an important guide to transport policy, and more studies on individuals’ valuation of road safety are called for. This paper presents a stated preference study of the value of preventing fatal and serious injuries involving bus passengers and car drivers in road accidents.
Objectives
Former valuation studies based on travel behaviour and route choice have involved primarily car drivers. Our study also included bus passengers, thus providing a comparison of two types of transport mode users. Moreover, the comparison was based on two different valuation methods.
Methodology
About 600 bus passengers and nearly 2300 car users from different areas of Norway reported a recent trip, described by its distance and travel cost. Then they answered stated choice tasks that took a reference in the reported trip and involved trade-offs among travel time, fatal and seriously injured victims and travel costs. Afterwards, they faced a simple trade-off between travel costs, and fatal and seriously injured victims.
Findings
Pooling the data from the two stated preference formats, we derived values of a statistical life and of a statistical seriously injured victim. Regarding the value of statistical life, our point estimates were NOK 45.5 million and NOK 58.3 million for bus users and car users respectively.
Discussion
The point estimates for bus passengers and car users were not statistically different given their confidence intervals. Thus, we recommend the use of a single value, identical for both modes of transport, for the prevention of a statistical fatality as well as for a statistical injury}

abstract = {Over the past decade in Melbourne the popularity of cycling has increased both as a mode of transport and a recreational activity, while at the same time walking has consistently been the most prevalent form of physical activity. Increasing levels of active transport use and physical activity are seen as important public health issues, particularly as the rate of urbanisation continues to grow throughout the world. To date there has been limited research conducted in Australia looking at the prevalence of pedestrian injuries resulting from collisions with cyclists. However there is a potential for the issues surrounding pedestrian and cyclist conflict to increase, given the growing uptake of these modes of transport, the continued densification of the urban environment and the lack of cycling specific infrastructure in many Australian capital cities. This study investigated the prevalence of pedestrian injuries resulting from collisions with cyclists in Melbourne, Australia. The intention was to quantify the extent of these collisions and identify if the rate of collisions was increasing, which may highlight a growing road safety issue. Furthermore the study sought to identify any unique characteristic and injury outcomes associated with this collision type. Aggregate analyses of two Victorian data sources were undertaken to enhance our understanding of pedestrian injuries resulting from collisions with cyclists, the Victorian Injury Surveillance Unit (VISU) and Victorian Police Report Crash Data (Crash Stats). The analysis demonstrated that over the past ten years there does not appear to have been a substantial increase in the number of pedestrian injuries resulting from collisions with cyclists. Furthermore the prevalence of injuries was small, especially when compared to injuries sustained by pedestrians from collisions with motor vehicles. The findings highlight that efforts to increase active transport participation should be encouraged and there may be situations where is it suitable to increase interaction and sharing of space between pedestrians and cyclists.}

abstract = {Background: Distracted driving is of particular concern among young drivers. According to the 2012 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) survey, the greatest proportion of distraction prone drivers is within the 16–19 and 20–24 age groups. One relatively new distraction is texting while driving behaviour (TWD). TWD increases the amount of time drivers spend looking away from the road, slows reaction times and increases the risk of collisions by two-fold. To deter this behaviour many distracted driving campaigns focus on highlighting the risks and dangers of distracted driving; however, evidence suggests that youth and young adults continue to engage in TWD despite awareness of the related risks. Previous studies have examined constructs from the theory of planned behaviour as predictors of TWD (e.g., attitudes, intentions). Understanding the full range of factors that may influence this behaviour can inform the development of evidence-based public awareness campaigns and related interventions. Purpose: The purpose of this paper was to examine predictors of TWD behaviour among youth and young adults. We examined constructs from the theory of planned behaviour in addition to the role played by perceived TWD driving skills, experience with collisions due to TWD, descriptive norms (i.e., an individual’s beliefs about a behaviour that are gained as a result of observing the actions of others) and risk perceptions. Methods: An online survey was administered to 2001 Ontario youth and young adults examining potential predictors of TWD behaviour. Regression models were used to examine which key variables were associated with TWD (both reading and sending behaviour) among participants. Results: Overall, regression models had good predictability for reading and sending behaviours. Perceived TWD driving skills and ‘almost getting in a collision due to TWD’ were positively associated with TWD behaviour in the past week (both reading and sending behaviours). Descriptive norms were positively associated with sending text messages while driving in the past week, but were not significant for reading. In contrast, risk perceptions were positively associated with reading text messages in the past week but not sending. Discussion and conclusion: The results from this study highlight constructs that can be used to design interventions to deter young drivers from engaging in TWD. Interventions targeting perceived TWD driving skills and descriptive norms have the potential to be more effective than interventions emphasizing risk perceptions. Future studies are needed to better understand the relationships between these predictors and TWD behaviour among this population.}

Improvements in overconfidence bias and descriptive norms were predictive of improvements in high-risk driving behaviors.

abstract = {Objective
Teens’ crash risk is highest in the first years of independent driving. Circumstances surrounding fatal crashes have been widely documented, but less is known about factors related to nonfatal teen driver crashes. This study describes single vehicle nonfatal crashes involving the youngest teen drivers (15–17 years), compares these crashes to single vehicle nonfatal crashes among adult drivers (35–44 years) and examines factors related to nonfatal injury producing crashes for teen drivers.
Methods
Police crash data linked to hospital inpatient and emergency department data for 2005–2008 from the South Carolina Crash Outcomes Data Evaluation System (CODES) were analyzed. Nonfatal, single vehicle crashes involving passenger vehicles occurring on public roadways for teen (15–17 years) drivers were compared with those for adult (35–44 years) drivers on temporal patterns and crash risk factors per licensed driver and per vehicle miles traveled. Vehicle miles traveled by age group was estimated using data from the 2009 National Household Travel Survey. Multivariable log-linear regression analysis was conducted for teen driver crashes to determine which characteristics were related to crashes resulting in a minor/moderate injury or serious injury to at least one vehicle occupant.
Results
Compared with adult drivers, teen drivers in South Carolina had 2.5 times the single vehicle nonfatal crash rate per licensed driver and 11 times the rate per vehicle mile traveled. Teen drivers were nearly twice as likely to be speeding at the time of the crash compared with adult drivers. Teen driver crashes per licensed driver were highest during the afternoon hours of 3:00–5:59 pm and crashes per mile driven were highest during the nighttime hours of 9:00–11:59 pm. In 66% of the teen driver crashes, the driver was the only occupant. Crashes were twice as likely to result in serious injury when teen passengers were present than when the teen driver was alone. When teen drivers crashed while transporting teen passengers, the passengers were >5 times more likely to all be restrained if the teen driver was restrained. Crashes in which the teen driver was unrestrained were 80% more likely to result in minor/moderate injury and 6 times more likely to result in serious injury compared with crashes in which the teen driver was restrained.
Conclusions
Despite the reductions in teen driver crashes associated with Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL), South Carolina’s teen driver crash rates remain substantially higher than those for adult drivers. Established risk factors for fatal teen driver crashes, including restraint nonuse, transporting teen passengers, and speeding also increase the risk of nonfatal injury in single vehicle crashes. As South Carolina examines strategies to further reduce teen driver crashes and associated injuries, the state could consider updating its GDL passenger restriction to either none or one passenger <21years and dropping the passenger restriction exemption for trips to and from school. Surveillance systems such as CODES that link crash data with health outcome data provide needed information to more fully understand the circumstances and consequences of teen driver nonfatal crashes and evaluate the effectiveness of strategies to improve teen driver safety.}

Nevertheless, none has explored the impact of socio-demographic and trip generation parameters on real-time crash risk. This study analyzed the real-time crash risk for expressway ramps using traffic, geometric, socio-demographic, and trip generation predictors. Two Bayesian logistic regression models were utilized to identify crash precursors and their impact on ramp crash risk. Meanwhile, four Support Vector Machines (SVM) were applied to predict crash occurrence. Bayesian logistic regression models and SVMs commonly showed that the models with the socio-demographic and trip generation variables outperform their counterparts without those parameters. It indicates that the socio-demographic and trip generation parameters have significant impact on the real-time crash risk. The Bayesian logistic regression model results showed that the logarithm of vehicle count, speed, and percentage of home-based-work production had positive impact on crash risk. Meanwhile, off-ramps or non-diamond-ramps experienced higher crash potential than on-ramps or diamond-ramps, respectively. Though the SVMs provided good model performance, the SVM model with all variables (i.e., all traffic, geometric, socio-demographic, and trip generation variables) had an overfitting problem. Therefore, it is recommended to build SVM models based on significant variables identified by other models, such as logistic regression.}

In this paper, we report and discuss the results of a drivers’ survey, administered both in the US and Israel, regarding the benefits, concerns and policy considerations for the deployment of traffic enforcement drones. The results show that drivers perceive traffic enforcement drones as significantly more efficient and deterring compared to current aerial traffic enforcement resources (i.e., police helicopters) and comparable in quality to speed cameras. Privacy and safety are the main concerns expressed with regards to such technology, yet these concerns have been shown to be significantly relieved if traffic enforcement drones are restricted to interurban spaces. Interestingly, only a few Israeli participants object to the introduction of traffic enforcement drones to the traffic police's arsenal compared to about half of American participants. These results combine to suggest several practical guidelines for decision-makers which can facilitate the deployment of this potentially life-saving technology in the field.}

However, specific data on red light running of e-bike riders (pedelec and S-pedelec riders), a population of cyclists that has been growing steadily in the past few years in Germany and elsewhere, is largely missing. Similarly unclear is the role of the used infrastructure (e.g., carriageway or bike path) or the intersection type on the riders’ propensity to run the red light. The goal of this study was to investigate the red light running behaviour of three different bicycle types (bicycle, pedelec, S-pedelec) in Germany, with specific focus on various infrastructure characteristics. We reanalysed data obtained in a naturalistic cycling study, in which we observed 90 participants riding their own bicycles (conventional bicycles, pedelecs, S-pedelecs) on their daily trips over four weeks each. The video material of these trips was annotated and analysed with regard to red light running. Overall, our participants experienced nearly 8000 red light situations. In 16.3% of these situations, they ran the red light, with nearly identical rates for cyclists, pedelec and S-pedelec riders. Red light running rates were lowest when cyclists rode on the carriageway, while the complexity of the intersection appeared to play a role as well. In general, red light running was more common when riders were about to turn right instead of turning left or riding straight through the intersection. Interestingly, we also observed a considerable number of cases in which the riders changed their used infrastructure (e.g., from the carriageway onto the pavement) to avoid a red light.}

While biomechanical limits and the relationship between speed and injury outcome has been extensively investigated for car occupants and pedestrians, research analyzing this relationship for motorcyclists remains limited. The aim of this study was to address this issue by developing multivariate injury risk models for motorcyclists that estimate the relationship between speed and injury severity. For that purpose, motorcycle injury crashes from the German In-Depth Accident Study (GIDAS) database for the period 1999–2017 (n = 1037) were extracted. Different models were tested using logistic regression and backwards elimination of non-significant variables. The best fitting model in the current study included relative speed, type of crash opponent, impact location on the motorcycle and impact mechanism of the rider during the crash. A strong and significant relationship between relative speed and injury severity in motorcycle crashes was demonstrated. At 70 km/h, the risk for at least serious injuries in collisions with wide objects, crash barriers and narrow objects was 20%, 51%, and 64%, respectively. Further, it was found that head-on collisions between motorcycles and passenger cars, with both vehicles traveling at 60 km/h (a relative speed at 120 km/h), present 55% risk of at least serious injury to the motorcycle rider. More research is needed to fully understand the boundary conditions needed to design a safe road transport system for motorcyclists. However, this study provides important insights into the relationship between speed and injury severity for riders in various crash situations. The results may be useful in the discussion of appropriate speed limits and in determining the benefits of countermeasures which aim to reduce crash speed.}

Motorcycle is an essential and popular mode of transportation in Pakistan, therefore, the present study estimated a random parameters logit model to investigate the factors influencing the motorcycle injury severity using motorcycle crash data of Rawalpindi city collected by the Provincial Emergency Response Service. No injury, minor injury, severe injury and fatal injury are used as four categories of motorcyclist injury severity levels to calibrate the model. Mainly the effects of speed limits, crash-specific factors, rider attributes, roadway characteristics, weather and socio-demographics factors are considered for motorcycle-injury severity analysis. It was revealed that probability of fatal/severe injury increases for crashes: involving middle-aged riders (25–50 years) and riders with no education, occurring on roads with posted speed limit of 70 kms per hour or higher, crashes involving a motorcycle and a heavy vehicle, involving collision of a motorcycle with a fixed object and occurring during dry weather conditions. Also, the probability of minor injury increases for crashes: occurring on divided streets and road segments with a posted speed limit of less than 50 kms per hour, involving Chinese brand motorcycles, involving registered motorcycles, and where at least one motorcycle and auto rickshaw is involved. The research findings suggest that besides measures to control/ reduce the risky motorcyclists behavior there is a need to lower speed limits on roads with a higher motorcycle proportion, separate motorcycles from heavy vehicles and removal of fixed objects from the roadside. Besides data limitations, results are expected to generate more discussion and interest in motorcycle safety in the country and can be used by the enforcement agencies to improve/ enhance the current state of motorcycle safety in the country.}

In the present study, we apply both of these methods of gathering driving data in order to assess risk proneness as accurately as possible. Data were obtained from 131 drivers, who filled in an introductory questionnaire pertaining to their driving habits. Their vehicles were equipped with an external, automatic data-capture device for approximately two months. During that period, the participants reported critical safety events that occurred behind the wheel by (a) pressing a button connected to the device and (b) describing the events in logbooks. They also filled in weekly questionnaires, and at the end of the participation period, a final questionnaire with various self-reported measures pertaining to their driving activity. We processed the data by (a) performing a multiple correspondence analysis of the characteristics assessed via the automatic data capture and self-reports, and (b) categorizing the participants via hierarchical clustering of their coordinates on the dimensions obtained from the correspondence analysis. This allowed us to identify a group of drivers (n = 43) at risk, based on several self-reported measures, in particular, their recent crash involvement, and the frequency of critical acceleration/deceleration events as an objective measure. However, the at-risk drivers did not themselves report more critical safety events than the other two groups.}

The ability to identify risks has weakened, as the responsibility of supply chain risk management is handed over to outside service providers. Regardless, the risks, their visibility and their impact depend on the position of the companies in the supply chain. The actors in the chain must therefore collaborate to create effective risk management conditions. This challenging situation is especially pronounced in multimodal maritime supply chains, where the risks and actor focality are high. This paper contributes to current risk management literature by providing a holistic and systemic view of risk visibility and control in maritime supply chains. The study employs broad-based, qualitative interview data collected from actors operating in southern Finland and the Gulf of Finland as well as an expert-panel assessment of the related risk management abilities. The results show a high level of variance in the level of risk identification and visibility between the actors in question. This further suggests that collaboration in supply chain risk management is essential, as an awareness of the risks and their control mechanisms do not necessarily reside in the same company.}

abstract = {Mixed-flow intersections are prevailing in many developing countries such as China and India. At mixed-flow intersections, there is no clear lane discipline or regular trajectories within the intersection, especially for the non-motorized traffic. This leads to more interactions and encounters between the motorized traffic and the non-motorized traffic. Hence, critical instantaneous decision events such as abrupt accelerating, decelerating, jerking, swerving, and swinging, may occur more frequently, which result in potential traffic conflicts and crashes. This study presents a methodology to identify critical instantaneous decision events at the mixed-flow signalized intersections, based on the entropy theory and high-resolution vehicle trajectory data. A three-dimensional cube searching algorithm is firstly proposed to extract general traffic events by examining the proximity between trajectories. A novel model incorporating vehicle kinematics and Permutation Entropy is then developed to identify critical events, by quantifying driving volatility based on the time-serial trajectory data. Next, 3, 349 vehicle trajectories and 805 bicycle trajectories with a resolution of 0.12 s collected at a signalized intersection in Shanghai are used to demonstrate the proposed method. Results show that the proposed method is capable of identifying critical instantaneous decision events, and tends to produce a higher identification ratio comparing with the conventional method solely based on kinematic thresholds. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to investigate the effects of model parameters on the performance of the proposed method. The presented work could be applied for traffic safety assessment, real-time driving alert systems, and early diagnosis of risk-prone road users at mixed-flow intersections.}

abstract = {Cycling for transportation has multiple benefits to both individuals and societies. However, in many countries, cycling rates are very low. One major deterrent is hostile or aggressive behaviours directed towards cyclists. Past research has established that negative attitudes towards cyclist are a major driver of aggressive behaviour. However, the attitudinal roots that motivate these negative attitudes are currently not well understood. This study investigates to what extent negative attitudes towards cyclists are rooted in a sense of attachment to cars, and environmental attitudes. Furthermore, the study examines whether the distinctiveness of group-membership of cyclists, as signalled by cycling attire, influences the link between attitudes and aggressive behaviours directed at cyclists. An online survey of 308 car drivers measured automobility and environmental attitudes, attitudes towards cyclist, and aggressive behaviour addressed at two groups of cyclists (lycra-clad or casually dressed cyclists). Hierarchical regression analyses showed that automobility attitudes, but not environmental attitudes, were associated with negative car driver attitudes towards cyclists. A significant link between negative attitudes towards cyclists and aggressive behaviour addressed at cyclists was not moderated by the type of cyclist shown. These findings provide a more refined understanding of the basis in which negative attitudes towards cyclists are rooted and how they affect driver behaviour. This research may inform campaigns and initiatives aimed at changing attitudes towards cyclists.}

For this purpose, twelve uncontrolled mid-block crosswalks in Wuhan, China were selected to collect data via field investigation. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze pedestrian crossing behavior, and the distribution of pedestrian-vehicle conflicts on different vehicle lanes was given. Three ordered probit (OP) models for pedestrian-vehicle conflicts analysis (PVCA) were established to measure the effects of various factors on pedestrian safety. Descriptive statistical results showed that crosswalks with different numbers of lanes have diverse impacts on pedestrian crossing behavior and safety. As the number of vehicle lanes increases, the proportion of pedestrians adopting the rolling gap crossing mode, crossing the street with others, and changing the speed or path increase accordingly. Moreover, the number of pedestrian-vehicle conflicts at two-way six-lane crosswalks is 5.96 times higher than that of two-lane crosswalks, and 2.04 times higher than that of four-lane crosswalks. From the results of OP models, it was found that pedestrian behavioral characteristics such as rolling gap crossing mode, crossing with others significantly increased the possibility of pedestrian-vehicle conflicts.}

Risks in seaports need to be appropriately addressed to ensure economic wealth, operational efficiency, and personnel safety. As a result, the safety performance of a Container Terminal Operational System (CTOS) plays a growing role in improving the efficiency of international trade. This paper proposes a novel method to facilitate the application of Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) in assessing the safety performance of CTOS. The new approach is developed through incorporating a Fuzzy Rule-Based Bayesian Network (FRBN) with Evidential Reasoning (ER) in a complementary manner. The former provides a realistic and flexible method to describe input failure information for risk estimates of individual hazardous events (HEs) at the bottom level of a risk analysis hierarchy. The latter is used to aggregate HEs safety estimates collectively, allowing dynamic risk-based decision support in CTOS from a systematic perspective. The novel feature of the proposed method, compared to those in traditional port risk analysis lies in a dynamic model capable of dealing with continually changing operational conditions in ports. More importantly, a new sensitivity analysis method is developed and carried out to rank the HEs by taking into account their specific risk estimations (locally) and their Risk Influence (RI) to a port’s safety system (globally). Due to its generality, the new approach can be tailored for a wide range of applications in different safety and reliability engineering and management systems, particularly when real time risk ranking is required to measure, predict, and improve the associated system safety performance.}

The RWA layout gives guidance to vehicle placement of turning vehicles which improves safety and mitigates vehicle queue overflow of the right-turn vehicles. RWA enhances the capacity of right-turn lanes while alleviating conflict severity in some cases. This study analysed the safety impact of the conflict between opposing straight-through vehicles and right-turn vehicles at RWA junctions in Singapore. A microscopic simulation model based on Fuzzy Cellular Automata (FCA) was developed. Field surveys were carried out to obtain the inputs for calibrating the fuzzy inference system. Different scenarios were analysed and discussed including different types of junctions with and without RWAs. The proposed model is found to be able to simulate decision-making of individual drivers at RWA or before stop line, such as exiting the queueing area or crossing the stop line when faced with different gaps and velocity of opposing straight-through vehicles.}

abstract = {According to NHTSA, more than 3477 people (including 551 non-occupants) were killed and 391,000 were injured due to distraction-related crashes in 2015. The distracted driving epidemic has long been under research to identify its impact on driving behavior. There have been a few attempts to detect drivers’ engagement in secondary tasks from observed driving behavior. Yet, to the authors’ knowledge, not much effort has been directed to identify the types of secondary tasks from driving behavior parameters. This study proposes a bi-level hierarchical classification methodology using machine learning to identify the different types of secondary tasks drivers are engaged in using their driving behavior parameters. At the first level, drivers’ engagement in secondary tasks is detected, while at the second level, the distinct types of secondary tasks are identified. Comparative evaluation is performed between nine ensemble tree classification methods to identify three types of secondary tasks (hand-held cellphone calling, cellphone texting, and interaction with an adjacent passenger). The inputs to the models are five driving behavior parameters (speed, longitudinal acceleration, lateral acceleration, pedal position, and yaw rate) along with their standard deviations. The results showed that the overall secondary task detection accuracy ranged from 66% to 96%, except for the Decision Tree that was able to detect engagement in secondary tasks with a high accuracy of 99.8%. For the identification of secondary tasks types, the overall accuracy ranged from 55% to 79%, with the highest accuracy of 82.2% achieved by the Random Forest method. The findings of the paper show the proposed methodology promising to (1) characterize drivers’ engagement in unlawful secondary tasks (such as texting) as a counter measure to prevent crashes, and (2) alert drivers to pay attention back to the main driving task when risky changes to their driving behavior take place.}

The correlations could also be moderated by a number of study and sample characteristics, such as country of origin, publication year, age, gender, driving experience and type of SS measure. The findings help facilitate our understanding of the role of SS in aberrant driving behaviors and accident risk, and provide new insight into the design of evidence-based driving education and accident prevention interventions.}

However, it was often difficult to capture the safety impact of speed variance with spaced sensor measurements. As an alternative, this paper aims to leverage the use of the floating car data (FCD) to capture the speed variance in a morning rush hour on urban elevated expressways and examine its effect on safety. A semi-automatic filtering process was introduced to distinguish taxi GPS data points on the elevated expressways from the ones on the surface roads under the expressways. Subsequently, the standard deviation of the cross-sectional speed mean (SDCSM) and the cross-section speed standard deviation (MCSSD) were derived to capture the spatial and temporal speed variances, respectively. Together with other explanatory variables, both hierarchical and non-hierarchical Poisson-gamma measurement error models were developed to model the crash frequencies of the expressways. The modeling results showed that the hierarchical model performed better and both SDCSM and MCSSD were found to be positively related to the crash occurrence. This secures the need for addressing the impact of speed variation when modeling crashes occurred on the elevated expressways.}

abstract = {Purpose
It was considered the challenges of the actual response and the potential for improvement, including the activities of the disaster response system, national emergency medical center, and the regional base hospital for the treatment of multiple traffic accident victims. The purpose of this study was to analyze the accident management system through real investigating the multiple collision over 10 vehicles with mass casualty events as a disaster situation.
Methods
This study was retrospective study to analyze the disaster event with multiple collision traffic accident on the expressway in Korea. We visited five medical centers for eight days since the accident occurred and interviewed the injured patients in this accident to examine the health status and medical records. After that, we visited the sixteen car-repair shops in four cities for real investigate about damaged vehicles. According to the arrangement of the accident situation for the accident vehicles through real-world investigation, we reproduced all parts of the accident scene, which were real-world investigated, by the accident situation sketch program. The collected data were summarized by Collision Deformation Classification (CDC) codes, and the medical records of the occupants were assessed using the Injury Severity Score (ISS).
Results
The cause of the accident was snow freezing of the road. The information about 72 injured patients on 31 damaged vehicles was collected by phone, visit, and actual accident investigation. Of the 72 patients who were examined, 4 were severely injured and 68 were mildly injured. The accident occurred in the order of Sedan 13 (41.9%), SUV 11 (35.5%), Truck 4 (12.9%), Van 2 (6.5%) and Bus 1 (3.2%). The median value of the age [lower quartile and upper quartile] was 43 [34.5–52] years old and the patients included 25 drivers, 11 passengers, 7 back seat passengers, and 29 bus passengers.
Conclusion
The primary cause of this mass collision accident was road surface freezing, but the more serious secondary cause was a driver’s inability to avoid the accident scene after the first collision. The severely injured occupants were occurred on the roads outside and inside the vehicle. In the event of a disaster, various teams from the police team, firefighting team, DMAT, EMS, road management team are gathered, and communication and command system between each team is important in order to identify and solve the disaster situation. To do this, it is important to develop manuals and prepare for training through repeated simulations.}

Ignoring such correlation may result in limited and biased conclusions and inefficient countermeasures. Recently, the availability of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) provides us an opportunity to collect individual vehicle’s data to conduct traffic analysis at the microscopic level. Hence, this paper contributes to the literature by proposing a new framework to analyze crash risk at freeway interchange merging areas considering drivers’ merging behavior. The analysis framework is conducted based on individual vehicle data from UAV videos. A multilevel random parameters logistic regression model is proposed to investigate each driver’s merging behavior in the acceleration lane. The model could identify the impact of different factors related to traffic and drivers on the merging behavior. Then, the crash risk between the merging vehicle and surrounding vehicles is calculated by incorporating the time-to-collision (TTC) and the output of the estimated merging behavior’s model. The results suggest that the proposed method provides more valuable insights about the crash risk at interchange merging areas by simultaneously considering the merging behavior and the safety measure. It is concluded that the merging speed, driving ability (e.g., lane change confidence, lane-keeping instability), and the merging location can affect the crash risk. These results can help traffic engineers propose efficient countermeasures to enhance the safety of the interchange merging area. The results also have implications to the design of merging areas and the advent of connected vehicles’ technology.}

The review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO 2017: CRD42017075704). The primary outcomes measured were crash or near-crash rates and the secondary outcomes were driving violations (including speeding and texting while driving) and driving performance (i.e., errors in driving simulator, etc.). This review was registered with PROSPERO 2017: CRD42017075704. A systematic search of databases from the disciplines of public health, psychology and transport safety (Ovid Cochrane Library, Ovid PsycINFO, Ovid EMBASE, CINAHL PLUS, Ovid TRANSPORT and TRID: TRIS and ITRD database) was conducted on February 7th 2018. Seventeen studies (12 cross-sectional and 5 case-control) published between 2011 and 2017 met the inclusion criteria. These all focused on the association between mindfulness or mind-wandering on road safety measures including driving performance (vehicle control, reaction time), compliance with speed zones and traffic signals, near-crash and crash rates, as well as propensity to engage in distracted driving behaviours. The results of the review suggest that mindfulness may be particularly useful for preventing distracted driving. However, a number of limitations in the existing research are noted. It is clear that more research is warranted to specifically investigate the effectiveness of mindfulness as an intervention for reducing road trauma.}

This study proposes the application of optimisation techniques less dependent on complex data sets in order to develop a quantitative framework to assess the impacts of disruptive events on liner shipping networks. We provide a categorization of liner network perturbations, differentiating between systemic and external and formulate a container assignment model that minimises routing costs extending previous implementations to allow feasible solutions when routing capacity is reduced below transport demand. We develop a base case network for the Southeast Asia to Europe liner shipping trade and review of accidents related to port disruptions for two scenarios of seismic and political conflict hazards. Numerical results identify alternative routing paths and costs in the aftermath of port disruptions scenarios and suggest higher vulnerability of intra-regional connectivity.}

Based on a rich data set eliciting both private and public WTP the results show that private WTP exceeds public WTP.

The safety indexes consist of Safety Evaluation Index (SEI) and Safety Warning Index (SWI), and are derived from the proposed risk criteria of Chinese vessel traffic. As a case study, data on vessel traffic accidents reported in the Western Shenzhen Port, South China from 1995 to 2015 are analyzed. The actual risk level of this area during the period is calculated under the framework. The implementation of the safety indexes indicate that the risk criteria and safety indexes are practicable and effective for the vessel traffic management. The methodology based on long-term accident data can significantly support the risk analysis in the macroscopic perspective for busy ports and waterways, such that SWI can act as threshold to trigger actions, while SEI can act as an indicator to measure safety status.}

However, these models do not account for all horizontal curve design criteria or consider several cases such as driving in adverse weather conditions or on pavement of low available friction. This paper develops a probabilistic, safety explicit approach of horizontal curve design using reliability analysis of four design criteria: vehicle stability, driver comfort, sight distance, and vehicle rollover. Two situations were considered in the analysis: driving in clear weather (dry pavement) and raining weather (wet pavement) to develop safety performance functions for annual and five-year collision frequency. Four types of regression models, Poisson, negative binomial, zero-inflated Poisson, and zero-inflated negative binomial, were used in the analysis. The AIC, BIC, and Vuong test were used in evaluating the developed models.}

abstract = {Single-motorcycle crashes are overrepresented on horizontally curved segments of rural, two-lane, undivided (RTU) highways. However, the relationship between single-motorcycle crash risk and the design features of horizontal curves on RTU highways is not well-studied in existing literature. This study aims to quantify the effect of horizontal curve type and radius on the risk of single-motorcycle crashes with a matched case-control study that can address the issues of the low sample mean, aggregation bias, and uncontrolled confounders existing in the traditional cross-sectional study. In the matched case-control study, three matching factors—year, annual average daily traffic (AADT), and segment length—were selected to match controls (RTU segments without crash records) with cases (RTU segments with crash records). A total of 1601 cases and 16,010 matched controls over 11 years (2005–2015) were identified as matched-strata. A conditional logistic model was fitted on the matched-strata data to estimate the crash modification factors (CMFs) of horizontal curve design features for single-motorcycle crashes. The modeling results highlighted the interaction effects between curve type and radius on the risk of single-motorcycle crashes. Sharp (radius ≤ 1500 ft) non-reverse curves were identified as the riskiest curve design for motorcyclists, followed by sharp reverse curves and moderate (1500 ft < radius ≤ 3000 ft) reverse curves. The study also revealed that motorcyclists might take safety-compensation behaviors on sharp curves, narrow shoulders, and poor pavement conditions. Engineering and education countermeasures are suggested for comprehending curve presence and associated risk level, reducing curve entry speed, and improving safety awareness. Finally, the limitations of the study and possible solutions are discussed.}

abstract = {There is a body of research on how driver behaviour might change in response to bicyclists’ appearance. In 2007, Walker published a study suggesting motorists drove closer on average when passing a bicyclist if the rider wore a helmet, potentially increasing the risk of a collision. Olivier and Walter re-analysed the same data in 2013 and claimed helmet wearing was not associated with close vehicle passing. Here we show how Olivier and Walter’s analysis addressed a subtly, but importantly, different question than Walker’s. Their conclusion was based on omitting information about variability in driver behaviour and instead dividing overtakes into two binary categories of ‘close’ and ‘not close’; we demonstrate that they did not justify or address the implications of this choice, did not have sufficient statistical power for their approach, and moreover show that slightly adjusting their definition of ‘close’ would reverse their conclusions. We then present a new analysis of the original dataset, measuring directly the extent to which drivers changed their behaviour in response to helmet wearing. This analysis confirms that drivers did, overall, get closer when the rider wore a helmet. The distribution of overtaking events shifted just over one-fifth of a standard deviation closer to the rider – a potentially important behaviour if, as theoretical frameworks suggest, near-misses and collisions lie on a continuum. The paper ends by considering wider issues surrounding this topic and suggests public health research might be best served by shifting focus to risk elimination rather than harm mitigation.}

In this paper, we propose a crash prediction method based on a bivariate extreme value theory (EVT) framework, considering both drivers’ perception-reaction failure and failure to proper evasive actions. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was utilized to collect videos of ten intersections in Fengxian, China, at representative time periods. High-resolution vehicle trajectory data were extracted by a Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) technique, based on four detailed metrics were derived including Time-to-accident (TA), Post-encroachment Time (PET), minimum Time-to-collision (mTTC), and Maximum Deceleration Rate (MaxD). TA was expected to capture the chance of perception-reaction failure, while other three metrics were used to measure the probability of failure to proper evasive actions. Univariate EVT models were applied to obtain marginal crash probability based on each metric. Bivariate EVT models were developed to obtain joint crash probability based on three pairs: TA and mTTC, TA and PET, and TA and MaxD. Thus, union crash probability within observation periods can be derived and the annual crash frequency of each intersection was predicted. The predictions were compared to actual annual crash frequencies, using multiple tests. The findings are three-folds: 1. The best conflict metrics for angle and rear-end crash predictions were different; 2. Bivariate EVT models were found to be superior to univariate models, regarding both angle and rear-end crash predictions; 3. TA appeared to be an important conflict metric that should be considered in a bivariate EVT model framework. In general, the proposed method can be considered as a promising tool for safety evaluation, when crash data are limited.}

abstract = {The saturation of mobile phones throughout Australia has led to some individuals being unable to regulate their use within situations that are inappropriate or risky. One of the most prevalent risky mobile phone use behaviours is texting while driving. Attempts to explain texting while driving suggest cognitive variables and personality characteristics are key factors. This study explored relationships between trait self-regulation, habitual text messaging, trait mindfulness, and texting while driving. One hundred and seventy participants comprising Australian undergraduate psychology students and members of the public completed an online survey measuring trait self-regulation, habitual text messaging behaviour, trait mindfulness, and frequency of texting while driving. It was found that habitual texting behaviour mediated the relationship between trait self-regulation and frequency of texting while driving. Additionally, trait mindfulness moderated the relationship between habit and texting while driving, such that habitual texting was significantly, positively related to texting while driving, but only for individuals with low to moderate trait mindfulness. These results suggest personality constructs related to attention, awareness, and control of behaviour play a significant role in counteracting the association that habitual texting behaviour has with the frequency of texting while driving. As these traits are considered malleable, this association may be applicable in future development of intervention programs aimed at increasing control over mobile phone use and reducing the frequency with which people text while driving.}

In evaluating TSP systems, more attention has been given to its operational effects than to its safety effects. Existing studies assessing TSP’s safety effects reported mixed results, indicating that the safety effects of TSP vary in different contexts. In this study, TSP implementations in Portland, Oregon, were assessed using interrupted time series analysis (ITSA) on month-to-month changes in number of crashes from January 1995 to December 2010. Single-group and controlled ITSA were conducted for all crashes, property-damage-only crashes, fatal and injury crashes, pedestrian-involved crashes, and bike-involved crashes. Evaluation of the post-intervention period (2003–2010) showed a reduction in all crashes on street sections with TSP (-4.5%), comparing with the counterfactual estimations based on the control group data. The reduction in property-damage-only crashes (-10.0%) contributed the most to the overall reduction. Fatal and injury crashes leveled out after TSP implementation but did not change significantly comparing with the control group. Pedestrian and bike-involved crashes were found to increase in the post-intervention period with TSP, comparing with the control group. Potential reasons to these TSP effects on traffic safety were discussed.}

abstract = {Objective
Several parking assistance systems are available to help drivers back up. Rear cross-traffic alert warns drivers when they are reversing and cross-traffic approaches the rear of their vehicle, as might happen when backing out of a perpendicular parking space in a lot. The goal of this study was to examine the effect of rear cross-traffic alert on backing crashes.
Methods
Negative binomial regression was used to compare police-reported backing crash rates in 25 U.S. states per insured vehicle year between General Motors and Mazda vehicles with rear cross-traffic alert and the same vehicle models without the optional system, controlling for the presence of other parking assistance systems and additional factors that may affect crash risk.
Results
Crash involvement rates in backing crashes overall were 22% lower among vehicles with rear cross-traffic alert than among vehicles without the system when averaged between the two manufacturers. Rates were 32% lower among vehicles with the system than without in two-vehicle backing crashes where the vehicles were traveling in perpendicular directions. Both reductions were statistically significant.
Conclusions
Rearview cameras and rear automatic braking, which are designed to help drivers detect and brake for obstacles directly behind the vehicle, have been shown in previous research to be effective in reducing backing crashes reported to the police. Rear cross-traffic alert can complement these systems by preventing potential backing crashes that other parking assistance systems are not designed to detect. Manufacturers should equip vehicles with rear cross-traffic alert, in addition to other parking assistance systems like rear automatic braking, to maximize the number of backing crashes prevented.}

Previous research indicates that the effectiveness of bicycle lanes differs according to roadway characteristics, and that bicycle lane types are differentially associated with reduced crash risks. The aim of this study is to combine these perspectives and identify the types of on-road bicycle lanes that are associated with the greatest reductions in bicycle crashes given the presence of specific roadway characteristics. We compiled a cross sectional spatial dataset consisting of 32,444 intersection polygons and 57,285 street segment polygons representing the roadway network for inner Melbourne, Australia. The dependent measure was a dichotomous indicator for any bicycle crash (2014–2017). Independent measures were bicycle lanes (exclusive bicycle lanes, shared bicycle and parking lanes, marked wide kerbside lanes, and kerbside bicycle lanes) and other roadway characteristics (speed limit, bus routes, tram routes, bridges, one-way flow, traffic lane width). In Bayesian conditional autoregressive logit models, bicycle lanes of all types were associated with decreased crash odds where speeds were greater, bus routes and tram stops were present, and traffic lanes were narrower. Only exclusive bicycle lanes were associated with reduced crash odds (compared to the expected odds given the presence of the bicycle lane and the roadway conditions) in all these setting. The extent to which on-road bicycle lanes reduce crash risks depends on the bicycle lane type, the roadway conditions, and the combination of these two factors. Bicycle lanes that provide greater separation between cyclists and vehicular traffic are most consistently protective.}

With regard to the highest class (Interstates), the results suggest that, compared to no-casualty accidents, casualty accidents are more sensitive to traffic volume and average vertical grade, but less sensitive to the inside shoulder width and the median width. For US Roads, it was determined that, compared to no-casualty accidents, casualty accidents are more sensitive to traffic volume, outside shoulder width, pavement condition, and median width but less sensitive to the average vertical grade. For the relatively lowest-class roads (State Roads), it was determined that, compared to no-casualty accidents, casualty accidents are more sensitive to the traffic volume, lane width, outside shoulder width, and pavement condition. Compared to the relatively lower-class highways, accidents at higher-class highways are more sensitive to: changes in traffic volume, average vertical grade, median width, inside shoulder width, and the pavement condition (no-casualty accidents only); but less sensitive to changes in lane width, pavement condition (casualty accidents only), and the outside shoulder width. This variation in sensitivity across the different road classes could be attributed to the differences in road geometry standards across the road classes, as the results seem to support the hypothesis that these standards strongly influence accident occurrence. It is hoped that the developed bivariate negative binomial models can help highway engineers to evaluate their current design standards and policy, and to assess the safety consequences of changes in these standards in each road class.}

Visual, vibrotactile, and auditory modalities were varied in the design of the experiment under four conditions: no-task, phone conversation, smartphone interaction, and video watching tasks. Driving simulator experiments were conducted to analyze the drivers’ take-over performance by collecting data during the transition time of re-engaging control of the vehicle, the time taken to be on the loop, and time taken to be physically ready to drive. Data were gathered on the perceived usefulness, safety, satisfaction, and effectiveness for each TOR based on a self-reported questionnaire. Takeover and hands-on times varied considerably, as shown by high standard deviation values between modalities, especially for phone conversations and smartphone interaction tasks. Moreover, it was found that participants failed to take over control of the vehicle when they were given visual TORs for phone conversation and smartphone interaction tasks. The perceived safety and satisfaction varied for the NDR task. Results from the statistical analysis showed that the NDR task significantly influenced the takeover time, but there was no significant interaction effect between the TOR modalities and the NDR task. The results could potentially be applied to the design of safe and efficient transitions of highly controlled, automated driving, where drivers are enabled to engage in NDR tasks.}

This parameter is of unclear policy relevance, and is frequently misinterpreted as an estimate of the increased crash risk, a practice that introduces a substantial “interpretational bias”. Methods: A Bayesian statistical model for culpability study counts is developed to provide inference for both culpable and total crash risks, with a hierarchical effect specification to allow for meta-analysis across studies with potentially heterogeneous risk parameter values. The model is assessed in a bootstrap study and applied to data from 13 published culpability studies. Results: The model outperforms the culpability OR in bootstrap analyses. Used on actual study data, the average increase in crash risk is estimated at 1.28 (1.16–1.40). The pooled increased risk of a culpable crash is estimated as 1.42 (95% credibility interval 1.11–1.75), which is similar to pooled estimates using traditional ORs (1.46, 95% CI: 1.24–1.72). The attributable risk fraction of cannabis impaired driving is estimated to lie below 2% for all but two of the included studies. Conclusions: Culpability ORs exaggerate risk increases and parameter uncertainty when misinterpreted as total crash ORs. The increased crash risk associated with THC-positive drivers in culpability studies is low.}

abstract = {The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of passenger cars’ first year of registration, weight, and age on the number of killed or seriously injured (KSI) car drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists. Poisson regression models were developed of injury crashes involving passenger cars in Norway in 2000–2016, with the following predictor variables: The cars’ first year of registration and weight, either crash year or car age, the drivers age and gender, and in models for car-car collisions the crash partner cars’ weight and either registration year or age. The results show that there are fewer KSI car drivers in more recent, newer, and heavier cars. It is estimated that the number of KSI car drivers in all types of crashes on average decreases by 6.7% for each consecutive registration year (-7.2% in car-car collisions and -6.0% in single vehicle crashes), increases by 3.7% for each consecutive year of age (+2.1% in car-car collisions and +5.3% in single vehicle crashes), and decreases by 4.9% on average for each 100 kg weight increase (-11.1% in car-car collisions and -2.3% in single vehicle crashes). In car-car collisions there are fewer KSI car drivers when the crash partner car is more recent (-4.4% for each consecutive registration year), and more KSI car drivers when the crash partner car is older (+4.1% for each consecutive year of age), or heavier (+6.8% per 100 kg weight increase). In collisions with pedestrians or cyclists, there are fewer KSI pedestrians/cyclists when the car is more recent (-3.3% per consecutive registration year) and more KSI pedestrians/cyclists when the car is heavier (+4.6% per 100 kg weight increase). Due to the large effects of safety improvements in more recent cars, an increased renewal rate in the passenger car fleet can be expected to contribute to large safety improvements. The increasing weight of more recent cars may contribute to improved safety for those who drive heavier cars, but overall the effect of increasing weight is probably small or even negative because heavier vehicles impose greater risk on other car drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists.}

In particular, kinematic data related to accidents (impact velocity, velocity change of the vehicles, etc.) make possible the identification of correlations between impact severity and injury risk (IR), as well as assessing the effectiveness of vehicle protection systems. The necessary condition to conduct suitable and significant analyses is to utilise data which are correct and representative of national statistics, i.e., congruent with physical laws governing the accident phenomena. Whereas representativeness can generally be retrospectively verified, the checks on kinematic data coherence during codification are rarely performed. The present work describes a procedure to verify the internal coherence of kinematic data collected in in-depth accident databases. The introduced checks allow the identification of parameters, which are not internally coherent because the accident reconstruction model employed is inappropriate or improperly used. These checks pertain to physical laws on which road accident reconstruction is based, i.e., momentum conservation, compatibility of velocity triangles, and energy conservation. Moreover, they can be modified and expanded to consider other parameters, making the methodology virtually applicable to any database. In the case of vehicle-to-vehicle collisions, the application of the procedure to detect incongruent data inside two real databases demonstrates how their number is often not negligible. Furthermore, consequences can be substantial for both direct and secondary analysis, i.e., determining IR curves (for example, logistic regression on input data) and identifying IR associated to an accident. Accordingly, the application of checks is particularly recommended during both analysis and collection phases to confirm the congruence of collected data; consequently, the quality of investigation is enhanced.}

abstract = {Interstate 80 in Wyoming is one of the busiest freight corridors that is characterized with harsh winter conditions and challenging mountainous roadway sections. The fatality rates in Wyoming are always typically higher than the national level. The 402-mile I-80 corridor in Wyoming was selected by the USDOT FHWA for piloting connected vehicle technology to improve the safety and mobility of heavy trucks. To accurately quantify the effectiveness of the pilot, evaluation of the pre-deployment safety performance is essential. Unlike other studies, the full 402-mile of I-80 corridor passing through Wyoming was investigated as a requirement of the USDOT. Homogeneous segmentation was used to divide the corridor based on horizontal and vertical roadway characteristics. A transferability analysis was conducted to investigate whether a short portion of the corridor would be representative of the whole 402-miles of I-80. Results showed that the whole 402 miles should be considered in the analysis due to the radical changes throughout the corridor. Several SPFs were developed using three models; negative binomial (NB) model, spatial autoregressive (SAR) model, and non-parametric multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). Comparisons were performed for the developed models. Crash prediction models for total crashes and Fatal and Injury (F + I) crashes in addition to truck crashes were calibrated utilizing five years of crash data from 2012 to 2016. The results obtained from the three statistical approaches showed that MARS model provided a better model fit compared to NB and SAR models, given the lower AIC values for the developed models. Yet, SAR models showed the significant spatial dependency between the neighbor roadway segments. Additionally, the NB model showed its superiority on SAR when the spatial correlation was not significant. Parametric and non-parametric techniques should be interchangeably used in developing SPFs according to the modeling needs.}

A cross-sectional analysis using Generalized Linear Model (GLM) approach with Zero Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) distribution was adopted to develop the relevant regression models in this study. Lane width, speed limit, and grass in the median were observed to have positive impacts on reducing bicycle crashes. On the contrary, presence of sidewalk and sidewalk barrier were found to increase the bicycle crash probabilities. Increased bicycle activity was found to reduce the bicycle crash probabilities on segments, while increased bicycle activity resulted in higher bicycle crash probabilities at intersections. Bus stops were found to increase the bicycle crash probabilities at intersections, whereas, protected signal control had a positive impact on bicycle safety. This research provides a greater insight into how various characteristics affect bicycle safety, a topic that is seldom considered by researchers and practitioners.}

abstract = {Behavioural observation studies in road safety research collect naturalistic data of road users that are not informed (beforehand) of their participation in a research project. It enables the observation of behavioural and situational processes that contribute to unsafe traffic events, while possible behavioural adaptations due to the road users’ recognition of being observed are minimized. The literature in this field is vast and diverse, with studies dating back to the 1930s. The aim of this paper is to summarize the research efforts in the domain of road user behavioural observation research to examine trends and developments of this type of research, using a scoping review. After the definition of certain selection criteria, 600 journal articles found in three major online databases were retrieved and included in this review. The number of publications regarding road user behavioural observation studies has increased rapidly during recent years, indicating the importance of behavioural observation studies to study traffic safety. Most studies collected data on car drivers (81%), while vulnerable road users have been observed in 32% of all studies, with pedestrians and (motor)cyclists as the most common road user types. The results showed that the main goal of behavioural observation is to monitor (51%), followed by the evaluation of a specific safety improving measure (38%) and the development of behavioural models (10%). Most topics relate to traffic events where interactions with other road users are necessary, indicating that the examination of behavioural processes underlying single-vehicle crashes has received little attention. The ongoing developments of automated video analysis software tools can be the next methodological step forward in video-based behavioural observation studies, since it enables a more objective data collection and data analysis process.}

The various conﬂict indicators have been shown in earlier studies to be of different and sometimes independent nature. Therefore, there is a need to combine different indicators to gain better understanding of the underlying severity of traffic events and for more reliable safety analysis. This study proposes a bivariate extreme value model to integrate different traffic conflict indicators for road safety estimation, and the model is validated with actual crash data. Based on video data collected from four signalized intersections in two Canadian cities, computer vision techniques were utilized to identify rear-end traffic conflicts using several indicators. The conflict indicators included: time to collision (TTC), modified time to collision (MTTC), post encroachment time (PET), and deceleration to avoid crash (DRAC). Then bivariate extreme value models were developed for combinations of each two indicators, and the numbers of crashes were estimated from the models and compared to the observed crashes. The results show that most of the estimated crashes are in the range of 95% Poisson confidence interval of observed crashes, which indicates that the bivariate extreme value model is a promising tool for road safety estimation. Moreover, the accuracy of estimated crashes are different for different indicator combinations. The results show that the estimates of TTC\&PET are the most accurate, followed by TTC\&MTTC, TTC\&DRAC, PET\&MTTC, PET\&DRAC and MTTC\&DRAC. A further correlation analysis suggests that a combination of two independent conflict indicators leads to better crash estimation performance.}

Five hundred and sixty Canadian older drivers (males = 61.3%) from the Candrive/Ozcandrive longitudinal study completed the DBQ yearly for four years across five time-points that were approximately 12 months apart. In Year 1, the average age of the older drivers was 76.0 years (SD = 4.5 years; Range = 70–92 years). Findings from the study support the 21-item, three-factor DBQ structure suggested by Koppel and colleagues for an Australian sample of older drivers as being acceptable in an independent sample of Canadian older drivers. In addition, Canadian older drivers’ responses to this version of the DBQ were stable across the five time-points. More specifically, there was very little change in older drivers’ self-reported violations, and no significant change for self-reported errors or lapses. The findings from the current study add further support for this version of the DBQ as being a suitable tool for examining self-reported aberrant driving behaviours in older drivers. Future research should investigate the relationship between older drivers’ self-reported aberrant driving behaviours and their performance on functional measures, their responses to other driving-related abilities and practice scales and/or questionnaires, as well their usual (or naturalistic) driving practices and/or performance on on-road driving tasks.}

This is used as a starting point for addressing risk quantification and safety for vehicles that can control speed. The effect of excess speed on the risk of accidents is estimated with a real telematics data set. Scenarios for a reduction of speed limit violations and the consequent decrease in the expected number of accident claims are shown. If excess speed could be eliminated, then the expected number of accident claims could be reduced to half of its initial value, applying the average conditions of the data used in this study.

However, the key factors that distinguish high/low fatigue-related accident risk (FRAR) taxi drivers are uncertain. By examining a series of potential factors related with fatigue or accident risk as discussed in previous research, the objective was to find out the most important factors that relate to taxi driver’s FRAR, and to investigate the association of these factors and taxi driver’s FRAR. Modeling methods were applied to questionnaire data collected from Beijing taxi drivers. A 269-sample dataset was analyzed to identify key factors related to FRAR and to fit FRAR prediction models. The model’s performance on high-risk driver prediction was then tested using another independently collected 100-sample dataset. High-risk taxi drivers had significantly longer driving hours per working day, lower rest ratios, less driving experience, and were more confident about their fatigue resistance. The FRAR model with only four major measurable predictors achieved a sensitivity of 91.9% and a specificity of 94.6% on predicting labeled data. Adjusting drive-rest habits and self-evaluation pertaining to these predictors is good for high-risk drivers to mitigate their accident risk. It was concluded that taxi drivers’ drive-rest habits, experience, and intention for fatigue driving are crucial, and to a large degree determine their FRAR, and the prediction model can satisfactorily identify high-risk taxi drivers.}

In this sense, interpersonal violence (IV), psychiatric comorbidity and impulsivity seem to play an important role in DUI engagement according to previous studies. There are, however, limited data originated from low and middle income countries. In the present study, drug-using Brazilian drivers reporting DUI (n = 75) presented a higher prevalence of bipolar disorders (BD; DUI: 8% vs. non-DUI: 0%, p < 0.001), lower prevalence of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; DUI: 0% vs. non-DUI: 12.6%, p < 0.001), and higher prevalence of childhood trauma (DUI: 65.3% vs. non-DUI: 46.8%, p = 0.022) than those not reporting DUI (n = 79). The evaluation of impulsivity though the Barratt Impulsivity Scale, which give impulsivity scores ranging from 30 to 120, showed higher impulsivity scores in the DUI group (80.4 ± 8) than in the non-DUI group (77.2 ± 10, p = 0.045). In general, subjects were young adults (mean age of 36 ± 9 years), Caucasians (58.4%), not married (61.0%), and with elementary schooling (40.3%) with no significant differences in demographic characteristics between drivers with and without DUI behavior. A multiple Poisson regression model showed that individuals reporting IV as perpetrators and history of childhood trauma were more likely to report DUI (PR: 1.66, 95%CI 1.22–2.7; PR: 1.57, 95%CI 1.02–2.42, respectively). The overlapping of violent situations (childhood trauma, IV and DUI) in some individuals presented here corroborates literature data suggesting that DUI can be an externalizing expression of a range of risky behavior, such as impulsiveness and aggressiveness. Moreover, while BD and higher impulsivity scores seem to act as risk factors for DUI, OCD was shown as a protective factor. These results corroborate the hypothesis that individuals with high risk for DUI could probably be identified by multidimensional assessment of cognitive, risky taking, and personality traits, which perhaps could facilitate the development of focused interventions.}

This process needs to estimate expected benefits (reduction in average crash frequency) and costs of projects. Due to variances of crash modification factor (CMF), crash frequency and cost of projects, prediction of costs and benefits would be accompanied by uncertainty and it can subsequently lead to a wrong decision making. To deal with the inherent uncertainty in the decision making process, this paper presents a ranking approach based on integration of Data Envelopment Analysis and Monte-Carlo simulation. A Monte-Carlo simulation is applied to generate stochastic values as input and outputs of the problem instead of running DEA model just for deterministic case. Data from an existing case study is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology. Numerical results indicate that DEA results are very sensitive to data uncertainty and uncertainties can have great influence in ranking results of road safety improvement projects especially when both input and output data are uncertain. It also indicates that how the proposed methodology can be useful for detecting sensitive decision-making units and providing a more comprehensive view for decision makers to allocate a limit budget to the most efficient safety improvement projects.}

Those few studies have not yet measured the relationship between vessel speed and accidents by using real accident data. To fill this gap in the literature, this study estimates the impact of vessel speed reduction on vessel damages, casualties and frequency of vessel accidents. Accidents in RSZ ports were compared to non-RSZ ports by using U.S. Coast Guard data to capture the speed reduction effects. The results show that speed reduction influenced accident frequency as a result of two factors, the fuel price and the RSZ designation. Every $10 increase in the fuel price led to a 10.3% decrease in the number of accidents, and the RSZ designation reduced vessel accidents by 47.9%. However, the results do not clarify the exact impact of speed reduction on accident casualty.}

The results show that pedestrians’ estimations of waiting time decreased with decreasing tempo in the audible signal, but did not differ significantly across different pitches.

The tempo can still predict pedestrians’ time estimation. The findings have implications for auditory signal design of traffic lights.}

The approach used in data collection or some assumptions made in the analysis methodology might lead to inaccurate results. For example, manual data collection, equipment limitations, and field experiments involving monitoring driving behavior for a specific region for a short-term are potential sources of errors in data collection. This paper aims at overcoming some of these issues in developing models to evaluate safety performance of horizontal curves and predict the curve collision frequency. The developed models relate expected collision frequency on horizontal curves to the speed reduction from the approach tangent to the curve, which is commonly used as a major geometric design consistency measure. The methodology to achieve this objective included three tasks; data collection, evaluating and modeling the viable speed reduction parameters, and developing safety performance models to estimate collision frequency on horizontal curves. Individual drivers’ trips on 49 horizontal curves on rural two-lane highways in rolling and mountainous terrains in Washington State were extracted from the Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) database. Models were developed to relate different speed reduction parameters to curve characteristics. These models were then applied to 1430 horizontal curves in Washington State to estimate the speed reduction parameters and relate them to collision frequency. Several safety performance models were developed which show that speed reduction, as a design consistency measure, is directly related to collision frequency on horizontal curves. Furthermore, the speed reduction parameters are more significant variables in predicting collision frequency than all curve geometric parameters.}

Road accidents are often caused by an accumulation of factors; however, drivers appear to be by far the most decisive one. The driver’s behaviour is complex and depends on reflex (or involuntary) and voluntary driving actions. The first class of actions (reflex actions) are typical human reactions that remain inaccessible to awareness and refer to the direct interaction between the road user and the characteristics of the road and its surrounding environment. Conversely, voluntary actions are conscious behaviours adopted on the basis of planned decisions. Both types of driving actions act simultaneously and the interaction between them and their relative effects on road safety are an aspect not yet well examined. The main objective of this study was to provide, by means of a driving simulation experiment, an insight on this interaction by evaluating the influence of some psychological characteristics on the effectiveness of different types of traffic calming measures at pedestrian crossings, designed according to the Human Factors principles. Fifty-eight participants drove a virtual urban route while data on their performance, as they approached five configurations of pedestrian crossings equipped with different physical and perceptual treatments, were collected. The participants were preliminarily characterized by means of two psychological questionnaires, which allowed the identification of three distinct groups of drivers belonging to three risk profiles (careful, worried, and at risk). The three groups of drivers reacted differently to the proposed engineering treatments, confirming the clustering identified by the preliminary analysis. The results showed that the proposed traffic calming measures are effective on all psychological sub-groups of drivers, with different effectiveness. These first results support that, in the considered driving environment (pedestrian crossings), the Human Factors approach, with which traffic calming measures can be arranged, could be effective, even if different psychological sub-groups are differently affected.}

The results show that individual discomfort awareness varies between drivers. More importantly, the potential patterns of situational discomfort grading are extracted, which provides knowledge for characterizing drivers in the context of discomfort awareness.

Vendors who had promising safety technologies, focused in the commercial vehicle domain, were solicited to participate and submit an application. One technology was selected by FMCSA for each evaluation cycle (lasting approximately 18 months). The technology was tested in both static and dynamic conditions, after which a trucking fleet, and its drivers, were brought in to test the technology in a field operational test (FOT) lasting approximately 6 weeks. During the FOT, 15–20 trucks were instrumented with the technology and other data collection equipment, including sensors and video cameras. A study was then conducted during which drivers used the technology in their revenue-producing operations. Initially, often for the first 2 months, the technology collected data but did but not actively present alerts to the driver. Following this baseline period, a four-month intervention period was conducted. Each evaluation has resulted in more than 1,000,000 km of driving data including continuous video data. Data analyses focused on understanding the efficacy of the technology in terms of (i) safety improvements, (ii) challenges to implementation (e.g., unintended consequences), and (iii) user acceptance (including driver, fleet manager, and other fleet personnel as appropriate). The technology vendors who applied for the first three evaluations can be classified into the following general categories: fatigue/drowsiness, fleet management, visibility safety systems, cell phone policy/enforcement, and other systems. Three technology evaluations were completed in the first 5 years of (i) a blind spot detection and warning system, (ii) an onboard monitoring system, and (iii) a novel mirror technology. High-level results of each of these three evaluations are highlighted in the paper.}

abstract = {The roadway safety management process plays an important role in the national efforts for improving road safety along the Italian freeway network. In 2016, 8.3% of the overall Italian road deaths and 6.3% of the overall road injuries occurred along the 6700 km-long freeway network. Accident Prediction Models (APMs) represent one of the best tools to perform a road safety quantitative assessment. With the aim of providing the Italian freeway agencies with a tool that allows to deal with potential safety issues, this paper defines two APMs for single- and multiple-vehicle fatal-and-injury crashes to be applied on Italian rural freeway segments, based on jurisdictional specific Safety Performance Functions (SPFs) developed in the PRACT project. The proposed procedure is based on the Highway Safety Manual (HSM) approach, and it introduces a new methodology to transfer the HSM to European motorways. In order to improve the prediction accuracy, the proposed APMs consist in a jurisdictional specific base SPF, developed for the base data set as a function of Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) and segment length, combined with Crash Modification Factors (CMFs), in order to account for differences between each site and the base conditions. The full models are then calibrated based on the total number of accidents observed in the wide data set. For both full models (one for single-vehicle and one for multiple-vehicle crashes), the goodness of fit is evaluated in terms of chi square test, root mean square error, observed Vs predicted diagram and predicted Vs residual diagram. The results show a good aptitude of both models to describe the analysis data set. The proposed models represent a solid and reliable tool for practitioners to perform accident predictions along the Italian freeway network.}

abstract = {Because current automated vehicles have operational limitations, it is important to ensure that the fallback-ready driver is able to perform appropriately when required to take over control of the vehicle. However, time-related increase in driver drowsiness is well-known, and drowsy driving can affect response to take-over request (TOR). It was previously reported that a scheduled period of manual driving during automated driving was beneficial in maintaining driver arousal level. The present driving simulator study investigates the effects of scheduled manual driving on driver drowsiness and performance, as well as age differences therein. A total of 115 participants, whose gender was balanced and age was distributed uniformly from 20 to 70 years, drove an automated vehicle for 31 min, and a TOR was prompted before a collision event. A between-subjects design comprised two conditions: with versus without a scheduled 10-min interval of manual driving that ended 10 min before TOR. The Karolinska Sleepiness Scale and eyeblink durations estimated from electrooculograms (EOG) were used to subjectively and objectively measure participant’s drowsiness. Reaction time, standard deviation of steering wheel angle, and minimum Time-to-Collison (TTC) were extracted to measure driver performance in response to TOR. The alleviating effect on drowsiness of 10-min scheduled manual driving became non-significant after another 10-min period of automated driving. Although the scheduled manual driving had no significant effect for younger drivers, older drivers reacted significantly more slowly in both steering and braking at the critical event. These findings provide essential insights for human-vehicle interactions: Scheduled manual driving cannot maintain drivers’ arousal level for 10 min afterwards, and for older drivers, it would be better to avoid unnecessary task-switching between manual and automated driving.}

abstract = {Pedestrians are the most vulnerable users of the highway transportation system. While encouraging “Green Transportation”, a concerning fact emerges in the United States: pedestrian deaths are climbing faster than motorist fatalities, reaching nearly 6000 in 2016 - the highest in over two decades. In 2015, pedestrian fatalities reached 110, 14.6% of total traffic fatalities in Louisiana for that year. Consequently, the Louisiana pedestrian fatality rate (fatalities per 100,000 population) was 2.18, exceeding the U.S. average of 1.67. In an effort to effectively reduce the pedestrian crashes, this paper investigates this problem for Louisiana. However, with the heterogeneity of provided crash data, it is difficult to identify major causation that contribute to these crashes. This study will reveal the findings of the Latent Class Cluster (LCC) model, utilizing it as a preliminary tool for the segmentation of 14,236 pedestrian crashes in Louisiana, between the years of 2006–2015. Next, Multinomial Logit (MNL) models are used to identify the main factors in pedestrian crash severity, shown in the original dataset, by further analyzing the clusters previously obtained by the LCC model. The results shed lights on the crash characteristics that are not apparent without these combined data analysis methods. Certain variables that have not been identified as significant in whole data analysis are identified as significant for a specific cluster, such as pedestrian crossing and entering roads, crash hours between midnight to 6 pm, dark-unlighted conditions, dark-lighted conditions, and non-intersection locations. The study suggests that the LCC regression approach can reveal important, formerly hidden relationships in traffic safety analyses.}

This study tried to capture the effort of the reinstated offenders to increase the duration of their compliance in spite of their subsequent conviction for DUI. Specifically, the difference between the recidivism rate and the duration of compliance was examined and compared in terms of drivers’ characteristics, including gender, the type of license, and age. Data from all drivers who have been newly licensed for five years from 2009 to 2014 in Korea were collected for analysis. The proportional hazard regression and logistic regression models were estimated for the drivers with suspended or revoked licenses, respectively. The former was for exploring the duration of compliance, and the latter was for analyzing the recidivism rate. The results of the analysis showed that license sanctions significantly increased the duration of compliance. The results indicated that the violation-prone groups included male drivers, those with regular and moped licenses, and those between the ages of 30 and 39. License suspension was more effective than license revocation, but this finding did not hold for regular licensed drivers. Drivers’ groups that showed different results between compliance duration and recidivism rate also were identified and appropriate treatments should be implemented to improve their willingness to comply.}

The traffic resilience theory is introduced to learn safety problems from the standpoint of 1) considering safety critical events, such as traffic violations, as the safety disturbances, and 2) considering safety resilience as the ability of the traffic, greatly associated with traffic conditions, to resist critical events turning into crashes. The concept of safety resilience was illustrated qualitatively through simulation experiments. Aimsun microsimulation software was used to simulate traffic conditions with safety critical events (vehicle violations, in this paper) involved based on the geometric design of the G15 Expressway in Shanghai. Based on data from the simulation experiment, a two-staged model was developed which classifies crash risk status into three types including no-risk, low-risk and high-risk status. Modeling approach that relies on the back propagation neural network method was applied. The performance of the model in prediction was validated through the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve test. Results indicated that the model performed well in predicting crash risks in the simulated environment. After training the model, an extra simulation experiment involving six additional tests was conducted. Results show that the traffic resilience theory may work in explaining the relationship between traffic conditions, safety critical events and crash risk, which are the key elements in road safety field. The introduction of safety resilience may inspire further exploration on this topic in both research and practice. Meanwhile, the model can be used to predict and monitor risks on expressways in a potentially more precise way.}

While there has been significant research examining driver performance during a distraction, there has been less focus on how much time is required to recover performance following a distraction. To address this issue, participants in the current study completed a simulated 40-min drive while being presented with distractions. Distractions were followed by a visual Detection Response Task (DRT) to assess participants’ resource availability and potential capacity to respond to hazards, as well as continuous measures of driving performance including their ability to maintain a consistent speed and lane position. We examined recovery for a 40 s period following three types of distraction: cognitive only, cognitive + visual, and cognitive + visual + manual. Since safe driving requires cognitive, visual, and manual resources, we expected recovery to take longer when the distraction involved more of these resources. Consistent with this, each additional level of distraction further slowed DRT response times and increased speed variability during 0–10 s post-distraction. However, DRT accuracy was equally impaired for all conditions during 0–20 s post-distraction, while lane position maintenance from 0 to 10 s post-distraction was only impaired when the distraction included a manual component. In addition, while participants in all three conditions exhibited some degree of post-distraction impairment, only those in the cognitive + visual + manual condition reduced their speed during the time when distracted, suggesting drivers show limited awareness of the potential persistent consequences of distraction.}

Currently, the self-driving vehicles are programmed for conservative behavior, yielding to approaching pedestrians. Consequently, the future urban traffic will slow down significantly. In this paper, a conceptual model of vehicle–pedestrian negotiation is proposed. This model allows individual decision making of multiple vehicles and pedestrians, extending a prior negotiation model for a single vehicle and a single pedestrian. The possible negotiation opportunities for vehicles are modeled considering different risk-taking behaviors of pedestrians. Simulation results show an overall improvement in the waiting time of vehicles and thus in the intersection throughput, compared to conservative vehicle behavior. The simulation results show also that the benefit of reduced waiting times for vehicles comes at the cost of some waiting time for pedestrians. However, the observed pedestrian waiting times in this model are not more than the generally accepted waiting times reported in empirical studies.}

A methodology is presented to estimate the number of ‘unsafe’ passing events on 4-lane urban arterials with no on-street bike lanes. A ‘critical passing distance’ is defined to classify expected passing maneuvers i.e. when a motorized vehicle overtakes a bicycle, into ‘safe’ and ‘unsafe’ passing events. The proposed method enables calculation of the expected number of ‘unsafe passing’ events based on the expected bicycle demand, road segment’s length, AADT, speed limit, and traffic signal timing parameters. The ‘critical passing distance’ is an input parameter and can be set by the planner. Given the number of expected ‘unsafe passing’ events, and institutional safety objectives and standards in terms of acceptable risk levels for cyclists, transportation planning departments can use the proposed methodology to decide whether provision of a specific cycling facility is necessary for a given road segment.}

This study was designed to investigate the interaction effects of warning lead time (2.5 s vs. 4.5 s), warning reliability (73% vs. 89%), and speech warning style (command vs. notification) on driver performance and subjective evaluation of warnings in CVS. A driving simulator study with thirty-two participants was designed to simulate a connected vehicle environment with missed warnings due to failures in the communication network of the CVS. With regard to the response types, the results showed that notification warnings led to a lower probability of braking response and a higher probability of braking and steering response compared with command warnings. The results showed command warnings led to a smaller collision rate compared to notification warnings with the warning lead time of 2.5 s, whereas no significant difference of collision rates was found between two warning styles when the warning lead time is 4.5 s. These results suggest notification warnings should be selected when the warning lead time is longer and the warning systems are highly reliable, which resulted in higher safety benefits and higher subjective rating. Command warnings could be selected when the warning lead time is shorter since they led to more safety benefits, but such selection has to be made with caution since command warnings may limit drivers’ response type and were perceived as less helpful than notification warnings.}

abstract = {Recent technological advancements bring the Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) era closer to reality. CAVs have the potential to vastly improve road safety by taking the human driver out of the driving task. However, the evaluation of their safety impacts has been a major challenge due to the lack of real-world CAV exposure data. Studies that attempt to simulate CAVs by using either a single or integrating multiple simulation platforms have limitations, and in most cases, consider a small element of a network (e.g. a junction) and do not perform safety evaluations due to inherent complexity. This paper addresses this problem by developing a decision-making CAV control algorithm in the simulation software VISSIM, using its External Driver Model Application Programming Interface. More specifically, the developed CAV control algorithm allows a CAV, for the first time, to have longitudinal control, search adjacent vehicles, identify nearby CAVs and make lateral decisions based on a ruleset associated with motorway traffic operations. A motorway corridor within M1 in England is designed in VISSIM and employed to implement the CAV control algorithm. Five simulation models are created, one for each weekday. The baseline models (i.e. CAV market penetration: 0%) are calibrated and validated using real-world minute-level inductive loop detector data and also data collected from a radar-equipped vehicle. The safety evaluation of the proposed algorithm is conducted using the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM). The results show that CAVs bring about compelling benefit to road safety as traffic conflicts significantly reduce even at relatively low market penetration rates. Specifically, estimated traffic conflicts were reduced by 12–47%, 50–80%, 82–92% and 90–94% for 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% CAV penetration rates respectively. Finally, the results indicate that the presence of CAVs ensured efficient traffic flow.}

The study on which the article is based included worry as a feeling that emerges as a result of an individual's cognitive assessment of risk, attitudes toward traffic rules, risk tolerance and safety priority. The study was based on a questionnaire survey carried out among cyclists from Trondheim Municipality in Norway (n = 291) during spring 2017. The results revealed seasonal differences in perceived risk and that risk perception was an important predictor of both the decision as to whether to cycle and the frequency of cycling during wintertime. The same results were not found for cycling during the other seasons of the year. Additionally, an association was found between risk perception and worry. The respondents were more worried when cycling in winter conditions compared with cycling in summer conditions, and worry was a strong predictor of travel mode behaviour. The authors found that when the respondents' perception of risk was very low, they were not worried and hence their behaviour was not affected. Perceived risk and worry were only associated with cycling behaviour during wintertime. These findings may be used as a guide in measures implemented to increase the number of cyclists during winter and in communications to the public about the risks linked to cycling.}

The duration of the programme is one or two years, depending on the severity of the drink driving offence. This study aims to improve our knowledge of drink drivers’ views of the programme, among both participants and those who chose not to participate.

Of 1550 questionnaires mailed to participants and 1492 to non-participants, 689 and 408 were completed, for response rates of 45% among participants and 28% among non-participants (excluding returns because of incorrect addresses or because the respondent was deceased). For participants who were employed or had their own business (n = 513), the main reasons for choosing the alcohol interlock were the need to operate a vehicle at work (69.6%, 95% CI: 65.6–73.6%) and to get to/from work (69.4%, 95% CI: 65.4–73.4%). For those not working (n = 153), the main reasons for participating were that the driving license was required to have a social life and meaningful leisure time (79.7%, 95% CI: 73.3–86.2%) and for shopping (65.4%, 95% CI: 57.7–73.0%). For non-participants, the main reasons for not applying were programme costs (64.4%, 95% CI: 59.5–69.3%), being afraid of being considered alcoholics (37.1%, 95% CI: 32.2–42.1%), and doing well without a license (26.5%, 95% CI: 22.0–31.0%). The results also indicate improved health after the drink driving offence. The largest improvement was found in participants in the two-year programme, in which the proportion of respondents who felt good or very good increased by 39.4% (95% CI: 34.2–44.5%) compared to before the drink driving offence.}

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, sensor fusion and algorithms have brought about the introduction of a proactive safety management system closer to reality. The basic prerequisite for developing such a system is to have a reliable crash prediction model that takes real-time traffic data as input and evaluates their association with crash risk. Since the early 21st century, several studies have focused on developing such models. Although the idea has considerably matured over time, the endeavours have been quite discrete and fragmented at best because the fundamental aspects of the overall modelling approach substantially vary. Therefore, a number of transitional challenges have to be identified and subsequently addressed before a ubiquitous proactive safety management system can be formulated, designed and implemented in real-world scenarios. This manuscript conducts a comprehensive review of existing real-time crash prediction models with the aim of illustrating the state-of-the-art and systematically synthesizing the thoughts presented in existing studies in order to facilitate its translation from an idea into a ready to use technology. Towards that journey, it conducts a systematic review by applying various text mining methods and topic modelling. Based on the findings, this paper ascertains the development pathways followed in various studies, formulates the ubiquitous design requirements of such models from existing studies and knowledge of similar systems. Finally, this study evaluates the universality and design compatibility of existing models. This paper is, therefore, expected to serve as a one stop knowledge source for facilitating a faster transition from the idea of real-time crash prediction models to a real-world operational proactive traffic safety management system.}

While a few past studies have examined the impact of ASCT on crash frequency, little is known about its effect on injury severity outcomes. Similarly, the impact of different types of ASCTs deployed across different states is also uncertain. This paper therefore, used ordered probit models with random parameters to estimate the injury severity outcomes resulting from ASCT deployment across Pennsylvania and Virginia. Two disparate systems deployed across the two different states were analyzed to assess whether they had similar impacts on injury severity, although signal timings are optimized using different algorithms by both systems. The estimation results revealed that both ASCT systems were associated with reductions in injury severity levels. Marginal effects showed that Type A ASCT systems reduced the propensity of severe plus moderate and minor injury crashes by 11.70% and 10.36% while type B ASCT reduced the propensity of severe plus moderate and minor injury crashes by 4.39% and 6.92%. Similarly, the ASCTs deployed across the two states were also observed to reduce injury severities. The combined best fit model also revealed a similar trend towards reductions in severe plus moderate and minor injury crashes by 5.24% and 9.91%. This model performed well on validation data with a low forecast error of 0.301 and was also observed to be spatially transferable. These results encourage the consideration of ASCT deployments at intersections with high crash severities and have practical implications for aiding agencies in making future deployment decisions about ASCT.}

Recorded videos were coded for helmet use, number of riders on the motorcycle, rider position, gender, and time of day. Generally, motorcycle helmet use in Myanmar was found to be low with only 51.5% percent of riders wearing a helmet. Helmet use was highest for drivers (68.1%) and decreased for every additional passenger. It was lowest for children standing on the floorboard of the motorcycle (11.3%). During the day, helmet use followed a unimodal distribution, with the highest use observed during the late morning and lowest use observed in the early morning and late afternoon. Helmet use varied significantly between observation sites, ranging from 74.8% in Mandalay to 26.9% in Pakokku. In Mandalay, female riders had a higher helmet use than male riders, and helmet use decreased drastically on a national holiday in the city. Helmet use of motorcycle riders in Myanmar follows distinct patterns. Knowledge of these patterns can be used to design more precise helmet use evaluations and guide traffic law policy and police enforcement measures. Video based observation proved to be an efficient tool to collect helmet use data.}

abstract = {Objective
A wide variety of driving self-report measures are purported to assess drivers’ behaviors and emotions. However, little is known about the underlying factor structure of these measures. This study examined the factor structure of several self-report measures frequently utilized in the assessment of driving-related behaviors and emotions.
Design
Cohort survey in a large sample (n = 287) of young adults (mean age = 19.91 years, SD = 1.65).
Results
Exploratory factor analysis revealed a four-factor structure that included reckless driving behaviors, negative driving-related emotions, aggressive driving behaviors in response to perceived transgressions from other drivers, and perceived aggressive driving behaviors from other drivers. Aggressive driving behaviors not performed in response to other drivers loaded onto both aggressive driving-related factors.
Conclusions
The factor structure derived in the present study suggests considerable overlap in the content across commonly administered driving self-reports, while also suggesting four distinct dimensions of self-reported driving emotions and behaviors. Whereas some of these dimensions have been explored considerably in the literature (e.g., negative emotions), others deserve further exploration (e.g., perceived aggressive driving behaviors from other drivers). Implications for clinical practice and future investigations are discussed.}

abstract = {Safety Performance Functions (SPFs) play a prominent role in estimating intersection crashes, and identifying the sites with the highest potential for safety improvement. To maximize the crash prediction accuracy, this paper describes the application of different functional forms of the Negative Binomial (NB) models (i.e. NB-1, NB-2 and NB-P) in estimating safety performance functions by crash type for three types of rural two-lane intersections, including three-leg stop-controlled (3ST) intersections, four-leg stop-controlled (4ST) intersections and four-leg signalized (4SG) intersections. Crash types were aggregated into same-direction, opposite-direction, intersecting-direction and single-vehicle crashes. Major and minor road Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) were used as predictors in the SPF estimation. In addition, major and minor road AADT were also used as predictors in the estimation of the over-dispersion parameter of the NB models to account for the crash data heterogeneity. In the end, all NB models were compared based on both the model estimation goodness-of-fit and the prediction performance. The model goodness-of-fit indicates that the NB-P model outperforms the NB-1 and NB-2 models for most crash types and intersection types, by providing a flexible variance structure to the NB approaches. The parameterization of the over-dispersion factor verifies that the over-dispersion parameter of the NB models highly depends on how the variance structure is defined in the model, and the over-dispersion parameter is shown to vary among different intersections for each crash type and can be estimated using both the major and minor road AADT at rural two-lane intersections. The NB-P model is found to more effectively capture the variation of over-dispersion among intersections in NB models, which benefits the accommodation of data heterogeneity in intersection SPF development. The prediction performance comparison illustrates that the NB-P model slightly improves the crash prediction accuracy compared with the other two models, especially for the 3ST and 4SG intersections. In conclusion, the NB-P model with parameterized over-dispersion factor is recommended to provide more unbiased parameter estimates when estimating SPFs by crash type for rural two-lane intersections.}

abstract = {Introduction
There is an outstanding need to identify predictors of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) among young adults, particularly women. Impulsivity, or the tendency to act without thinking, is a predictor of DUI, but the specific facets of impulsivity that predict DUI and their interaction with sex differences remain unclear. We aimed to investigate sex differences in the link between impulsivity facets and DUI. Moreover, we sought to replicate previous findings regarding sex differences on impulsivity, and associations between impulsivity facets and DUI.
Method
A total of 506 university students participated in the study (males, n = 128; females, n = 378). Participants completed measures of impulsivity (UPPS-P short version), alcohol use (AUDIT-C), frequency of DUI episodes and related perception of risk. The UPPS-P assesses five facets of impulsivity: sensation seeking, (lack of) premeditation and perseverance and positive and negative urgency.
Results
Men showed higher sensation seeking and lack of perseverance, alcohol use and DUI frequency and lower risk perception than women. DUI frequency was negatively associated with perception of risk and positively associated with alcohol use and the five impulsivity facets. After controlling for alcohol use and risk perception, only lack of premeditation was associated with DUI frequency in the whole sample. Sensation seeking was positively associated with DUI frequency only in women.
Discussion
The link between lack of premeditation and DUI suggest that pre-drinking planning strategies can contribute to prevent risky driving. In women, specific links between sensation seeking and DUI suggest the need for personality-tailored prevention strategies.}

abstract = {Background
A novel bicycle helmet concept has been developed to mitigate rotational head acceleration, which is a predominant mechanism of traumatic brain injury (TBI). This WAVECEL concept employs a collapsible cellular structure that is recessed within the helmet to provide a rotational suspension. This cellular concept differs from other bicycle helmet technologies for mitigation of rotational head acceleration, such as the commercially available Multi-Directional Impact Protection System (MIPS) technology which employs a slip liner to permit sliding between the helmet and the head during impact. This study quantified the efficacy of both, the WAVECEL cellular concept, and a MIPS helmet, in direct comparison to a traditional bicycle helmet made of rigid expanded polystyrene (EPS).
Methods
Three bicycle helmet types were subjected to oblique impacts in guided vertical drop tests onto an angled anvil: traditional EPS helmets (CONTROL group); helmets with a MIPS slip liner (SLIP group); and helmets with a WAVECEL cellular structure (CELL group). Helmet performance was evaluated using 4.8 m/s impacts onto anvils angled at 30°, 45°, and 60° from the horizontal plane. In addition, helmet performance was tested at a faster speed of 6.2 m/s onto the 45° anvil. Five helmets were tested under each of the four impact conditions for each of the three groups, requiring a total of 60 helmets. Headform kinematics were acquired and used to calculate an injury risk criterion for Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) 2 brain injury.
Results
Linear acceleration of the headform remained below 90 g and was not associated with the risk of skull fracture in any impact scenario and helmet type. Headform rotational acceleration in the CONTROL group was highest for 6.2 m/s impacts onto the 45° anvil (7.2 ± 0.6 krad/s2). In this impact scenario, SLIP helmets and CELL helmets reduced rotational acceleration by 22% (p = 0003) and 73% (p < 0.001), respectively, compared to CONTROL helmets. The CONTROL group had the highest AIS 2 brain injury risk of 59 ± 8% for 6.2 m/s impacts onto the 45° anvil. In this impact scenario, SLIP helmets and CELL helmets reduced the AIS 2 brain injury risk to 34.2% (p = 0.001) and 1.2% (p < 0.001), respectively, compared to CONTROL helmets.
Discussion
Results of this study are limited to a narrow range of impact conditions, but demonstrated the potential that rotational acceleration and the associated brain injury risk can be significantly reduced by the cellular WAVECEL concept or a MIPS slip liner. Results obtained under specific impact angles and impact velocities indicated performance differences between these mechanisms. These differences emphasize the need for continued research and development efforts toward helmet technologies that further improve protection from brain injury over a wide range a realistic impact parameters.}

A three-year crash dataset including all rural single-vehicle crashes under rain conditions from 2012 to 2014 in four South Central states, i.e., Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana, are selected in this paper to analyze the impact factors on driver injury severity. The mixed logit model (MLM) and the latent class model (LCM) are developed on the same dataset. Several parsimony indices, e.g., AIC and BIC, and as well as McFadden pseudo r-squared, are calculated for all the models to evaluate their respective performance. Results show that choosing the uniform distribution as the prior for random parameters could better improve the goodness-of-fit of the MLM than using normal and lognormal distributions. In addition, the two-class LCM also shows superiority when compared to three- and four-class LCMs. Finally, a careful comparison between these two models is conducted, and the results indicate that the LCM has a slightly better performance in analyzing the aforementioned dataset in this study. Model estimation results show that curve, on grade, signal control, multiple lanes, pickup, straight, drug/alcohol impaired, and seat belt not used can significantly increase the probability of incapacitating injuries and fatalities for drivers in the two models. On the other hand, wet, male, semi-trailer, and young can significantly decrease the probability of incapacitating injuries and fatalities for drivers. This study provides an insightful understanding of the effects of these attributes on rural single-vehicle crashes under rain conditions and beneficial references for developing effective countermeasures for severe injury prevention.}

Yet little research has comprehensively explored cut-in behavior, particularly in China, which has a challenging driving environment and is often used for connected and autonomous vehicle testing. This study developed an extraction algorithm to retrieve 5608 cut-in events from the Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study. The data were used to identify cut-in characteristics, including motivation, turn signal usage, duration, urgency, and impact. Results showed that almost half of drivers did not use a turn signal when cutting in, and that cut-ins had a shorter time to collision (TTC) than other lane changing. A lognormal distribution was found to produce the best fit for cut-in duration, which varied from 0.7 s to 12.4 s. As characteristics were found to vary by roadway type and motivation, multilevel mixed-effects linear models were developed to examine the influencing factors of cut-in gap acceptance. Acceptance of lead and lag gaps was significantly affected by environmental variables, vehicle type, and kinematic parameters, which has important implications for microsimulation, as does the large variance in duration that makes specifying duration essential when setting scenarios. Improvement in safety education is warranted by the high degrees of risk and aggression shown by TTC and turn signal usage; but the ability of drivers, who needed to yield to the cut-in, to predict danger and adopt safe, suitable, and timely strategies suggests that advanced driver assistance systems and connected and autonomous vehicles can learn similar responses.}

abstract = {Objectives
In western countries, a typical car-motorcycle crash occurs at an intersection where a car manoeuvres into the path of an oncoming motorcycle, which involves a car driver violates motorcycle’s right of way (ROW). In Taiwan, however, a unique type of crash (approach-turn crash) occurs when a turning (including U-turn) motorcycle frequently infringes upon a car’s ROW. The primary objective of this study was to examine injuries sustained by motorcyclists in this unique type of crash.
Method
Using the linked data from the National Taiwan Crash Database and the National Health Insurance Research Data from 2003 to 2015, this study examined several anatomical injuries (e.g., head and face, neck, chest and abdomen, spine, and lower extremities), as well as the resulting injury severity (e.g., death within 30 days, hospitalisation, and emergency visit only/outpatient, and length of hospital stay). Variables examined include demographic data (sex, age, alcohol use, license status, and helmet use), vehicle attributes (engine size, type of crash partner, and crash type), road and environmental factors (curvature, crash location, day of week and time of crash). Injuries sustained by motorcyclists in an approach-turn motorcycle-turning crash (motorcycle is a ROW violator) were compared with those sustained by motorcyclists in an approach-turn car-turning crash (car is the ROW violator).
Results
A total of 21,919 motorcyclists were enrolled, of whom 18,041 and 3878 were motorcyclists involved in approach-turn car-turning and motorcycle-turning crashes, respectively. The percentage of death within 30 days; hospitalisation; length of hospital stay; and injuries to the head and face, neck, and chest and abdomen were significantly higher for motorcyclists in approach-turn motorcycle-turning crashes. Results of logistic regression models revealed that riding under the influence of alcohol and riding without a licence were associated with death/hospitalisation, and injuries to particular body regions (head and face, neck, and chest and abdomen). Helmet use was associated with a decreased likelihood of head and face and neck injuries.
Conclusion
Motorcyclists tended to be more severely or fatally injured and had increased head and face, neck, and chest and abdomen injuries when they were ROW violators than when their ROWs were violated at an intersection. Efforts to curb drunk riding and unlicensed riding may constitute effective intervention points.}

To understand the proneness of high injury severity for vehicle operators brought about by SV crashes without the confounding influence of other road users, this study focuses on those SV crashes without colliding with pedestrians, which are defined as out-of-control SV crashes given the general consequence of involved vehicles. Moreover, to compare the influence of contributory factors (including driver-vehicle/rider-vehicle, roadway, and environmental characteristics) by vehicle types, the injury severity for riders of motorized two-wheelers and drivers of other motorized vehicles are investigated separately using two disaggregated ordered probit models. The results show that for both riders and drivers, variables such as age (65 and above), drink driving, error type of failing to have proper control, driving maneuvers of left and right turns as well as driving after midnight are associated with more severe injuries whereas factors such as wet, oily or sandy surfaces are related to less severe injury. Four other variables, i.e., foreign vehicle registration, probation or expired license, high speed-limit roads, and type of median lane, have different influences on riders and drivers on injury severity. Additionally, factors such as road traffic type and nationality are only found to significantly influence only riders and drivers respectively. The results shed light on both the similar and different causes of high injury severity for riders and drivers involved in out-of-control SV crashes. Based on the findings, targeted countermeasures may be introduced from multiple perspectives such as driver education and policy development to improve non-traffic-interactive safety.}

Two distinct cases were investigated; the determination of the maximum attainable constant speed (termed as safe speed) at impending skid conditions as well as the case of comfortable curve negotiation where lower constant speed values were utilized. The overall objective was to define the safety margins for each examined case. From the interaction between road geometry, pavement friction and vehicle characteristics, many interesting findings are reported, where some of them are beyond the confined field of road geometry parameters; such as demanded longitudinal and lateral friction values and horse-power utilization rates. From the road geometry point of view, it was found that control alignments on steep upgrades consisting of low design speed values and combined with poor friction pavements are critical in terms of safety. Such cases should be treated very cautiously through certain actions. These actions include the adoption of acceptable arrangements for the above values regarding new alignments, posted speed management for existing but also scheduling friction improvement programmes more accurately for both cases.}

The objective of this study was to improve the accuracy of these forecasts through structural time-series models that include effects of meteorological conditions. The results show that, compared to the earlier heuristic approach, root mean squared errors are reduced by up to 55% and only two out of the 27 different data series yield a modest rise of prediction errors.

Rich information generated from connected vehicles could be used to obtain surrogate safety measures (SSMs) for risk identification. Conventional SSMs such as time to collision (TTC) neglect the potential risk of car-following scenarios in which the following vehicle’s speed is slightly less than or equal to the leading vehicle’s but the spacing between two vehicles is relatively small that a slight disturbance would yield collision risk. To address this limitation, this study proposes time to collision with disturbance (TTCD) for risk identification. By imposing a hypothetical disturbance, TTCD can capture rear-end conflict risks in various car following scenarios, even when the leading vehicle has a higher speed. Real-world connected vehicle pilot test data collected in Ann Arbor, Michigan is used in this study. A detailed procedure of cleaning and processing the connected vehicle data is presented. Results show that risk rate identified by TTCD can achieve a higher Pearson’s correlation coefficient with rear-end crash rate than other traditional SSMs. We show that high-risk locations identified by connected vehicle data from a relatively shorter time period are similar to the ones identified by using the historical crash data. The proposed method can substantially reduce the data collection time, compared with traditional safety analysis that generally requires more than three years to get sufficient crash data. The connected vehicle data has thus shown the potential to be used to develop proactive safety solutions and the risk factors can be eliminated in a timely manner.}

Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) programs are effective at reducing teen crash risk, but teen crash rates remain high. Between-state variation in the teen crash rate reduction following GDL implementation has been documented, but this is the first study to examine small-area variation in such a reduction. Fusing together crash data from the Michigan State Police, census data, and organizational data (alcohol outlet, movie theatre, and school locations), we analyzed spatial correlates of teen injury crash, and place-based features that modified the injury crash rate difference following GDL implementation. Specifically, using census-based units, we estimated changes in injury crash rates among teens using negative binomial regression controlling for spatial autocorrelation, and tested whether any measured spatial characteristics modified the crash rate change in the pre versus post GDL periods. There was a substantial reduction in teen crashes after GDL implementation (RR = 0.66, 95%CI: [0.65, 0.67]), and this effect was robust across gender and time-of-day (light/dark). We found evidence that this reduction varied across space; areas with more alcohol outlets corresponded to a larger daytime crash rate reduction post-GDL, while areas near schools corresponded to a smaller daytime crash rate reduction. Concentrations of movie theatres corresponded to larger post-GDL crash rate reductions after dark. Maximizing the substantial successes of GDL programs requires understanding why crash rate reductions were larger in some areas following GDL implementation, and harnessing that understanding to improve its effectiveness across a state, focusing on identifying priorities for improving driver training (e.g., by parents and driver educators), law enforcement, and future policy changes to current GDL laws.}

Although the effect of distraction on simulated driving performance has been studied extensively, comparatively little research based on field tests has been performed on the effects of high driving speeds on lateral driving performance during naturalistic distraction (the driver was unaware of the research topic). In this study, an instrumented vehicle is used to examine the impact of speed and naturalistic visual distraction (rear vehicle’s velocity and relative distance estimation) on a driver’s ability to keep in the lane. Similar to results from previous studies, visual distraction resulted in an impaired ability to keep in a lane compared to normal driving. Further investigation of steering control parameters showed an increase in steering wheel reversal rates (SRRs at 1.3° and 2.5° levels) and the standard deviation of steering wheel acceleration (SDSWA). The results of this study indicated that the standard deviation of lane positioning (SDLP) and trajectory offset (TO) increased as speed increased. As speed increased, the growth rates of SDLP and TO in the visual distraction task were the same as that in normal driving. Moreover, the SRRs and steering wheel acceleration (SWA) decreased with increased speed. As speed increased, the growth rates of SRRs and SWA during a visual distraction task were the same as that during normal driving. These results suggest that driving speed has a similar effect on driving performance during both distracted driving and normal driving.}

Using emotional contagion theory and the neural model of emotion and cognition, we tested the proposition that higher contagion of anger (i.e., a negative emotion accompanied by dysfunctional cognition) would be associated with greater cognitive failures, whereas higher contagion of joy (i.e., a positive emotion accompanied by pleasant information processing, attention and positive cognition) would be associated with fewer cognitive failures. In turn, cognitive failures were predicted to be related to higher rates of subsequent workplace accidents. Using a two-wave lagged design, anonymous survey data collected from N = 390 working adults in the U.S. supported the hypothesized mediation model. Specifically, emotional contagion of anger positively predicted cognitive failures, whereas emotional contagion of joy negatively predicted cognitive failures. Furthermore, cognitive failures positively predicted experienced accidents and fully mediated the relationship between contagion of joy/anger and experienced accidents. These findings suggest that lapses in cognitive functioning may be prevented by positive emotions (and enhanced by negative emotions) that employees absorb during social interactions at work and represent a more proximal source of accidents in comparison to emotions. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed in light of the globally rising rates of workplace accidents and related costs for safety.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a comprehensive and unified framework for analysing the impacts on traffic injury of measures influencing speed. The key tool for analysis is a specification of the speed distribution, which in most cases closely approximates a standard normal distribution. The speed distribution can be represented, for example, by twelve intervals each comprising one half standard deviation. The exponential model of the relationship between speed and the number of injured road users is applied to estimate the expected injury rate for drivers travelling at the mean speed of any part of the distribution. The relationship between individual driver speed and accident involvement is then incorporated into the speed distribution. A speed distribution specified this way represents both the mean speed of traffic and the variation in speed-related risk between drivers. Impacts of changes in speed that can be modelled include: (1) Shifting the whole speed distribution, (2) Compressing the upper end of the speed distribution, (3) Enlarging or reducing the variance of the speed distribution, (4) Selective changes in specific regions of the speed distribution. Examples are given of how knowledge of the impacts of measures on speed can be translated into expected changes in the number of injured road users by relying on the analytic framework.}

Whilst most of the developed countries have been trying to deter this behaviour through legislation, enforcement and educational campaigns, in Ukraine, where the road fatality rate is the highest in Europe, this issue has only recently become publicised. The present study examined psychological factors that are associated with hand-held mobile phone use while driving among a sample of Ukrainian drivers, in particular writing or reading a text message while driving. This included drivers’ behavioural, normative, and control beliefs relating to mobile phone use while driving, as well as the degree to which using a mobile phone is integral to one’s everyday life (measured using the Mobile Phone Involvement Questionnaire; MPIQ). Almost one quarter to one third of the sample reported using their phone on a daily basis to write (22.2%) or read (38.2%) text messages while driving. A binary logistic regression showed that gender, higher MPIQ scores, perceived approval from family members, lower perceived likelihood of receiving traffic fines and less demanding traffic conditions were all significantly associated with mobile phone use while driving. These results suggest that dependence upon a mobile phone in everyday life may be an important factor to consider when developing interventions to reduce hand-held mobile phone use while driving.}

This paper presents an attempt to evaluate the effect of countermeasures aimed at mitigating this usage. These countermeasures, which are automatically activated, may be considered "soft blockers": silencing and hiding notifications, as well as sending an automatic reply to the person trying to contact the driver. A naturalistic study was conducted with 167 young Israeli drivers, who installed a research-oriented smartphone app, which continuously monitored their smartphones usage while driving and, in addition, activated “soft blocking” in the study’s intervention stage. The evaluation is based on measures which capture the number of times drivers "touch" their smartphone screens, and on the vehicle’s speed when these screen-touches occur. The results, based on 6633 hours of driving logged on 23,019 trips, indicate that a reduction of approximately 20% was obtained in the average number of screen-touches during the intervention stage of the study; that is, in the experimental groups but also in the control group, which was merely monitored. In addition, when young drivers touched the screen, the vehicle was more likely not in motion. The current paper highlights the potential of “soft blockers”, as well as the awareness of being monitored, for mitigating smartphone usage while driving.}

These technologies can assist the driver in maintaining control of the vehicle when a possibly dangerous situation arises by issuing alerts to the driver and in a few cases, responding to the situation itself. This paper estimates the societal and private benefits and costs associated with three crash avoidance technologies, blind-spot monitoring, lane departure warning, and forward-collision warning, for all light duty passenger vehicles in the U.S. for the year 2015. The three technologies could collectively prevent up to 1.6 million crashes each year including 7200 fatal crashes. In this paper, the authors estimated the net-societal benefits to the overall society from avoiding the cost of the crashes while also estimating the private share of those benefits that are directly affecting the crash victims. For the first generation warning systems, net-societal benefits and net-private benefits are positive. Moreover, the newer generation of improved warning systems and active braking should make net benefits even more advantageous.}

To account for the spatial correlations among TAZs, a Bayesian conditional autoregressive negative binomial model was estimated, linking crash frequencies in each TAZ to several independent variables. Modeling results showed that higher crash frequencies are associated with greater populations, road densities, total length of major and minor arterials, trip frequencies, and with shorter intersection spacing. The results from this study can help transportation planners and managers identify the crash contributing factors, and can lead to the development of improved safety planning and management.}

Paramedics face several safety risks in their occupation, and crashes during emergency response driving (ERD) are quite common. However, there is a need for more research to develop educational and implementation suggestions to determine how these risks can be reduced and managed. In this study, we examined what risk factors Finnish paramedics recognize when performing ERD.
Methods
The study material consisted of 161 pages of material that had been written by experienced paramedics (n = 44) who were master’s degree students of South-Eastern Finland University of Applied Sciences in fall 2017. They wrote essays based solely on their own thoughts and experiences regarding the risk factors associated with ERD. The material was analyzed via inductive content analysis.
Results
Two main categories were found: Crew-related risk factors and environmental risk factors. These categories could be further divided into eight sub-categories. The crew-related risk factors consisted of lack of education and training for ERD, insufficient concentration on driving, irresponsibility and indifference, crew member’s inability to take collective responsibility for safety as a team, and excessive load experienced by the driver. Environmental risk factors consisted of demanding handling of ambulance, poor visibility, and other road users.
Conclusions
Finnish paramedics recognized several risk factors in ERD. Some of the factors have been noted in previous literature regarding ambulance crashes and should be addressed as a matter of urgency to improve safety. Overall, better knowledge regarding these risks needs to be developed worldwide. The results led to several further study suggestions.}

Traditional screening techniques model crashes using regression and historical crash data, making them intrinsically reactive. In response, surrogate measures of safety have become a popular proactive alternative. The purpose of this paper is to develop models for crash frequency and severity incorporating GPS-derived surrogate safety measures (SSMs) as predictive variables. SSMs based on vehicle manoeuvres and traffic flow were extracted from data collected in Quebec City. The mixed multivariate outcome is estimated using two models; a Full Bayes Spatial Negative Binomial model for crash frequency estimated using the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation approach and a fractional Multinomial Logit model for crash severity. Model outcomes are combined to generate posterior expected crash frequency at each severity level and rank sites based on crash cost. The crash frequency model was accurate at the network scale, with the majority of proposed SSMs statistically significant at 95% confidence and the direction of their effect generally consistent with previous research. In the crash severity model, fewer variables were significant, yet the direction of the effect of all significant variables was again consistent with previous research. Correlations between rankings predicted by the mixed multivariate model and by the crash data were adequate for intersections (0.46) but were poorer for links (0.25). The ability to prioritize sites based on GPS data and SSMs rather than historical crash data represents a substantial contribution to the field of road safety.}

This analysis was carried out within the SafetyCube project, which aimed to identify and quantify the effects of risk factors and measures related to behaviour, infrastructure or vehicles, and integrate the results in an innovative road safety Decision Support System (DSS). The evaluation was conducted by examining studies from the existing literature. These were selected and analysed using a specifically designed common methodology. Infrastructure risk factors were structured in a hierarchical taxonomy of 10 areas with several risk factors in each area (59 specific risk factors in total), examples include: alignment features (e.g. horizontal-vertical alignment deficiencies), cross-section characteristics (e.g. superelevation, lanes, median and shoulder deficiencies), road surface deficiencies, workzones, junction deficiencies (interchange and at-grade) etc. Consultation with infrastructure stakeholders (international organisations, road authorities, etc.) took place in dedicated workshops to identify user needs for the DSS, as well as “hot topics” of particular importance. The following analysis methodology was applied to each infrastructure risk factor: (i) A search for relevant international literature, (ii) Selection of studies on the basis of rigorous criteria, (iii) Analysis of studies in terms of design, methods and limitations, (iv) Synthesis of findings - and meta-analysis, when feasible. In total 243 recent and high quality studies were selected and analysed. Synthesis of results was made through 39 ‘Synopses’ (including 4 original meta-analyses) on individual risk factors or groups of risk factors. This allowed the ranking of infrastructure risk factors into three groups: risky (11 risk factors), probably risky (18 risk factors), and unclear (7 risk factors).}

The model parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood on lane changing data at a freeway on-ramp using the NGSIM dataset. Based on the estimated parameters it was concluded that longer acceleration lanes and reduction of speed limits on on-ramps could help significantly reduce likelihood of conflict.

Previous studies show that inattention and distraction are more often contributing factors in severe crashes, compared to less severe crashes. The correlation with severity appears to vary with the type of inattention. The aim of the present study was to conduct a comprehensive mapping of the types of inattention that contribute to fatal road crashes. This was done by exploring data from in-depth investigations of all fatal road crashes in Norway between 2011 and 2015 conducted by crash investigation teams of the Norwegian Public Roads Administration. Crash reports were selected for screening, based on codes indicating inattention as a possible contributing factor. Inattention among at-fault drivers of motor vehicles was found to contribute to almost one out of three fatal road crashes between 2011 and 2015. About one-third of inattention-related crashes involved pedestrians who were hit by motor vehicles, where the driver typically detected the pedestrian too late. Failure to check for information in blind spots or behind other sight obstructions is a typical form of inattention. Distraction by use of mobile phones contributed to between two and four percent of all fatal crashes, while other sources of distraction, within or outside of the vehicle, contributed to about ten percent. Driver inattention may be preventable by a system-oriented approach including a combination of vehicle technology, road and road environment improvements, appropriate signs and markings, education and information, as well as legal measures and enforcement regarding use of mobile phones, in-vehicle sight obstructions, and involvement in other secondary tasks during driving.}

abstract = {Purpose
Interaction is the process of behavior adaption between two or more participants primarily based on what they visually perceive. It is an important aspect of traffic participation and supports a safe and efficient flow of traffic. However, prior driving simulator studies investigating the effects of vision impairment have typically used pre-programmed pedestrians that did not interact with the human driver. In the current study we used a linked pedestrian and driving simulator setting to increase the ecological validity of the experimental paradigm. We evaluated the effects of mild vision loss on interactions between drivers and human-controlled, interactive pedestrians compared to preprogrammed, non-interactive pedestrians.
Method
Young subjects (mean age 31 years) wore safety goggles with diffusing filters that reduced visual acuity to 20/50 Snellen and contrast sensitivity to 1.49 log units. Two types of crossings (zebra vs. free lane) and two types of pedestrians (non-interactive vs. interactive) were presented to the driver using a multiple simulator setting. Gaze, safety and time series measures were analyzed to quantify the behavior of the participants during the different crossing situations.
Results
Simulated vision impairment significantly increased the time taken to first fixate on the pedestrian, but only had mild adverse effects on safety measures and subsequent interactions. By comparison, pedestrian type and crossing type were found to significantly affect interaction measures. In crossings with the interactive pedestrians the behavior adaption between the driver and the pedestrian took longer and was less correlated in contrast to the situations with the non-interactive pedestrian.
Conclusion
Mild vision impairment (slightly worse than the common 20/40 requirement for driving) had little effect on interactions with pedestrians once they were detected and only had mild adverse consequences on driving safety. Time series measures were sensitive to differences in behavior adaption between road users depending on the level of interaction and type of crossing situation.}

Rear-end crashes in freeways can be collectively attributed to drivers, vehicles, and road infrastructure, but driving behavior plays a key role in influencing car-following safety. This study aims to investigate the impact of heterogeneity of driving behavior on rear-end crash risk. Driving behavior depends on perceived risk levels, acceleration and deceleration habits, and driver reaction characteristics. Thus, the influencing factors of rear-end crash risk were initially analyzed by using the desired safety margin (DSM) model. Subsequently, five driving behavior parameters, including upper and lower limits of DSM, sensitivity coefficients of acceleration and deceleration, and response time, were calibrated by using the vehicle trajectories from the Next Generation Simulation I-80 datasets. Simulation experiments were designed to evaluate the impact of heterogeneity of car-following behavior on rear-end crash risk. Results showed that decreasing the lower (or upper) limit of the DSM, increasing the response time, increasing the sensitivity coefficient for acceleration, or decreasing the sensitivity coefficient for deceleration can increase rear-end crash risk. In addition, if stable and unstable driving styles coexist, then their proportions have important influences on rear-end crash risk. These results imply that two critical factors affect shock waves, namely, driving behavior characteristics and proportion of different driving styles. Thus, a potential strategy for the adjustment of the proportions of unstable driving styles can attenuate shock waves and reduce rear-end crash risk to a certain extent. Moreover, a wide extent of driving behavior heterogeneity can attenuate shock waves and subsequently reduce rear-end crash risk. Overall, driving behavior heterogeneity has an important impact on rear-end crash risk. Exploring the effect of each driving behavior parameter on rear-end crash probability is useful for urban road traffic control, and it can provide improved understanding of abnormal driving behavior characteristics to minimize rear-end crash risks.}

The taxonomy of crash causes and the prevalence of different causes are determined by the investigators, who are biased in different ways. The prevalent notion that approximately 90 percent of the crashes are due to human errors or failures is due to a threshold bias, and the implied notion that 90 percent of the countermeasures should be directed at changing these behaviors is based on an erroneous assumption that the cure must be directly linked to the stated cause.

Results showed that the proposed crash prediction and prevention method could effectively detect crash-prone conditions and evaluate the safety and mobility impacts of various safety countermeasures.}

abstract = {Despite the recognized benefits of electronic toll collection (ETC) system as an important part of toll plaza area, the mixed traffic of electronic toll collection (ETC) vehicles and manual toll collection (MTC) vehicles in the toll plaza diverging area are considered risky to vehicles, in which complex diverging and crossing behavior of vehicles would increase the collision risks. Therefore, it is vitally important to investigate the vehicle collision risk in the up stream toll plaza area. Video data are collected from a typical toll plaza in Nanjing, China, and vehicle trajectory data are extracted using an automated analysis system based on OpenCV. An extended Time-To-Collision (TTC) is proposed to evaluate the vehicle collision risk. Subsequently, the different effects on vehicle collision risk of vehicles with different toll collection types, target lanes and locations are compared. Furthermore, the random parameters logistic model is developed to investigate the effects of explanatory factors on the collision risk of vehicles diverging or adjusting their lane position. The results suggested that the MTC vehicles have the highest collision risk in the toll plaza diverging area and there are significant different effects on collision risk among vehicles with different target toll collection lanes. Further, more dangerous situations could be found for a vehicle if it is closer to the toll collection lanes and surrounded by heavy traffic. It is also confirmed that mixed traffic with MTC and ETC vehicles could increase the crash risk in the toll plaza diverging area. It is expected that the findings could help engineers and operators select the appropriate engineering and traffic control solutions to enhance the safety at the toll plaza diverging area.}

The sample consisted of 1035 high-speed rail operators in China. The results indicated that the effects of organizational-level personality on safety performance are similar to or stronger than the effects of individual-level personality. Specifically, organizational-level extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness have significantly positive relationships with individual-level safety compliance and safety participation, while neuroticism has a significantly negative relationship with safety compliance and safety participation; the effect of openness to experience was not significant. Moreover, in terms of indirect effects, job satisfaction mediated the links of the four personality constructs (extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism, and conscientiousness) with safety compliance and safety participation. These findings highlight the importance of organizational personality to improving employees’ safety performance in safety-critical organizations.}

Whether the effects of auditory distraction might interact with other sensory impairments, such as vision impairment, is of interest given that visual impairment is relatively common within the population, particularly as a result of uncorrected refractive error. In this experiment, 20 current drivers (mean age of 29.4 ± 3.2 years), binocularly viewed video recordings of traffic scenes presented as part of the Hazard Perception Test and responded to potential hazards within the traffic scenes. Half of the presented scenes included auditory navigation instructions as an auditory distractor. Additionally, some of the scenes were viewed through optical lenses to induce different levels of refractive blur (+0.50 DS, +1.00 DS and +2.00 DS). Hazard perception response times increased significantly (p < 0.05) with increasing blur. Participants were significantly slower in reacting to hazards for the +1.00 DS and +2.00 DS blur conditions compared to the control condition (with no blur). There was also a significant increase in response times to hazards in the presence of the auditory navigation instructions. The combined effect of blur and auditory instructions was additive, with the worst performance being in the presence of both blur and auditory instructions. These results suggest that the delivery of auditory navigation guidance for those with visual impairments, such as blur, which are relatively common in the population, should be further investigated.}

Participants were instructed to perform simulated taxiing tasks in each of the testing conditions. Navigation errors during taxiing were counted. In addition, eye movement measures can reflect pilots’ attention allocation, situation awareness and mental workload that are closely related to the risk of navigation errors. Thus, eye movement measures including fixation rate, average fixation duration and average pupil area were also selected as dependent variables. We found that navigation errors were fewer at night compared to in daytime. This could be explained by the finding that pilots paid more attention to the environmental clues out of the window at night, inducing better situation awareness for accurate taxiing. More complex taxi route was found to be associated with more navigation errors, but participants' visual behaviors were consistent between route complexity conditions, indicating that pilots’ visual operation strategies did not contribute to the increased number of navigation errors in the more complex taxi route condition.}

abstract = {Introduction
Cameras for detecting traffic violations have been used as a measure to improve road safety in different countries around the world. In Cali, Colombia, fixed cameras were installed in March 2012 on a number of roads and intersections. All camera devices are capable of detecting simultaneously the following traffic violations: driving over the speed limit, running a red light or stop sign, violation of the traffic ban schedule, and blocking the pedestrian crosswalk.
Objective
To evaluate the impact of camera enforcement of traffic violations in Cali, Colombia.
Methods
A quasi-experimental difference-in-differences study with before and after measurements and a comparison group was conducted. We observed 38 intervention areas and 50 comparison areas (250 m radius), during 42 months before and 34 months after the installation of cameras. Effects were estimated with mixed negative binomial regression models.
Results
In intervention areas, after 12 months, there was a reduction of 19.2% of all crashes and a 24.7% reduction of injury and fatal crashes. In comparison areas, this reduction was 15.0% for all crashes and 20.1% for injury and fatal crashes. After adjusted comparisons, intervention sites outperformed comparison sites with an additional yearly reduction of 5.3% (p = 0.045) for all crashes.
Conclusions
The use of cameras for detecting traffic violations seems to have a positive effect on the reduction of crashes in intervention areas. A beneficial spillover effect was found as well in comparison areas; but more evaluations are needed.}

These interactions are important to understand, to preempt increasing conflicts between truckers and bicyclists. In this study, a bicycling simulator experiment examined bicycle and truck interactions. The experiment was successfully completed by 48 participants. The bicycling simulator collected data regarding a participant’s velocity and lateral position. Three independent variables reflecting common engineering approaches were included in this experiment: pavement marking (L1: white lane markings with no supplemental pavement color, termed white lane markings, L2: white lane markings with solid green pavement applied on the conflict area, termed solid green, and L3: white lane markings with dashed green pavement applied on the conflict area, termed dashed green), signage (L1: No sign and L2: a truck warning sign), and truck maneuver (L1: no truck in CVLZ, L2: truck parked in CVLZ, and L3: truck pulling out of CVLZ). The results showed that truck presence does have an effect on bicyclist’s performance, and this effect varies based on the engineering and design treatments employed. Of the three independent variables, truck maneuvering had the greatest impact by decreasing mean bicyclist velocity and increasing mean lateral position. It was also observed that when a truck was present in a CVLZ, bicyclists had a lower velocity and lower divergence from right-edge of bike lane on solid green pavement, and a higher divergence from the right-edge of bike lane was observed when a warning sign was present.}

abstract = {Roundabouts are one of the safest types of intersections. However, the needs to meet the requirements of operation, capacity, traffic organization and surrounding development lead to a variety of design solutions. One of such alternatives are turbo-roundabouts, which simplify drivers’ decision making, limit lane changing in the roundabout, and induce low driving speed thanks to raised lane dividers. However, in spite of their generally positive reception, the safety impact of turbo-roundabouts has not been sufficiently studied. Given the low number of existing turbo-roundabouts and the statistical rarity of accident occurrence, the prevalent previously conducted studies applied only simple before-after designs or relied on traffic conflicts in micro-simulations. Nevertheless, the presence of raised lane dividers is acknowledged as an important feature of well performing and safe turbo-roundabouts. Following the previous Polish studies, the primary objective of the present study was assessment of influence of presence of lane dividers on road safety and developing a reliable and valid surrogate safety measure based on field data, which will circumvent the limitations of accident data or micro-simulations. The secondary objective was using the developed surrogate safety measure to assess and compare the safety levels of Polish turbo-roundabout samples with and without raised lane dividers. The surrogate safety measure was based on speed and lane behaviour. Speed was obtained from video observations and floating car data, which enabled the construction of representative speed profiles. Lane behaviour data was gathered from video observations. The collection of the data allowed for a relative validation of the method by comparing the safety performance of turbo-roundabouts with and without raised lane dividers. In the end, the surrogate measure was applied for evaluation of safety levels and enhancement of the existing safety performance functions, which combine traffic volumes, and speeds as a function of radii). The final models may help quantify the safety impact of different turbo-roundabout solutions.}

Each driver visited the laboratory three times: before, during, and after a working shift. The survey contained a demographic questionnaire and the Brief Fatigue Inventory. A following-braking simulator test session was conducted at two speeds (50 and 80 km/h) by each driver at each of his three visits, and the driver’s performance in brake reaction, lane control, speed control, and steering control were recorded. A random-effects modeling approach was incorporated to address the unobserved heterogeneity caused by the repeated measures. In the results, a recovery effect and a lagging effect were defined for the driving fatigue and performance measures because their temporal patterns were concavely quadratic and had a 1-hour delay compared to the temporal patterns of occupied taxi trips and taxi crash risk in Hong Kong. Demographic variables, such as net income and driver age, also had significant effects on the measured driving fatigue and performance. Policies regarding taxi management and operation based on the modeling results are proposed to alleviate the taxi safety situation in Hong Kong and worldwide.}

Using comprehensive toxicological data from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Maryland, we examined the prevalence of opioids in all motor vehicle crash fatalities in Maryland between 2006–2017 and tested for trends to assess the statistical significance of changes in the prevalence of prescription opioids detected in these drivers over time. Opioid-involved crash deaths accounted for 10.0% of all driver deaths during the study period. The prevalence of opioids detected in fatally injured drivers increased from 8.3% in 2006 to 14.1% in 2017, (Z = −1.9, p < .05). The trends in opioid deaths do not follow broader trends in motor vehicle crash deaths; opioid-involved crashes appear to be increasing while overall motor vehicle crashes appear to be decreasing over the same period. To determine if the increase in opioid-involved crash deaths was the result of changes in pain management related to injuries sustained from the crash, we analyzed a subgroup of cases where death occurred at the scene of the crash. Within this group, there was no statistically significant increase in opioid-involved crashes during the study period. Opioid prevalence was higher in middle aged, and white drivers, and in crashes occurring in rural counties. Geographic distribution of opioid-involved crash deaths reflect broader patterns of opioid deaths overdose across the state. Irrespective of the timing of the deaths, of the drivers testing positive for opioids, 28% had elevated blood alcohol concentrations (‡ 0.01 g/dL), and 45% tested positive for other drugs.}

Little is known about whether people respond crashes involving SDVs and human drivers differently and why. Across five vignette-based experiments in two studies (total N = 1267), for the first time, we witnessed that participants had a tendency to perceive traffic crashes involving SDVs to be more severe than those involving conventionally human-driven vehicles (HDVs) regardless of their severity (injury or fatality) or cause (SDVs/HDVs or others). Furthermore, we found that this biased response could be a result of people’s reliance on the affect heuristic. More specifically, higher prior negative affect tagged with an SDV (vs. an HDV) intensifies people’s negative affect evoked by crashes involving the SDV (vs. those involving the HDV), which subsequently results in higher perceived severity and lower acceptability of the crash. Our results imply that people’s over-reaction to crashes involving SDVs may be a psychological barrier to their adoption and that we may need to forestall a less stringent introduction policy that allows SDVs on public roads as it may lead to more crashes that could possibly deter people from adopting SDVs. We discuss other theoretical and practical implications of our results and suggest potential approaches to de-biasing people’s responses to crashes involving SDVs.}

To this end, a comprehensive literature review of relevant studies was conducted; four different copula model specifications including Frank, Clayton, Joe and Gumbel were estimated to identify the dominant factors contributing to each crash consequence indicator; the temporal effects on model estimates were investigated; the elasticity effects of the independent variables with regard to all four crash consequence indicators were measured to express the magnitude of the effects of an independent variable on the probability change for each level of four indicators; and specific countermeasures were recommended for each of the contributing factors to improve the intersection safety. The model goodness-of-fit illustrates that the Joe copula model with the parameterized copula parameters outperforms the other models, which verifies that the injury severity, crash type, vehicle damage and driver error are significantly correlated due to common observed and unobserved factors and, accounting for their correlations, can lead to more accurate model estimation results. The parameterization of the copula function indicates that their correlation varies among different crashes, including crashes that occurred at stop-controlled intersections, four-leg intersections and crashes which involved drivers younger than 25. The model coefficient estimates indicate that the driver’s age, driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol, intersection geometry and control types, and adverse weather and light conditions are the most critical factors contributing to severe crash consequences. The coefficient estimates of four-leg intersections, yield and stop-controlled intersections and adverse weather conditions varied over time, which indicates that the model estimation of crash data may not be stable over time and should be accommodated in crash prediction analysis. In the end, relevant countermeasures corresponding to law enforcement and intersection infrastructure design are recommended to all of the contributing factors identified by the model. It is anticipated that this study can shed light on selecting valid statistical models for crash data analysis, identifying intersection safety issues, and helping develop effective countermeasures to improve intersection safety.}

The previous studies used data from highly populated areas. It is questionable that the safety-in-numbers effect is still observed in areas with a low population density and small number of pedestrians. Thus, this study aims at analyzing pedestrian crashes in a suburban area in the United States and exploring if the safety-in-numbers effect is also observed. We employ a Bayesian random-parameter Poisson-lognormal model to evaluate the safety-in-numbers effects of each intersection, which can account for the heterogeneity across the observations. The results show that the safety-in-numbers effect were found only at 32 intersections out of 219. The intersections with the safety-in-numbers effect have relatively larger pedestrian activities whereas those without the safety-in-numbers effect have extremely low pedestrian activities. It is concluded that just encouraging walking might result in serious pedestrian safety issues in a suburban area without sufficient pedestrian activities. Therefore, it is plausible to provide safe walking environment first with proven countermeasures and a people-oriented policy rather than motor-oriented. After safe walking environments are guaranteed and when people recognize that walking is safe, more people will consider walking for short-distance trips. Eventually, increased pedestrian activities will result in the safety-in-numbers effects and walking will be even further safer.}

abstract = {In spite of research and awareness of the hazards associated with handheld mobile device use while driving, many motorists continue to engage in this risky behavior. The mobile device use while driving has a detrimental effect on the operation of the vehicle. It contributes significantly to distraction which is a leading cause of accidents. Especially, the use of text messaging and the dialing of a 10-digit number while driving can be attributable to crash risks. Phone use bans have a positive role in reducing mobile phone use for texting while operating vehicles. There are limited studies on whether drivers admit to the use of handheld devices while driving. The aim of this study was to identify the experiences, practices, and attitudes of handheld device use while driving. A total of 337 respondents nationwide replied to the survey on the attitudes and self-reported behaviors of handheld device use while driving. In the survey, the characteristics of handheld device users, use of handheld devices, and the differences in self-reported behaviors across states with and without device use restrictions were compared. The perceptions and experiences of device users are also examined. Based on the background of device users and their attitudes, a multivariate logistic regression is used to identify the characteristics of those who use handheld devices while driving. The model is relevant to this research because it allows the consideration and comparison of many variables to identify the attitudes of people towards distracted driving. The affirmative self-reporting of 59 percent of the respondents is a surprising result given that there are state bans on texting and the use of handheld mobile phones while driving. Older drivers are least likely to engage in these behaviors, compared to younger drivers and adult drivers. Based on the findings, targeted educational and enforcement campaigns to reduce device use during driving are suggested. Additional promising areas for further inquiry and research are also proposed.}

Efforts have been investigated to reveal the crash mechanisms and analyze the contributing factors from the aspects of vehicle, driver, and operational perspectives. In this study, special attention has been paid to the operational level analyses while bridging the research gaps of: (1) failing to identify the heterogeneous impact of microscopic traffic flow variables on crash occurrence, and (2) focusing on correlation effects without further investigations for the causal relationships. A hybrid modeling approach with latent class logit (LCL) and path analysis (PA) models was proposed to account for the heterogeneous influencing effects and reveal the causal relationships between crash occurrence and microscopic traffic flow variables. Data from Shanghai urban expressway system were utilized for the empirical analyses. First, the LCL model has concluded four latent subsets of crash occurrence influencing factors. Then, PA models were conducted to identify the concurrent relationships (direct and indirect eﬀ ;ects) for the four sets of crash occurrence influencing factors separately. Finally, the results of the LCL model and PA models were compared and the crash-prone scenarios were inferred. And the potential safety improvement countermeasures were discussed.}

To investigate the extent and patterns of regional disparities of road traffic injury rates involving elementary and junior high school children while commuting among Japan’s 47 prefectures.
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional ecological study using the national police data for 2004–2013 on the number of children who were killed or seriously injured (KSI) in traffic collisions stratified by prefecture, grade, mode of transport, and purpose of trip (commuting or non-commuting). We calculated stratified KSI rates by dividing the number of KSI cases by the corresponding number of children and presented these rates for the 47 prefectures. Also, for pedestrian elementary school children and cyclist junior high school children, we regressed the KSI rates while commuting by prefecture on the non-commuting KSI rates and the proportion of people who live in the urban, densely inhabited districts.
Results
There were 6463 KSI cases while commuting. The ratios of the highest KSI rate to the lowest KSI rate among prefectures were 12, 30, and 58 for pedestrian elementary school children and pedestrian and cyclist junior high school children, respectively. The non-commuting KSI rates and the proportion of those living in densely inhabited districts were positively and inversely associated with the commuting KSI rates, respectively. The analysis of the residuals of the regression models did not identify prefectures with significantly higher or lower KSI rates while commuting than others.
Conclusions
There were large inter-prefecture disparities in the KSI rates while commuting, and the disparity was especially large among cyclist junior high school children.}

There is a need to quantify the relationship between driver fatigue and safety in terms of operationally relevant measures. Hard-braking events are a suitable measure for this purpose as they are relatively easily observed and are correlated with collisions and near-crashes. We developed an analytic approach that predicts driver fatigue based on a biomathematical model and then estimates hard-braking events as a function of predicted fatigue, controlling for time of day to account for systematic variations in exposure (traffic density). The analysis used de-identified data from a previously published, naturalistic field study of 106 U.S. commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers. Data analyzed included drivers’ official duty logs, sleep patterns measured around the clock using wrist actigraphy, and continuous recording of vehicle data to capture hard-braking events. The curve relating predicted fatigue to hard-braking events showed that the frequency of hard-braking events increased as predicted fatigue levels worsened. For each increment on the fatigue scale, the frequency of hard-braking events increased by 7.8%. The results provide proof of concept for a novel approach that predicts fatigue based on drivers’ sleep patterns and estimates driving performance in terms of an operational metric related to safety. The approach can be translated to practice by CMV operators to achieve a fatigue risk profile specific to their own settings, in order to support data-driven decisions about fatigue countermeasures that cost-effectively deliver quantifiable operational benefits.}

Am I fit for work? This study examines a “sleep tank” model (SleepTank™), which is analogous to the fuel tank in a car, refilled by sleep, and depleted during wake. Required inputs are sleep period time and sleep efficiency (provided by many consumer-grade actigraphs). Outputs include suggested hours remaining to “get sleep” and percentage remaining in tank (Tank%). Initial proof of concept analyses were conducted using data from a laboratory-based simulated nightshift study. Ten, healthy males (18–35y) undertook an 8h baseline sleep opportunity and daytime performance testing (BL), followed by four simulated nightshifts (2000 h–0600 h), with daytime sleep opportunities (1000 h–1600 h), then an 8 h night-time sleep opportunity to return to daytime schedule (RTDS), followed by daytime performance testing. Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) and Karolinska Sleepiness Scale were performed at 1200 h on BL and RTDS, and at 1830 h, 2130 h 0000 h and 0400 h each nightshift. A 40-minute York Driving Simulation was performed at 1730 h, 2030 h and 0300 h on each nightshift. Model outputs were calculated using sleep period timing and sleep efficiency (from polysomnography) for each participant. Tank% was a significant predictor of PVT lapses (p < 0.001), and KSS (p < 0.001), such that every 5% reduction resulted in an increase of two lapses, or one point on the KSS. Tank% was also a significant predictor of %time in the Safe Zone from the driving simulator (p = 0.001), such that every 1% increase in the tank resulted in a 0.75% increase in time spent in the Safe Zone. Initial examination of the correspondence between model predictions and performance and sleepiness measures indicated relatively good predictive value. Results provide tentative evidence that this “sleep tank” model may be an informative tool to aid in individual decision-making based on sleep history.}

A cross-sectional survey was administered to 1021 taxi drivers from 21 companies in four Chinese cities and collected information about (i) sociodemographic characteristics, (ii) working conditions, (iii) frequency of daily aberrant driving behaviour, and (iv) involvement in property-damage-only (PDO) and personal injury (PI) crashes over the past two years. A hybrid bivariate model of crash involvement was specified: (i) the hybrid part concerned a latent variable model capturing unobserved traits of the taxi drivers; (ii) the bivariate part modelled jointly both types of crashes while capturing unobserved correlation between error terms. The survey answers paint a gloomy picture in terms of workload, as taxi drivers reported averages of 9.4 working hours per day and 6.7 working days per week that amount on average to about 63.0 working hours per week. Moreover, the estimates of the hybrid bivariate model reveal that increasing levels of fatigue, reckless behaviour and aggressive behaviour are positively related to a higher propensity of crash involvement. Lastly, the heavy workload is also positively correlated with the higher propensity of crashing, not only directly as a predictor of crash involvement, but also indirectly as a covariate of fatigue and aberrant driving behaviour. The findings from this study provide insights into potential strategies for preventive education and taxi industry management to improve the working conditions and hence reduce fatigue and road risk for the taxi drivers.}

abstract = {Canada’s freight rail system moves 70% of the country's surface goods and almost half of all exports (RAC, 2016). These include dangerous goods. Anonymous survey of freight rail operating employees conducted by the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference (TCRC, 2014) revealed that many do not report getting enough sleep because of their work schedules, and that fatigue may be affecting their performance at work. Besides general impairments in attention and cognitive functioning, fatigue in railway operating employees slows reaction time to safety alarms and impairs conformance to train operating requirements. Shift scheduling practices can contribute to sleep-related fatigue by restricting sleep opportunities, requiring extended periods of wakefulness and by disrupting daily (circadian) rhythms. The primary goal of accident investigation is to identify causal and contributing factors so that similar occurrences can be prevented. A database search of Transportation Safety Board (TSB) rail investigation reports published in the 21-year period from 1995 to 2015 identified 18 that cited sleep-related fatigue of freight rail operating employees as a causal, contributing, or risk finding. This number represents about 20% of TSB rail investigations from the same period in which a human factors aspect of freight train activities was a primary cause. Exploration of accident themes suggests that management of fatigue and shift scheduling in the freight rail industry is a complex issue that is often not conducive to employee circadian rhythms and sleep requirements. It also suggests that current shift scheduling and fatigue management practices may be insufficient to mitigate the associated safety risk. Railway fatigue management systems that are based on the principles of modern sleep science are needed to improve scheduling practices and mitigate the ongoing safety risk.}

Independent Component Analysis and time-frequency analysis were used to evaluate the EEG data. Results showed a positive association between distal and distal-to-proximal gradient (DPG) temperatures and reaction time (RT); increments in EEG power in alpha-, theta- and beta-band frequencies in parieto-occipital, central-medial and frontal components, were associated with poor performance (slower RT) in the task. This generalized power increment fits with an increased activity in the default mode network, associated with attention lapses. This study highlights the potential use of the PVT as a tool to obtain individual physiological indices of vigilance and fatigue that could be applied to other vigilance tasks typically performed in occupational settings.}

abstract = {The morning commute home is an especially vulnerable time for workers engaged in night shift work due to the heightened risk of experiencing drowsy driving. One strategy to manage this risk is to monitor the driver’s state in real time using an in vehicle monitoring system and to alert drivers when they are becoming sleepy. The primary objective of this study is to build and evaluate predictive models for drowsiness events occurring in morning drives using a variety of physiological and performance data gathered under a real driving scenario. We used data collected from 16 night shift workers who drove an instrumented vehicle for approximately two hours on a test track on two occasions: after a night shift and after a night of rest. Drowsiness was defined by two outcome events: performance degradation (Lane-Crossing models) and electroencephalogram (EEG) characterized sleep episodes (Microsleep Models). For each outcome, we assessed the accuracy of sets of predictors, including or not including a driver factor, eyelid measures, and driving performance measures. We also compared the predictions using different time intervals relative to the events (e.g., 1-min prior to the event through 10-min prior). By examining the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the predictive models, the results showed that the inclusion of an individual driver factor improved AUC and prediction accuracy for both outcomes. Eyelid measures improved the prediction for the Lane-Crossing models, but not for Microsleep models. Prediction performance was not changed by adding driving performance predictors or by increasing the time to the event for either outcome. The best models for both measures of drowsiness were those considering driver individual differences and eyelid measures, suggesting that these indicators should be strongly considered when predicting drowsiness events. The results of this paper can benefit the development of real-time drowsiness detection and help to manage drowsiness to avoid related motor-vehicle crashes and loss.}

Forward collision warnings (FCW) are quickly becoming standard across vehicle lineups and may prevent frontal crashes by alerting drivers. Previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of FCW for distracted drivers, but their effectiveness for other types of impairment remains unknown. Like distraction, drowsiness can impair driver response time and lead to crashes. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of FCW for moderately and severely drowsy drivers using a high-fidelity driving simulator. Drowsy drivers were divided into three warning conditions during a revealed stop vehicle forward collision event: An auditory alert, a haptic seat vibration, and a no warning baseline. Results indicate that FCW were effective at speeding drowsy driver response, but only when the drowsy drivers were looking away from the forward roadway at the onset of the event. These results have important implications for ADAS technology and driver state monitoring systems.}

abstract = {In around-the-clock operations, reduced alertness due to circadian misalignment and sleep loss causes performance impairment, which can lead to catastrophic errors and accidents. There is mounting evidence that performance on different tasks is differentially affected, but the general principles underlying this differentiation are not well understood. One factor that may be particularly relevant is the degree to which tasks require executive control, that is, control over the initiation, monitoring, and termination of actions in order to achieve goals. A key aspect of this is cognitive flexibility, i.e., the deployment of cognitive control resources to adapt to changes in events. Loss of cognitive flexibility due to sleep deprivation has been attributed to “feedback blunting,” meaning that feedback on behavioral outcomes has reduced salience - and that feedback is therefore less effective at driving behavior modification under changing circumstances. The cognitive mechanisms underlying feedback blunting are as yet unknown. Here we present data from an experiment that investigated the effects of sleep deprivation on performance after an unexpected reversal of stimulus-response mappings, requiring cognitive flexibility to maintain good performance. Nineteen healthy young adults completed a 4-day in-laboratory study. Subjects were randomized to either a total sleep deprivation condition (n = 11) or a control condition (n = 8). Athree-phase reversal learning decision task was administered at baseline, and again after 30.5 h of sleep deprivation, or matching well-rested control. The task was based on a go/no go task paradigm, in which stimuli were assigned to either a go (response) set or a no go (no response) set. Each phase of the task included four stimuli (two in the go set and two in the no go set). After each stimulus presentation, subjects could make a response within 750 ms or withhold their response. They were then shown feedback on the accuracy of their response. In phase 1 of the task, subjects were explicitly told which stimuli were assigned to the go and no go sets. In phases 2 and 3, new stimuli were used that were different from those used in phase 1. Subjects were not explicitly told the go/no go mappings and were instead required to use accuracy feedback to learn which stimuli were in the go and nogo sets. Phase 3 continued directly from phase 2 and retained the same stimuli as in phase 2, but there was an unannounced reversal of the stimulus-response mappings. Task results confirmed that sleep deprivation resulted in loss of cognitive flexibility through feedback blunting, and that this effect was not produced solely by (1) general performance impairment because of overwhelming sleep drive; (2) reduced working memory resources available to perform the task; (3) incomplete learning of stimulus-response mappings before the unannounced reversal; or (4) interference with stimulus identification through lapses in vigilant attention. Overall, the results suggest that sleep deprivation causes a fundamental problem with dynamic attentional control. This element of performance impairment due to sleep deprivation appears to be distinct from vigilant attention deficits, and represents a particularly significant challenge for fatigue risk management.}

The present study investigated sleep/wake cycles and fatigue levels in 22 nurses working 12-h shifts, comparing day versus night shifts. Nurses (11day shift and 11 night shift) were recruited from a suburban acute-care medical center. Participants wore a wrist activity monitor and kept a diary to track their sleep/wake cycles for 2 weeks. They also completed a fatigue test battery, which included the Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), at the beginning, middle and end of 4 duty shifts. Daily sleep duration was 7.1h on average. No overall difference in mean daily sleep duration was found between nurses working day shifts versus night shifts. Objective performance on the PVT remained relatively good and stable at the start, middle, and end of duty shifts in day shift workers, but gradually degraded across duty time in night shift workers. Compared to day shift workers, night shift workers also exhibited more performance variability among measurement days and between participants at each testing time point. The same pattern was observed for subjective sleepiness on the KSS. However, congruence between objective and subjective measures of fatigue was poor. Our findings suggest a need for organizations to evaluate practices and policies to mitigate the inevitable fatigue that occurs during long night shifts, in order to improve patient and healthcare worker safety. Examination of alternative shift lengths or sanctioned workplace napping may be strategies to consider.}

This is relevant for manual driving and, paradoxically, even more so with increasing levels of driving automation. Measures available for drowsiness detection vary in reliability, validity, usability, and effectiveness. Passively recorded physiologic measures such as electroencephalography (EEG) and a variety of ocular parameters tend to accurately identify states of considerable drowsiness, but are limited in their potential to detect lower levels of drowsiness. They also do not correlate well with measures of driver performance. Objective measures of vigilant attention performance capture drowsiness reliably, but they require active driver involvement in a performance task and are prone to confounds from distraction and (lack of) motivation. Embedded performance measures of actual driving, such as lane deviation, have been found to correlate with physiologic and vigilance performance measures, yet to what extent drowsiness levels can be derived from them reliably remains a topic of investigation. Transient effects from external circumstances and behaviors – such as task load, light exposure, physical activity, and caffeine intake – may mask a driver’s underlying state of drowsiness. Also, drivers differ in the degree to which drowsiness affects their driving performance, based on trait vulnerability as well as age. This paper provides a broad overview of the current science pertinent to a range of drowsiness measures, with an emphasis on those that may be most relevant for CMV operations. There is a need for smart technologies that in a transparent manner combine different measurement modalities with mathematical representations of the neurobiological processes driving drowsiness, that account for various mediators and confounds, and that are appropriately adapted to the individual driver. The research for and development of such technologies requires a multi-disciplinary approach and significant resources, but is technically within reach.}

This study aims to determine whether the standard sources of information used to detect drowsiness can also be used to predict when a given drowsiness level will be reached. Moreover, we explore whether adding data such as driving time and participant information improves the accuracy of detection and prediction of drowsiness. Twenty-one participants drove a car simulator for 110min under conditions optimized to induce drowsiness. We measured physiological and behavioral indicators such as heart rate and variability, respiration rate, head and eyelid movements (blink duration, frequency and PERCLOS) and recorded driving behavior such as time-to-lane-crossing, speed, steering wheel angle, position on the lane. Different combinations of this information were tested against the real state of the driver, namely the ground truth, as defined from video recordings via the Trained Observer Rating. Two models using artificial neural networks were developed, one to detect the degree of drowsiness every minute, and the other to predict every minute the time required to reach a particular drowsiness level (moderately drowsy). The best performance in both detection and prediction is obtained with behavioral indicators and additional information. The model can detect the drowsiness level with a mean square error of 0.22 and can predict when a given drowsiness level will be reached with a mean square error of 4.18min. This study shows that, on a controlled and very monotonous environment conducive to drowsiness in a driving simulator, the dynamics of driver impairment can be predicted.}

Worker fatigue has been identified as one of the main contributing factors. Currently no independent and objective large data source is available that might support an analysis of this, or provide the basis for ongoing monitoring to further investigate. In order to successfully manage fatigue in the forestry workplace, we must identify suitable ways of detecting it. Industry partners are increasingly looking at monitoring solutions (particularly lightweight, wearable technology) that aim to measure worker activities and physiological metrics in order to determine if they are fatigued. In this article we present the results of studies which investigate whether or not such technology can capture meaningful data in a reliable way that is both practical and usable within the forestry domain. Two series of studies were undertaken with in-situ forestry workers using reaction and decision-making times as a measure of potential impairment, while considering activity levels (via step count and heart rate) and job-roles. We present the results of these studies and further provide a comparison of results across different ambient temperatures (winter vs. summer periods). The results of our studies suggest that it may not be possible to identify correlations between workloads (based on both physical and cognitive stresses) and fatigue measures using in-situ measurements as results are highly personalised to individual workers and can be misleading if the wider context is not also taken into consideration.}

abstract = {Introduction
There is ongoing concern at the national level about the availability of adequate commercial vehicle rest areas and truck stops for commercial vehicle drivers to rest or to wait for a delivery window.
Methods
A retrospective case-control study was conducted to determine the association between the occurrence of sleepiness/fatigue-related (cases) vs. all other human factor-related commercial vehicle driver at-fault crashes (controls) and proximity to rest areas, weigh stations with rest havens, and truck stops.
Results
Commercial vehicle driver at-fault crashes involving sleepiness/fatigue were more likely to occur on roadways where the nearest rest areas/weigh stations with rest havens/truck stops were located 20 miles or more from the commercial vehicle crash site (Odds Ratio [OR]=2.32; Confidence Interval [CI] 1.615, 3.335] for 20–39.9 miles vs. <20 miles; and OR=6.788 [CI 2.112, 21.812] for 40+ miles) compared to commercial vehicle at-fault driver crashes with human factors other than sleepiness/fatigue cited in crash reports. Commercial vehicle driver at-fault crashes involving sleepiness/fatigue also were more likely to occur on parkways compared to interstates (adjusted OR=3.747 [CI 2.83, 4.95]), during nighttime hours (adjusted OR=6.199 [CI 4.733, 8.119]), and on dry pavement (adjusted OR 1.909, [CI 1.373, 2.655]).
Conclusions
The use of statewide crash data analysis coupled with ArcGIS mapping capabilities provided the opportunity to both statistically determine and to visualize the association between rest area/weigh station with rest haven/truck stop distance and the occurrence of commercial vehicle driver at-fault crashes involving sleepiness/fatigue. Implementation and evaluation of commercial vehicle employer policies and interventions such as the use of commercial vehicle driver fatigue alert systems may help to reduce fatigue and sleepiness in commercial vehicle drivers. These results can be used by state and local highway transportation officials to inform and increase truck parking availability, especially on parkways.}

abstract = {Introduction
Shifting school start times to 8:30 am or later has been found to improve academic performance and reduce behavior problems. Limited research suggests this may also reduce adolescent driver motor vehicle crashes. A change in the school start time from 7:30 am to 8:45 am for all public high schools in one North Carolina county presented the opportunity to address this question with greater methodologic rigor.
Method
We conducted ARIMA interrupted time-series analyses to examine motor vehicle crash rates of high school age drivers in the intervention county and 3 similar comparison counties with comparable urban-rural population distribution. To focus on crashes most likely to be affected, we limited analysis to crashes involving 16- \& 17-year-old drivers occurring on days when school was in session.
Results
In the intervention county, there was a 14% downward shift in the time-series following the 75 min delay in school start times (p = .076). There was no change approaching statistical significance in any of the other three counties. Further analysis indicated marked, statistically significant shifts in hourly crash rates in the intervention county, reflecting effects of the change in school start time on young driver exposure. Crashes from 7 to 7:59 am decreased sharply (−25%, p = .008), but increased similarly from 8 to 8:59 am (21%, p = .004). Crashes from 2 to 2:59 pm declined dramatically (−48%, p = .000), then increased to a lesser degree from 3 to 3:59 pm (32%, p = .024) and non-significantly from 4 to 4:59 (19%, p = .102). There was no meaningful change in early morning or nighttime crashes, when drowsiness-induced crashes might have been expected to be most common.
Discussion
The small decrease in crashes among high school age drivers following the shift in school start time is consistent with the findings of other studies of teen driver crashes and school start times. All these studies, including the present one, have limitations, but the similar findings suggest that crashes and school start times are indeed related, with earlier start times equating to more crashes.
Conclusion
Later high school start times (>8:30 am) appear to be associated with lower adolescent driver crash rates, but additional research is needed to confirm this and to identify the mechanism by which this occurs (reduced drowsiness or reduced exposure).}

Data were collected using questionnaires (including the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF [WHOQOL-BREF], General Health Questionnaire [GHQ-12] and Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory [MFI-20] for evaluation of QoL, mental health problems and fatigue, respectively) from 990 Iranian hospital nurses, and analysed by generalized structural equation modelling (GSEM). The results indicated that QoL, mental health problems and fatigue were interrelated, and supported the direct and indirect (through fatigue) effects of QoL on mental health problems. All domains of the WHOQOL-BREF, and particularly physical (sleep problems), psychological (negative feelings) and environmental health (leisure activities) domains, were strongly related to the mental health status of the studied nurses. Fatigue and its multiple dimensions partially mediated the relationship between QoL and mental health problems. The results highlighted the importance of physical, psychological and environmental aspects of QoL and suggested the need for potential interventions to improve fatigue (particularly physical fatigue along with mental fatigue) and consequently mental health status of this working population. The findings have possible implications for nurses' health and patient safety outcomes.}

Driver distraction occurs when inattention leads to a delay in recognition of information necessary to accomplish the driving task. Two recent studies were conducted using a naturalistic data collection method and analysis of driver distraction. The Commercial Motor Vehicle Driver Distraction study (Olson et al., 2009) was conducted using heavy truck data, and the Distraction and Drowsiness in Motorcoach Drivers study (Hammond et al., 2016) was conducted using motorcoach data. Data were collected continuously every time the instrumented vehicle was turned on and in motion. Data were reduced to identify safety-critical events such as crashes, near-crashes, crash-relevant conflicts, and unintentional lane deviations. Results show that 40% of truck crashes and 56% of motorcoach crashes had some kind of distracting behavior. Odds ratios were calculated on individual secondary tasks and analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were calculated on eye-glance data to determine the effects of eyes off the forward roadway. Fewer distractions were identified in the motorcoach data, most notably the use of handheld cell phones. This suggests that the 2010 ban on handheld phones has had a positive effect on decreasing cell phone use while driving.}

Despite this risk, there is little research concerning the prevalence of winter maintenance operator fatigue during winter emergencies. The purpose of this research was to investigate the prevalence, sources, and countermeasures of fatigue in winter maintenance operations. Questionnaires from 1043 winter maintenance operators and 453 managers were received from 29 Clear Road member states. Results confirmed that fatigue was prevalent in winter maintenance operations. Over 70% of the operators and managers believed that fatigue has a moderate to significant impact on winter maintenance operations. Approximately 75% of winter maintenance operators reported to at least sometimes drive while fatigued, and 96% of managers believed their winter maintenance operators drove while fatigued at least some of the time. Furthermore, winter maintenance operators and managers identified fatigue countermeasures and sources of fatigue related to winter maintenance equipment. However, the countermeasures believed to be the most effective at reducing fatigue during winter emergencies (i.e., naps) were underutilized. For example, winter maintenance operators reported to never use naps to eliminate fatigue. These results indicated winter maintenance operations are impacted by operator fatigue. These results support the increased need for research and effective countermeasures targeting winter maintenance operator fatigue.}

abstract = {In December 2014, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) completed a major revision of the rules and regulations governing flight and duty time in commercial aviation (Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 117). Scientists were included in the revision process and provided insights into sleep, sleep loss, the circadian rhythm, and their effects on performance that were incorporated into the new rule. If a planned flight was non-compliant with the regulation, for example if it exceeded flight and duty time limits, it could only be flown under an FAA-approved Fatigue Risk Management System (FRMS) as meeting an Alternative Method of Compliance (AMOC). One method that a flight could qualify as an AMOC is if it could be demonstrated empirically that it was as safe as or safer than a similar flight, designated the Safety Standard Operation (SSO), that was compliant with the regulation. In the present paper, we demonstrate the FRMS process using a comparison between a non-compliant AMOC flight from the US west coast to Australia and a compliant SSO flight from the US west coast to Taiwan. The AMOC was non-compliant because it exceeded the flight time limits in the prescriptive rule. Once a data collection exemption was granted by the FAA, both the outbound and inbound AMOC and SSO routes were studied on four Safety Performance Indicators (SPIs). The SPIs studied were inflight sleep, cognitive performance, self-reported fatigue, and self-reported sleepiness. These measures were made at top of descent (TOD), a critical phase of flight. The study was designed as a paired comparison. Forty volunteer pilots studied flew both the AMOC and the SSO flights for a total of 80 studied flights. Using statistical non-inferiority applied to the AMOC and SSO SPIs, we demonstrated, as required by the new rule, that the US-Australia AMOC flight was “as safe as, or safer than” the US-Taiwan SSO flight. In the context of FRMS, statistical non-inferiority is a concept and technique of great utility, straightforward in application, producing clear visual representations of the findings, and providing a direct answer to the question posed by the regulation - is the AMOC flight "as safe as, or safer than” the SSO.}

However, discrepancies between subjective and objective measures have increased interest in physiological assessment of performance. In a double-blind placebo-controlled study, 23 healthy adults were randomly assigned to either a placebo (n = 11; 5 F, 6 M) or caffeine condition (n = 12; 4 F, 8 M) while undergoing 50 h (i.e. two days) of total sleep deprivation. In previous work, higher salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) levels were associated with improved psychomotor vigilance and simulated driving performance in the placebo condition. In this follow-up article, the effects of strategic caffeine administration on the previously reported diurnal profiles of sAA and performance, and the association between sAA and neurobehavioural performance were investigated. Participants were given a 10 h baseline sleep opportunity (monitored via standard polysomnography techniques) prior to undergoing sleep deprivation (total sleep time: placebo = 8.83 ± 0.48 h; caffeine = 9.01 ± 0.48 h). During sleep deprivation, caffeine gum (200 mg) was administered at 01:00 h, 03:00 h, 05:00 h, and 07:00 h to participants in the caffeine condition (n = 12). This strategic administration of caffeine gum (200 mg) has been shown to be effective at maintaining cognitive performance during extended wakefulness. Saliva samples were collected, and psychomotor vigilance and simulated driving performance assessed at three-hour intervals throughout wakefulness. Caffeine effects on diurnal variability were compared with previously reported findings in the placebo condition (n = 11). The impact of caffeine on the circadian profile of sAA coincided with changes in neurobehavioural performance. Higher sAA levels were associated with improved performance on the psychomotor vigilance test during the first 24 h of wakefulness in the caffeine condition. However, only the association between sAA and response speed (i.e. reciprocal-transform of mean reaction time) was consistent across both days of sleep deprivation. The association between sAA and driving performance was not consistent across both days of sleep deprivation. Results show that the relationship between sAA and reciprocal-transform of mean reaction time on the psychomotor vigilance test persisted in the presence of caffeine, however the association was relatively weaker as compared with the placebo condition.}

abstract = {Due to the lack of active involvement in the driving situation and due to monotonous driving environments drivers with automation may be prone to become fatigued faster than manual drivers (e.g. Schömig et al., 2015). However, little is known about the progression of fatigue during automated driving and its effects on the ability to take back manual control after a take-over request. In this driving simulator study with Nö=ö60 drivers we used a three factorial 2ö×ö2ö×ö12 mixed design to analyze the progression (12ö×ö5ömin; within subjects) of driver fatigue in drivers with automation compared to manual drivers (between subjects). Driver fatigue was induced as either mainly sleep related or mainly task related fatigue (between subjects). Additionally, we investigated the drivers’ reactions to a take-over request in a critical driving scenario to gain insights into the ability of fatigued drivers to regain manual control and situation awareness after automated driving. Drivers in the automated driving condition exhibited facial indicators of fatigue after 15 to 35ömin of driving. Manual drivers only showed similar indicators of fatigue if they suffered from a lack of sleep and then only after a longer period of driving (approx. 40ömin). Several drivers in the automated condition closed their eyes for extended periods of time. In the driving with automation condition mean automation deactivation times after a take-over request were slower for a certain percentage (about 30%) of the drivers with a lack of sleep (Mö=ö3.2; SDö=ö2.1ös) compared to the reaction times after a long drive (Mö=ö2.4; SDö=ö0.9ös). Drivers with automation also took longer than manual drivers to first glance at the speed display after a take-over request and were more likely to stay behind a braking lead vehicle instead of overtaking it. Drivers are unable to stay alert during extended periods of automated driving without non-driving related tasks. Fatigued drivers could pose a serious hazard in complex take-over situations where situation awareness is required to prepare for threats. Driver fatigue monitoring or controllable distraction through non-driving tasks could be necessary to ensure alertness and availability during highly automated driving.}

abstract = {Driving on monotonous roads has been shown to cause passive fatigue as even non-sleep-deprived drivers suffer from the lack of stimuli. Consequently, alertness is reduced and the risk of accidents increases. To counteract this risk, measures need to be taken to mitigate driver fatigue. While in the past, some studies have been focused on the potential of thermal stimuli to reduce fatigue, their results seem inconclusive. Examining the study conditions in which the thermal stimuli were studied, it becomes obvious that the duration of the thermal stimulus strongly affects perceived fatigue. To better understand this relation, a driving simulator study (n=33) was conducted investigating both a 2min and a 4min thermal stimulus (15öC), where air was circulated on non-sleep-deprived drivers. For the 4min stimulus, patterns of increased sympathetic activity (i.e. significant pupil dilatation and bradycardia) were recorded. Furthermore, participants subjectively rated fatigue significantly lower when the stimuli were applied, and preferred driving with the stimulus. The superior performance of the 4min stimulus can be derived from a longer effect on the physiological data as well as even lower subjective fatigue ratings. Results also point to the limits of thermal stimulation: 6min after the stimuli, the participants no longer feel an effect (based on subjective ratings). Future research on passive fatigue countermeasures should hence build on the identified effect of a 4min cooling stimulus to increase physiological arousal and focus on the opportunities to increase effect duration.}

This article reviews the authors’ simulation studies of how fatigue, automation, and distraction may intersect as threats to safety. Distinguishing between states of active and passive fatigue supports understanding of fatigue and the development of countermeasures. Active fatigue is a stress-like state driven by overload of cognitive capabilities. Passive fatigue is produced by underload and monotony, and is associated with loss of task engagement and alertness. Our studies show that automated driving reliably elicits subjective symptoms of passive fatigue and also loss of alertness that persists following manual takeover. Passive fatigue also impairs attention and automation use in operators of Remotely Piloted Vehicles (RPVs). Use of in-vehicle media has been proposed as a countermeasure to fatigue, but such media may also be distracting. Studies tested whether various forms of phone-based media interacted with automation-induced fatigue, but effects were complex and dependent on task configuration. Selection of fatigue countermeasures should be guided by an understanding of the form of fatigue confronting the operator. System design, regulation of level of automation, managing distraction, and selection of fatigue-resilient personnel are all possible interventions for passive fatigue, but careful evaluation of interventions is necessary prior to deployment.}

The purpose of this study was to compare a psychomotor vigilance task developed for use on touchscreen devices with the original PVT-192 in conditions of acute sleep loss and circadian desynchronization.
Background
The Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) is considered the gold standard fatigue detection test and is used frequently in fatigue research. With the rapid development of new technologies it is essential to develop a PVT available on different platforms such as touchscreen devices. The advantage of such PVT is that it can be implemented on small devices and can be easily used in field studies.
Methods
Ten participants completed a 5-min PVT (NASA-PVT) on a touchscreen device and a 5-min PVT on the original PVT-192. On the day of the experiment, participants arrived in the lab approximately two hours after their habitual wake time. Participants completed a constant routine protocol under dim lighting, while maintaining a constant posture. The 5-min PVT-192 and NASA-PVT were taken every two hours for at least 24h.
Results
The NASA-PVT and PVT-192 were sensitive to extended wakefulness in the same manner. The reaction times were slower and the lapses were higher as time progressed on both NASA-PVT and PVT-192 (p<0.001). Overall, there was a sharp decline in performance after 16h of being awake which coincided with the time the participants were usually going to bed and the worst performance occurred after 24h of wakefulness for both PVTs (p<0.001).
Conclusions
Overall, our data suggest that the NASA-PVT is a valid tool for assessing fatigue in field studies.}

Mobile device use while crossing the street has been associated with unsafe crossing behaviors and gait abnormalities, potentially increasing the risk of pedestrian injury or death. Expanding upon the small body of literature, the present study utilized the theory of planned behavior to guide the development of a questionnaire used to collect data from 480 adults on predictors of intentions to use a mobile device while crossing the street. Questionnaire development involved one round of expert panel review (N = 4), subsequent pilot testing of a revised questionnaire, and a test-retest reliability assessment. Results demonstrate that attitude toward the behavior, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control significantly predicted the intention to use a mobile device while crossing the street in this population. Such a questionnaire can be used in the design and evaluation of TPB-based interventions to decrease distracted mobile device use while crossing the street.}

abstract = {Connected and automated vehicles have enabled researchers to use big data for development of new metrics that can enhance transportation safety. Emergence of such a big data coupled with computational power of modern computers have enabled us to obtain deeper understanding of instantaneous driving behavior by applying the concept of “driving volatility” to quantify variations in driving behavior. This paper brings in a methodology to quantify variations in vehicular movements utilizing longitudinal and lateral volatilities and proactively studies the impact of instantaneous driving behavior on type of crashes at intersections. More than 125 million Basic Safety Message data transmitted between more than 2800 connected vehicles were analyzed and integrated with historical crash and road inventory data at 167 intersections in Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA. Given that driving volatility represents the vehicular movement and control, it is expected that erratic longitudinal/lateral movements increase the risk of crash. In order to capture variations in vehicle control and movement, we quantified and used 30 measures of driving volatility by using speed, longitudinal and lateral acceleration, and yaw-rate. Rigorous statistical models including fixed parameter, random parameter, and geographically weighted Poisson regressions were developed. The results revealed that controlling for intersection geometry and traffic exposure, and accounting unobserved factors, variations in longitudinal control of the vehicle (longitudinal volatility) are highly correlated with the frequency of rear-end crashes. Intersections with high variations in longitudinal movement are prone to have higher rear-end crash rate. Referring to sideswipe and angle crashes, along with speed and longitudinal volatility, lateral volatility is substantially correlated with the frequency of crashes. When it comes to head-on crashes, speed, longitudinal and lateral acceleration volatilities are highly associated with the frequency of crashes. Intersections with high lateral volatility have higher risk of head-on collisions due to the risk of deviation from the centerline leading to head-on crash. The developed methodology and volatility measures can be used to proactively identify hotspot intersections where the frequency of crashes is low, but the longitudinal/lateral driving volatility is high. The reason that drivers exhibit higher levels of driving volatility when passing these intersections can be analyzed to come up with potential countermeasures that could reduce volatility and, consequently, crash risk.}

While helmet development and mandatory wearing have reduced head injuries, little progress has been made regarding trunk protection. Wearable airbag devices represent a promising solution to prevent trunk injuries. Nevertheless, research investigations need to be performed to assess and optimise the efficiency of such devices. This work consisted in the analysis of motorcyclist trunk impact conditions involved in various crash configurations to provide critical information in order to evaluate and improve the performances of airbag devices. First, an epidemiological and an accidentological analysis of data collection related to 252 real accidents, focusing on victims admitted into the shock rooms of two French trauma centres were performed. The data obtained was combined with numerical multibody parametric investigations, allowing the reproduction of 240 accident situations. An original and representative analysis of motorcyclists’ impact conditions was provided, weighting the numerical study output data according to the real accident database. The impacted regions of the human body, the impact velocity and the accident chronology obtained in this work made it possible to define critical information for airbag efficiency assessment: the zones and levels of protection, the impacted surfaces as well as the airbag intervention time and the duration of maintained inflation of the airbag.}

Many of these designs are not consistent with current traffic and pedestrian demands anymore. Therefore, this inconsistency has caused problems regarding operation and safety. This paper models safety performance of a new design called super diverging diamond interchange (super DDI) considering VISSIM simulation and surrogate safety assessment model (SSAM). Six other interchange designs were also considered for comparing to the new super DDI design. Overall, 252 simulation scenarios were modeled in VISSIM and then tested by SSAM. Also, the same number of tests were considered to evaluate pedestrian performance of the designs considered in this study. Based on results, super DDI showed a high potential either in terms of traffic safety and pedestrian safety. In comparison to other designs, super DDI had the minimum number of simulated conflicts as well as the lowest mean speed and time to collision (TTC) of simulated conflicts. This fact shows that super DDI could perform promising in reducing crash frequency and crash severity. Reviewing the geometry of the super DDI, lower traffic involving in each conflict point should be one of the main reasons for the promising traffic safety performance of the design. Regarding pedestrian performance, super DDI got the third rank of the lowest mean pedestrian travel times. There is no free-flowing conflict between vehicles and pedestrians in a super DDI. Therefore, pedestrian paths of the super DDI are predicted to be safer than the paths in a typical DDI design.}

Age-related cognitive decline is frequently cited as the main cause of unsafe driving performance in older drivers. Objective: The present study investigated how executive functions (EFs), measured as latent variables, are related to on-road driving performance during aging. Method: One hundred and twenty-six participants aged from twenty to eighty-two, completed a two hundred and forty-seven km on-road driving test and a set of executive tasks selected to tap three often postulated EFs: inhibition (inhibiting prepotent responses), updating (updating working memory representations), and shifting (shifting task sets). Results: Confirmatory factor analysis reproduces previous results obtained by Miyake et al. (2000), Miyake and Friedman (2012) of unity and diversity of EFs in an adult life span sample. Structural equation modeling suggested that on-road driving performance was related to inhibition. Furthermore, findings indicate that the age-related driving performance decline in normal aging may be mediated by the inhibition function. Conclusions: The results highlight the importance of a proper method to assess executive functioning in a specific domain as well as emphasising the major role of those functions in driving performance while aging.}

Ten years after the advent of the first Lei Seca this study set out to make a quantitative assessment of the two laws’ impacts regarding the reduction of lethal traffic accidents in the Federal District, Brazil. Intervention Analysis of Time Series was the technique used and transfer functions enabled the incorporation of the effects of dummy exogenous variables to the Box and Jenkins ARIMA model. Results showed that while Law n° 11.705 had no significant impact, Law 12.760 did have a statistically significant impact in reducing lethal accidents. Such results underscore the need for ex post monitoring and evaluation of Laws and confirm the premise that legislation only successfully produces its effects when compliance can be enforced.}

To examine associations between internalizing symptoms and self-reported aberrant driving behaviors in a large sample (n = 341) of older adults (mean age = 62.6 years, SD = 4.8).
Design
Cross-sectional survey.
Results
Multiple regression analyses revealed that greater symptoms of emotional distress (i.e., higher scores on the Expanded Version of the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS-II) emotional distress composite) were associated with greater aberrant driving behaviors (i.e., higher scores on the Driving Behavior Questionnaire). In contrast, neither obsessions/fears nor emotional well-being were associated with greater aberrant driving behaviors. Follow-up regression analyses examining specific IDAS-II subscales revealed that greater suicidality, appetite gain, appetite loss, panic, and ill temper were associated with greater aberrant driving behaviors. Individuals reporting greater suicidality and appetite loss reported greater tendencies to unintentionally commit errors behind the wheel, while individuals reporting greater ill temper and appetite loss reported greater tendencies to intentionally engage in unsafe driving behaviors that may put other drivers in harm’s way.
Conclusion
Older adults reporting emotional distress may be at risk for engaging in aberrant driving behaviors. In particular, certain symptoms of emotional distress (e.g., suicidality, ill temper) are tied to higher rates of aberrant driving behaviors within this population.}

abstract = {Objective
A driving simulator study was conducted to investigate the effect of cognitive distraction on different stages of perception-response time (saccade latency, processing time, and movement time) to unexpected roadway hazards, both when the hazard onset is abrupt and when it is gradual.
Background
Prior studies, which typically focus on overall response times, have demonstrated that distraction, including cognitive distraction, leads to an increase in response times. Studies have also shown that response times differ depending on the type and location of the hazard. However, there is limited research into the effect of cognitive distraction for gradually developing hazards (e.g., a left-turn across path vehicle), as existing research primarily focuses on abrupt hazard onsets (e.g., lead vehicle braking).
Method
Twenty-four participants were presented with three different emergency roadway hazards, including one abrupt onset hazard (a pedestrian stepping onto the roadway from in front of a parked vehicle) and two gradually developing hazards (an oncoming vehicle turning left across the driver’s path and a vehicle accelerating perpendicularly into the driver’s path from the right). Half of the participants completed a delayed digit recall task (cognitive distraction condition), the other half did not (control condition).
Results
The left-turn across path hazard was particularly characterized by the long processing period (initiation of the saccade towards the hazard to initial motor response), whereas the pedestrian hazard was more notable for the shortest saccadic latency (hazard onset to the start of the saccade towards the hazard). Cognitive distraction led to a significant increase in brake reaction time for the right-incursion vehicle hazard, in processing time for the left-turn across path hazard, and a marginally significant increase in saccadic latency for the pedestrian and right-incursion vehicle hazards.
Conclusion
Hazard ambiguity due to gradual onset, such as with the left-turn across path hazard, appears to increase the processing duration before a response is executed, especially when distracted. Abrupt hazard onset appears to induce shorter saccadic latencies than gradual onsets likely due to a stronger attentional capture property. However, cognitive distraction may increase saccadic latencies for these types of hazards.}

While current studies mainly use variants of count data regression to achieve this aim, the problem can also be considered as a binary classification task, with the dichotomous target variable indicating events (accidents) and non-events (no accidents). The effects of 45 variables – describing road condition and geometry, traffic volume and regulations, weather, and accident time – are analyzed using a dataset in high temporal (1 h) and spatial (250 m) resolution, covering the whole highway network of Austria over the period of four consecutive years. A combination of synthetic minority oversampling and maximum dissimilarity undersampling is used to balance the training dataset. We employ and compare a series of statistical learning techniques with respect to their predictive performance and discuss the importance of determining factors of accident occurrence from the ensemble of models. Findings substantiate that a trade-off between accuracy and sensitivity is inherent to imbalanced classification problems. Results show satisfying performance of tree-based methods which exhibit accuracies between 75% and 90% while exhibiting sensitivities between 30% and 50%. Overall, this analysis emphasizes the merits of using high-resolution data in the context of accident analysis.}

The crash data from Kaiyang Freeway, China in 2014 are collected for the analysis, where crash severity levels are defined considering the combination of injury severity, financial loss, and numbers of injuries and deaths. We calibrate the proposed spatial model and compare it with a traditional generalized ordered logit model via Bayesian inference. The superiority of the spatial model is indicated by its better model fit and the statistical significance of the spatial term. Estimation results show that driver type, season, traffic volume and composition, response time for emergency medical services, and crash type have significant effects on crash severity propensity. In addition, vehicle type, season, time of day, weather condition, vertical grade, bridge, traffic volume and composition, and crash type have significant impacts on the threshold between median and severe crash levels. The average marginal effects of the contributing factors on each crash severity level are also calculated. Based on the estimation results, several countermeasures regarding driver education, traffic rule enforcement, vehicle and roadway engineering, and emergency services are proposed to mitigate freeway crash severity.}

abstract = {Real-time risk assessment of autonomous driving at tactical and operational levels is extremely challenging since both contextual and circumferential factors should concurrently be considered. Recent methods have started to simultaneously treat the context of the traffic environment along with vehicle dynamics. In particular, interaction-aware motion models that take inter-vehicle dependencies into account by utilizing the Bayesian interference are employed to mutually control multiple factors. However, communications between vehicles are often assumed and the developed models are required many parameters to be tuned. Consequently, they are computationally very demanding. Even in the cases where these desiderata are fulfilled, current approaches cannot cope with a large volume of sequential data from organically changing traffic scenarios, especially in highly complex operational environments such as dense urban areas with heterogeneous road users. To overcome these limitations, this paper develops a new risk assessment methodology that integrates a network-level collision estimate with a vehicle-based risk estimate in real-time under the joint framework of interaction-aware motion models and Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN). Following the formulation and explanation of the required functions, machine learning classifiers were utilized for the real-time network-level collision prediction and the results were then incorporated into the integrated DBN model for predicting collision probabilities in real-time. Results indicated an enhancement of the interaction-aware model by up to 10%, when traffic conditions are deemed as collision-prone. Hence, it was concluded that a well-calibrated collision prediction classifier provides a crucial hint for better risk perception by autonomous vehicles.}

We sent paper and pencil questionnaires to five thousand low-risk drivers and five thousand high-risk drivers randomly selected based on their driving records. A driver who has been convicted of two or more traffic infractions with demerit points (e.g., exceeding speed limits, red light violation, no seatbelt, etc.) in the last two years was considered a high-risk driver whereas a low-risk driver had no traffic offense registered in his driving record in the last four years. We received two thousand and sixty-four completed questionnaires for a response rate of 20.6%. Seven hundred and ninety-eight belonged to the group of high-risk drivers and one thousand two hundred and sixty-six to the group of low-risk drivers. The results show that a promotion focused orientation, a present hedonistic perspective, an internal locus of control, and sensation seeking are associated with more risky driving behaviors and could therefore distinguish between high-risk and low-risk drivers. These results increase the understanding of risky drivers’ personalities and motivations. The literature review provides insight into how these findings might be considered in developing more effective road safety programs and campaigns, and the conclusion encourages researchers to explore these new avenues in future research.}

abstract = {Past research has shown that winter precipitation is an important environmental factor that increases the frequency of motor vehicle collisions that cause personal injury and property damage. Questions remain about the magnitude of winter storm effects on collision occurrence, changes in risk over time, and the role of driver behaviour in conjunction with other factors (e.g., winter maintenance by road authorities) as it affects exposure and sensitivity to hazardous conditions. In response, a matched-pair, retrospective cohort method was used to estimate injury and non-injury collision risks for a mid-sized urban community based on a new definition of winter storm events that, relative to previous studies, captures a greater portion of time during which drivers respond to hazardous weather and road surface conditions. Winter storm definition criteria were applied to weather radar imagery and traditional surface station observations in a unique manner to classify and characterize a set of 196 variable-length storm events in terms of precipitation type and amount, visibility, temperature profile, presence of government-issued warnings, location, and temporal factors. Injury and non-injury collisions increased by 66 and 137 percent, respectively, during winter storms relative to dry weather conditions. Although these increases were higher than findings from similar studies of winter precipitation events conducted over the same timeframe (i.e., 2002–2016), they were found to have declined by a statistically significant amount over the course of the study period and disproportionately to collisions in general. Understanding why this is occurring, and then attributing improvements to specific winter road safety interventions and behavioural adjustments, is a key focus for future research and for informing future risk-mitigating investments.}

abstract = {Objective
There is a lack of knowledge regarding sickness absence (SA) and disability pension (DP) as consequences of road traffic injuries, and on the association between DP and permanent medical impairment (PMI). Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate SA, DP, and PMI among injured passenger car occupants two years after a crash, and how they are associated, accounting for sociodemographics, crash-related factors, and previous SA/DP.
Methods
This prospective cohort study included 64 007 injured car occupants aged 17–62 years at the time of a crash occurring in 2001–2013, involving a car insured at Folksam Insurance Group in Sweden. Information on sociodemographics, crash-related factors, SA (in SA spells >14 days) and DP status at inclusion and at two-year follow-up, and PMI assessed by the insurance company was used. PMI grades were categorized as 1–4, 5–9, 10–19, or >19%. Logistic regression was performed to calculate odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for DP at follow-up and for PMI, respectively.
Results
At the time of the crash 13% were already on SA or DP. At follow-up two years after the crash, 6% among those not already on SA/DP at the time of the crash were on SA and 2% on DP. Furthermore, 8% of the total cohort had a determined PMI. Among those not already on DP at the crash, 3% with no PMI had DP at follow-up. This proportion was higher the higher PMI grade. Among individuals without already ongoing DP at the crash date, 10% of those with a PMI 1–4 ha d DP, compared to 76% among PMI ≥ 20. Already ongoing SA at the time of the crash (OR = 39.16, 95% CI 34.89–43.95) and PMI grade (PMI ≥ 5 OR = 27.44, 95% CI 23.88–31.52, reference group PMI 0) were found to be associated with DP at two years after crash. The factor most strongly associated with PMI was the model year of the car. The older the car, the higher the risk of PMI (Model year ≤ 1990 OR = 3.36, 95% CI 2.67–4.23, reference group model year 2006–2010). An association with the same direction was also found between the model year of the car and DP at follow-up.
Conclusions
The association between PMI grade and DP status at follow-up among occupants not on DP at the crash date indicates that both could be used to measure long-term consequences of road traffic injury. In this cohort, already ongoing SA at the crash date was associated with DP at the two-year follow-up, emphasizing the importance of accounting for this factor in future research.}

abstract = {Road crash occurrence is closely related to the geometric design consistency, which can be defined as how drivers’ expectancies and road behavior fit. To this regard, the crash rate on a road segment increases as its consistency level decreases. To assess this phenomenon, inertial consistency models were recently developed. These models are based on the difference between the inertial operating speed, which represents drivers’ expectancies, and the operating speed, which represents road behavior. The higher the difference between both speeds, the higher the likelihood of crash occurrence. This research aims to validate and calibrate these consistency models on American two-lane rural roads. For this, a total of 194 homogeneous road segments and 977 horizontal curves along 665 km in North Carolina (US) were used. As a result, the geometric design consistency was identified as a major factor of crash occurrence. The higher the difference between drivers’ expectancies and road behavior, the higher the crash rate. Likewise, the greater the consistency level, the greater the percentage of horizontal curves without reported crashes. A Safety Performance Function was also calibrated to estimate the number of crashes on a road segment. Consistency thresholds were defined and tested to identify where these crashes are more likely to take place. Finally, the results obtained in this study were compared with those obtained previously on Spanish highways. To this regard, the crash rate on an American highway was 1.85 times greater than those observed on a Spanish highway under the same risk exposure and consistency conditions. Therefore, different tools were developed to enhance the assessment of road safety to the geometric design of both new two-lane rural roads and improvements of existing highways.}

Previous research generally paid attentions to the influences of specific road characteristics (e.g. curvature) on driving behaviors. Limited studies have focused on how drivers identify different alignments and how they further take the varying speed choices. This study aims at filling the gap by investigating the subjective categorization of road alignments based on middle-aged driver groups. A total of sixteen participants with ages ranging from 23 to 40 years were recruited. Participants were first asked to undertake naturalistic driving tests on a four-lane divided mountainous freeway while photos of the road and the driving speed were collected. Participants were then asked to subjectively sort the photos of the road into piles, within each pile we considered their driving behaviors would be similar. Finally, questionnaire survey was conducted in terms of comfort, safety, speed choice and sight distance. The picture grouping revealed three distinct and non-overlapping subjective categories of road alignment. And driver’s ratings about comfort and safety were significantly different between these categories. The category with the largest sight distance and highest speed choice turned out to have the lowest rating in comfort and safety (note that the rating scales for comfort and safety had reversed polarity such that low numbers indicated high comfort and high safety). Statistical evidences indicated that the drivers have developed underlying mental schema about road alignment. Therefore, their speed choices on combined alignment were further investigated. The difference between actual driving speed and driver’s expected speed showed close relation to the ratings and significant difference between two of the categories. Road with large absolute value in speed difference informed inconsistency between geometric design and driver’s expectation from the aspects of drivers’ perception and expectation of the road. The findings provided insight into how middle-aged driver views and categorizes road alignment. And it was found that the drivers relied on visual characteristics of the alignment to distinguish the categories instead of separate horizontal and vertical geometric parameters. It was implied that more considerations should be taken into driver’s perception of road during alignment design to improve road safety.}

abstract = {In evaluating the effectiveness of a road safety treatment, the regression to the mean phenomenon is a cause for concern because of a possible overestimation of benefits. Therefore, Bayesian approaches are usually suggested as the most appropriate methodologies for before—after studies as they account for regression to the mean effects. The empirical Bayes (EB) methodology examines the estimation of the expected number of crashes that would have occurred without treatment and compares them with the crashes observed at the treated sites. Even if there is no significant regression to the mean bias, the EB technique requires a reliable and large dataset with sufficient years of observation and number of treated sites, adequate for estimating the safety effects of a treatment with acceptable standard errors. In this framework, a full Bayesian (FB) approach can mitigate the problem of using small datasets by providing more detailed causal inferences and more flexibility in selecting crash count distributions, acknowledging that a more complex methodology must be applied. With the aim of estimating the safety improvements of new, short 2 + 1 road sections in Poland limited by the existing road network, EB and FB estimations are compared and different safety performance function (SPF) model forms are used in order to evaluate the performance of the two methodologies. Results indicated that, even if crash modification factors (CMFs) resulted in similar average values, the EB trend is to underestimate CMFs compared with the more complex methodology, while overall the FB approach provided a lower standard deviation. The differences are more pronounced between the EB and FB approaches when a simple SPF model form is used for the analysed dataset. Moreover, for this specific dataset, the difference between the FB method and the EB method using a refined regression model with more variables was negligible.}

The present research evaluated Safe Cycle, an innovative Australian school-based program that addresses hazard awareness and overconfidence in addition to more typical content (e.g. handling skills), in terms of a comprehensive range of outcomes. Students from Years 4 to 8 (n = 108) completed online surveys in class before, immediately after, and approximately 14 weeks after, the 8-week program was delivered. Significant increases in knowledge and confidence were observed, while results also suggested increases in cycling participation. The program appeared to address illusory invulnerability effectively, but there was no evidence that the program improved safety-relevant cycling behaviours or experience of crashes. The benefits of Safe Cycle might be enhanced by including elements to increase motivation to perform safety-relevant behaviours and durability of program effects.}

This part also contains an overview of some differences between females and males that may influence dynamic responses in a crash. Based on the results of the review an outline for how to better represent the adult population in regulatory tests has been suggested. The second part was to reflect on these issues from a specific critical legal perspective, that is from a Gender Legal Studies point of view, focusing on the European legal framework that governs the tests of adult occupant safety in vehicles in Europe. Since the beginning of the 1970s legal scholars have shown in several areas of law that there is a gap between superior legislation and practice, but also between gender equality as a superior legal principle and subordinate legal rules that govern safety requirements. The same pattern can be discerned in the area of Transportation Law. The results of the review of the ECE regulations shows that the average sized male represents the adult population and that the average sized female has been excluded from regulations assessing the protection of adult vehicle occupants. The fundamental values, on which the Union is founded, including the overarching goals of the Union, seem to be rendered invisible in the laws and critically impact the safety of women in everyday life. According to the gender system theory, the interests and priorities of men are continuing to shape the law. Consequently, the law neglecting the safety of women on roads has implications on the development of society. The lack of legal provisions that demand female crash test dummies representing the female part of the population, means that there is no incentive for car manufacturers, authorities or other stakeholders to develop test methods and female crash test dummies in ways that promote political objectives expressed in legal form, i.e., the legal values expressed in general provisions and principles stated in the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, such as gender equality between women and men as well as non-discrimination This study highlights the undeniable gap between the legal framework and legal requirements with regard to occupant safety for the whole adult population. It would be attainable to bridge this particular gender gap by providing equal representation for the female part of the population with regard to vehicle safety, as that males benefit from.}

Secondly, our results point to a decline in drunk driving offences alongside an increase in its punition, mainly after the implementation of the Penalty Points System for driving licenses in Spain on July 1st 2006. We estimate that drunk drivers should be fined by 1250€, in order to offset its external costs.

We addressed this gap by asking participants to discriminate the orientation of an oncoming human shape in a virtual environment while they were: i) walking on a treadmill, or ii) texting while walking on a treadmill. Participants’ performance (i.e., correctly identifying if a walker would pass them to their left or right) and electroencephalography (EEG) data was collected. Unsurprisingly, we found that participants performed better while they were only walking than when texting while walking. However, we also found that the diminished performance is differently related to task set inhibition and task set activation in the two conditions. The alpha oscillations, which can be used as an index of task inhibition, have a significantly different relation to performance in the two conditions, the relation being negative when subjects are texting. This may indicate that the more inhibition is needed, the more the performance is affected by texting. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the brain signature of task switching in texting while walking. This finding is the first step in identifying the source of impaired judgment in texting pedestrians and in finding viable solutions to reduce the risks.}

Utilised together, the technology would essentially take the form of a licence interlock. The goal of this program of research (from which this paper stems) was to provide preliminary recommendations as to which technology is the most beneficial and should be implemented as part of a government-led program increasing the functionalities of electronic driving licences (EDL). The corresponding BCR analysis revealed that fingerprints and finger vascular patterns recognition technologies were found to systematically have the best BCRs. In regard to the most effective manner to implement the technology, a corresponding investigation with five scenarios revealed that the greatest benefits would be achieved with: (a) a mandatory system for all banned drivers (e.g., suspensions \& disqualifications), and (b) a mandatory system for banned drivers under the age of 21 only. Scenario (b) performs extremely well, with returns of up to 16 times the investment with a simple fingerprint-based interlock. Although often more modest, all systems were found to have BCRs above 1 in all of the implementation scenarios except one.

As the demand for freight transportation has increased in recent years, traffic agencies are more interested in monitoring heavy vehicle-involved crash risk because of the severity of accidents and high secondary crash risks. This study processes per-vehicle data from a WIM (weight-in-motion) sensor to investigate the heavy vehicle-involved crash risk potential (CRP) on freeways. To estimate rear-end CRP, one of the previously developed models is modified to use WIM data. In addition, this study proposes a technique for estimating the crash risk level, which is determined by comparing the estimated crash risk probability with the maximum expected risk probability at a given level of service (LOS). A time-series investigation reveals that there is clear difference in the CRP and crash risk level between lanes and there are two major time windows with high heavy vehicle-involved crash risk levels. After repeating the exercise for all available data, this study confirms that these observations are systematic and reproducible. Not only can the results in this study provide a local guidance for traffic agencies to prepare for heavy vehicle crash prevention strategies, but reiterating the investigation over multiple locations also allows them to monitor heavy vehicle crash risk levels at the network level.}

The long-term objective is that no one shall be killed or seriously injured in traffic and that the design, function and use of the transport system shall be adapted to the standards this requires. In this article we try to understand the concept of RTI as a public health problem and why that understanding has led to the introduction of Vison Zero and then sporadic attempts to establish road safety as a fundamental human right.

Some of the ways forward include: (a) Every policy, law or safety standard (concerning roads, vehicles or traffic management) established by the state to be accompanied by a justification for the same by including systematic reviews of the scientific evidence used for the decision and the expected safety benefits in numerical estimates. (b) Manufacturers of vehicles and other road-based technologies to explicitly state the quality and limits of the safety features embedded in their technologies. (c) International agencies dealing with road safety (state and non-state) to examine all sources of systematic reviews of road safety interventions and use them to justify the policies they pursue. They should also make it explicit that they will fund road safety activity by non-government organisations only if they promote interventions justified by scientific evidence.}

This paper studies the effects of PPPs on road safety outcomes by taking advantage of the variety of production models provided in the Spanish highway network. Results based on a panel-data fixed-effects method show that the most relevant aspect influencing road safety outcomes is the quality of design of the road. However, we find evidence suggesting that privately operated highways (PPPs) are positively correlated with better road safety outcomes for roads with similar quality. This finding that should be confirmed by further research raises interest in the mechanisms that could produce this link between management models and road safety.}

Specifically, statistical analysis was conducted to evaluate whether the amount of inattention prompts that drivers received changed over time, possibly indicating a change in the amount of inattention that drivers exhibited. The driving performance data was collected from sixteen participants who drove a Level 2 vehicle in an experimental setting, as part of the study Human Factors Evaluation of Level 2 and Level 3 Driving Concepts. A proprietary driver inattention warning system was installed on the experiment vehicles. The system would send a warning signal if the driver’s attention was not on the primary driving task for a pre-specified duration. This study focuses on driver’s response when experiencing prompts after two seconds of inattention while operating a Level 2 vehicle in automated mode. The results show that on average, the frequency of prompts the participants received decreased over the course of the experiment from 29.9 in the first ten minutes to 18.1/10 min after 110 min. The decrease levelled off after about two hours. The fact that participants received fewer prompts over time suggests that they had fewer instances of inattention lasting at least two seconds as the experiment progressed. This suggests that drivers would adapt to the alert and adjust their behavior to avoid triggering the inattention alert. The results of this study provide evidence for a potential benefit of incorporating a prompting system in vehicles with automated functions.}

abstract = {Driver PT is critical when a driver faces an imminent crash risk and needs to determine what evasive maneuvers to execute. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to study how PT varies across different critical driving situations. PT refers to the time drivers need to recognize the nature and significance of external stimuli. Driver PT is critical when he or she faces a potentially hazardous driving situation, and must determine what action(s) or evasive maneuver(s) to execute. Although past research has identified many factors associated with PT, little research has been done on the effects of critical driving situations on PT, let alone in a real-world driving environment. Naturalistic driving study (NDS) data provides an unprecedented opportunity to look into PT prior to the occurrence of safety-related events. This study seeks to shed light on how critical driving situations influence driver PT, as well as how the driving environment and driver behavior affect PT during real-world driving by utilizing the Second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP2) NDS data. An NDS consists of two primary features that distinguish it from retrospective approaches: vehicles are equipped with video camera technologies that observe the driver and the road ahead of the vehicle continuously while driving, and drivers are asked to drive as they normally would. To best study PT while minimizing the effects of confounding factors, this study focused on a total of 1417 rear-end crashes and near crashes. It was found that critical driving situations, the driving environment, and driver behavior are all influential factors in explaining the variation of PT among different drivers. The longest PTs are during critical driving situations where the vehicle ahead is stop-and-go, which can be as long as 2.84 s while controlling for the effects of driving environment and driver behavior factors, compared to other types of driving situations such as a vehicle ahead decelerating or lane changing.}

However, little research has investigated the use of turn signals among motorists, particularly in developing countries with high levels of motorcycle use. This research aimed to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with turn signal use at intersections among car drivers and motorcyclists in Da Nang, Vietnam. Cross-sectional roadside observations were undertaken at 24 sites across Da Nang City during weekday and weekend periods. A total of 17,142 vehicles were observed, including 2392 cars and 14,750 motorcycles. Turn signal use among car drivers (68.27%) was found to be significantly higher than motorcyclists (40.13%). Binary logistic regression modelling showed that turn signal neglect at intersections was associated with making a right turn, not carrying passengers, travelling outside of the city centre, travelling on weekdays, and the absence of separate car lanes, pedestrian crossings and traffic lights. Despite national legislation regulating turn signal use in Vietnam, the use of turn signals is relatively low compared with developed countries. The findings highlight the need for both greater and more targeted enforcement of existing legislation combined with extensive road safety education.}

To address this, we examined self-reported anger-based aggression in a sample of “active” cyclists (N = 623: males = 69%) defined as those who regularly ride a bicycle on-road (all rode at least once a week, 64% rode between 4–7 days per week). Using the Cyclist Anger Expression Inventory (CAX) three broad types of anger-based aggression were identified: 1) constructive ways of dealing with anger, 2) verbal aggression and 3) personal physical aggression. Cyclists reported that most to almost all of the time they deal with anger in adaptive constructive ways. When they were aggressive, they were most likely to express this through verbal types of aggression such as shouting or swearing aloud. Personal physical types of aggression were infrequent and these were the only type of behaviour found to be related to crashes. Regression analyses showed that factors associated with personal physical aggression included anger propensities, distance travelled, being male and younger. Interestingly, personal physical aggression was also more frequently expressed by cyclists classified as “strong and fearless” (Geller, 2009), that is avid cyclists who feel comfortable in all riding environments. Therefore, although the expressions of extreme aggression are rare, they are expressed in a group of riders who regularly ride on the road, making them particularly vulnerable. Effective strategies need to be developed to lessen cyclist aggression and mitigate the potential risks associated with these behaviours, for both cyclists and other vulnerable road users.}

Although count models are widely used for arterial roads, their application to rural local roads is sparse, partly due to the concern of possible estimation bias caused by low crash counts. This paper revisits the matter to further evaluate the suitability of negative binomial models for rural local roads with low crash frequencies, comparing the performance of the model to probabilistic regression (ordered probit) proposed in the past. The negative binomial model was estimated to predict crashes for rural local intersections and compared to predictions obtained from the ordered probit model. Bivariate versions of both models were applied to improve model efficiency by incorporating correlation between two severity outcomes, fatal/injury (FI) and property damage only (PDO) crashes. The estimated models included several significant variables with intuitive signs. These results are discussed in the paper to support the claim that both models are adequate. Furthermore, the cumulative sums of the model-predicted and observed crashes conditioned on the estimated effects were compared to detect any systematic bias in the results. Although both models showed similar performance and no obvious biases could be detected, the negative binomial model seemed to behave slightly better than the ordered probit model, demonstrating the model’s suitability in the analyzed case. The results point to the possibility of applying the Highway Safety Manual methodology to lower-volume county roads with focus shifted from individual high-crash locations to safety-deficient road features present at multiple locations.}

There usually exist unobserved risk factors which could jointly affect crash rates of different types, resulting in correlation and heterogeneity issues across observations. The primary objective of the study is to propose a novel random parameters multivariate Tobit (RPMV-Tobit) model for evaluating risk factors on crash rates of different collision types. Crash data from 367 freeway diverge areas in a three-year period were obtained for modeling. Three major types of collisions including rear-end, sideswipe, and angle collisions were considered. The RPMV-Tobit model was structured to simultaneously accommodate correlations between crash rates across collision types and unobserved heterogeneity across observations. The RPMV-Tobit model was compared with a multivariate Tobit (MV-Tobit) model, a random effect multivariate Tobit (REMV-Tobit) model, and independent univariate Tobit (IU-Tobit) models under the Bayesian framework. The results showed that MV-Tobit model outperforms the IU-Tobit models on fitting crash rates, indicating that accounting for the correlation between crash types can improve model fit. The RPMV-Tobit model and REMV-Tobit model perform better than the MV-Tobit model, suggesting that accounting for the unobserved heterogeneous can further improve model fit. The improvement of model performance with the RPMV-Tobit model is higher than that with the REMV-Tobit model. The impacts of each risk factor on crash rates were estimated and some differences were found across different collision types. The lane-balanced design, number of lanes on mainline, speed limit, and speed difference present significant heterogeneous effects on crash rates. Findings suggest that the RPMV-Tobit model is a superior approach for comprehensive crash rates modeling and traffic safety evaluation purposes.}

Investigating the relationships between these behaviors and drivers’ crash risk can provide a better understanding of the personal factors contributing to the incidence of crashes, allowing the more effective development of safety education and road management countermeasures and interventions. The objectives of this study are therefore: 1) to determine the extent to which driver involvement in both crashes and near crashes (CNCs) is related to self-reported driving behaviors, and 2) to assess the relationship between each type of risky behavior and individual driver CNC risk. Driver and crash data were acquired from the Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study and included 45 males and 12 females, participants with the mean age of 38.7. A K-mean cluster method was adopted to classify participants into three CNC groups of high-, moderate- and low-risk drivers. Drivers completed the DBQ to self-evaluate the frequency during their daily driving of the questionnaire’s 24 risky behaviors. Principal component analysis of the 24 items led to a five-component structure including aggressive violations, ordinary violations, lapses, inattention errors, and inexperience errors. Two logistic regression models were developed to investigate the correlation between the five DBQ components and drivers’ CNC levels. Conclusions are as follows: 1) high-risk drivers were significantly more likely to have engaged in inattention errors (e.g., missing a “yield” sign) and ordinary violations (e.g., running a red light) than the other drivers, and, 2) aggressive violations (e.g., racing against others) and ordinary violations were positively related to the probability of being a high- or moderate-risk driver.}

This study aims to quantify the effectiveness of the CV-VSL application by exploring drivers’ reactions to warnings (e.g., recommended travel speeds). In order to analyze the effectiveness of the CV-VSL application, a connected vehicle testing platform was established based on a driving simulator, and characteristics of the drivers’ speed adjustments after receiving warnings were analyzed with respect to different levels of visibility (i.e., no fog, slight fog, and heavy fog). This study also examined the effect of warnings on drivers in different impact zones (i.e., clear zone, transition zone, and fog zone). Three indicators were identified: 1) speed at the end of the clear zone, 2) maximum deceleration rate in the transition zone, and 3) average speed reduction in the fog zone. Throughout the experiment, the relationship between speed adjustments and the level of visibility was explored. The results indicated that the CV-VSL application is effective in making drivers reduce travel speeds in all three types of zones. Furthermore, it appeared that the CV-VSL application could help manage travel speeds prior to vehicles entering the transition zone, and influence drivers’ braking decisions upon encountering reduced visibility. It was also found that the CV-VSL application was more effective in heavy fog conditions than in light fog conditions. The connected vehicle testing platform based on the driving simulator provided a new method for evaluating the effectiveness of in-vehicle messaging generated by connected vehicle applications.}

Although auto manufacturers and innovators have attempted to confirm that AVs are safe and have introduced them on public roads, it is vital to understand end-users’ acceptance of AVs. A total of 1453 participants voluntarily and validly completed a series of questionnaires. The questionnaires included the Autonomous Vehicle Acceptability Scale (AVAS), the Traffic Climate Scale (TCS), and sociodemographic variables. The satisfactory internal consistency reliability and construct validity revealed that the newly developed Chinese version of the AVAS is a suitable tool to measure public acceptance of AVs. Moreover, exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis conformed to the four factors of AVAS, including benefits in usefulness (BIU), benefits in situations (BIS), concern scenarios (CS) and system concern (SC). Scores higher on benefits and lower on concerns represent more acceptance of AVs. In addition, we found that the public’s perceived local traffic safety climate affected the attitude toward AVs. More specifically, external affective demands (EAD) were found to be a significant predictor of SC, internal requirements (IR) were shown to have an effect on BIS and CS, and functionality was found to be a significant predictor of BIU and SC. Furthermore, the differences between drivers and non-drivers revealed that drivers were concerned significantly less about AVs and regarded AVs as more useful than non-drivers did. To gain more customers for the purchase of AVs, it is necessary for automotive vehicle manufacturers and retailers to introduce and advertise the functions and usability of autonomous driving systems to the public. Gaining acceptance from end users and understanding the factors that affect acceptability will be critical to the widespread deployment of AVs.}

However, it is crucial to understand how drivers deal with dynamically adapting technologies particularly in situations in which driver state monitoring fails and the system shows unexpected behavior. To better understand the consequences of unreliable adaptive ADAS on safety and to assess how failures of an adaptive FCW influence driving behavior, we conducted a driving simulator study with N = 48 participants. Participants experienced critical brake events in situations with and without a distracting secondary task. An adaptive FCW provided visual warnings to undistracted drivers but highly supportive visuo-haptic warnings (brake jerks or vibration) to distracted drivers. In 20% of brake events, however, the system unexpectedly provided incorrectly adapted warnings in which the combination of warning type and distraction was reversed. This adaptive FCW was compared to a non-adaptive standard FCW that provided visual warnings only. We found that incorrect warnings impaired driver reactions and safety in distracted drivers, and these adverse behavioral effects had two sources: (1) Violations of the drivers´ expectancies about the warning, and hence, behavioral adaptation. (2) The absence of the compensatory effect of the highly supportive warning in case of distraction. In contrast, correctly adapted warnings reduced decrements in brake reaction times and fully offset safety deficits associated with driver distraction. Crucially, however, an effectiveness evaluation of the adaptive system’s potential to support drivers when correct warnings were elicited failed to demonstrate a benefit of the adaptive FCW over the non-adaptive FCW. Our results thus emphasize that a high reliability is crucial for adaptive ADAS to improve safety and to prevent adverse effects due to behavioral adaptation.}

Issues of concern are the lightness with which decisions affecting road-user safety can be based on opinion that is unsupported by evidence, that such opinions can trump inconvenient evidence, that research findings can be willfully distorted or disregarded, that questionable results can be given a ring of consensual truth, and that the questions which research asks and what findings get published are at times influenced by external interest. In sum, the concern is that practice is not sufficiently evidence-based. Road users have a right to expect that decisions substantially affecting their safety take into account fact-based expectation of safety consequences. It is therefore time to endow the research-practice relationship with a premeditated and purposeful structure.}

Our study differs from others in that it discusses the identification of probable hot zones and enhances the capability to examine a given highway by determining “dangerous probable lengths”, which aims to anticipate the traffic crashes in the future. The identified hot zones and probable hot zones exhibit different regional and temporal characteristics. There are clearly some outstanding spatial clusters of crashes covering specific locations. In both Northwest and Center-West regions, the majority of the identified hot zones and probable hot zones predominantly occur along mainly highways characterized by a dominant rural character. In the Center-East region, both hot zones and probable hot zones are mostly spread northeast and south-west more precisely in NH1 and NH2 where many urban activities are taking place. Spatial autocorrelation indices per region address the diversity within the regions and provide us with useful insights that can be translated into safety policies in Tunisia.}

In addition, trajectory-level vehicle controls are receiving substantial attention as sensors, wireless communications, and control systems are rapidly advancing. This study proposes a novel vehicle speed control strategy to minimize inter-vehicle crash risks in automated driving environments. The proposed methodology consists of the following three components: a risk estimation module, a risk map construction module, and a vehicle speed control module. The essence of the proposed strategy is to adjust the subject vehicle speed based on an analysis of the interactions among a subject vehicle and the surrounding vehicles. Crash risks are quantified by a fault tree analysis (FTA) method to integrate the crash occurrence potential and crash severity at every time step. A crash risk map is then constructed by projecting the integrated risk of the subject vehicle into a two-dimensional space composed of relative speed and relative spacing data. Next, the vehicle speed is continuously controlled to reach the target speed using risk map analysis to prevent a crash. The performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated by a VISSIM simulator with various traffic congestion levels and market penetration rates (MPR) of controlled vehicles. For example, an approximate 50% reduction rate of the crash potential was achievable without a loss of the operational performance of the traffic stream when all vehicles were controlled by the proposed methodology under the level of service (LOS) C conditions. This study is meaningful in that vehicle speed control is performed for the purpose of speed harmonization in a traffic stream based on a comprehensive analysis of inter-vehicle risks. It is expected that the outcome of this study will be valuable for supporting the development of vehicle control systems for preventing crashes in automated driving environments.}

A comparison study was conducted for four scenarios in heavy fog condition. First, a series of indexes corresponding to driving speed adjustments and surrogate measures of safety was obtained to explore the impacts that fog warning systems have on driving behavior and traffic safety when approaching a fog area. This study divided the analyzed road into three different zones (clear zone, transition zone, and fog zone) according to visibility levels. Then, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted, and the effects of drivers’ individual characteristics on driving behavior were also investigated. Moreover, the linear mixed model with random effects was estimated to consider the contributing factors of the drivers’ speed adjustment behaviors. In addition, the standard deviation of speed, TET (time exposed time-to-collision), and TIT (time integrated time-to-collision) were selected to evaluate the longitudinal safety. To obtain the driving data, an empirical driving simulator platform was established based on a real-world road in Beijing. Thirty-five drivers were recruited to participate in the driving experiment. The results showed that the cooperative vehicle-infrastructure warning systems could be beneficial to better driving behavior and safer traffic operations. The results revealed that the warning systems could be beneficial to speed reduction before entering a fog area. In addition, the On-Board Unit (OBU) had a significant impact on individual speed adjustment. Moreover, the results showed that scenarios with fog warning systems improve safety significantly over the no warning system scenario. The study results could also facilitate the selection of a proper information release format in the context of connected vehicles.}

In the U.S., a safety rating is assigned to each motor carrier based on data obtained from the Motor Carrier Management Information System (MCMIS) and an on-site investigation. While researchers have identified variables associated with the safety ratings, the specific direction of the relationships are not necessarily clear.
Objective
The objective of this study is to identify those relationships involved in the safety ratings of interstate motor carriers, the largest users of the U.S. transportation network.
Method
Bayesian networks are used to learn these relationships from data obtained from MCMIS for a 6-year period (2007–2012).
Results
Our study shows that safety rating assignment is a complex process with only a subset of the variables having statistically significant relationship with safety rating. They include driver out-of-service violations, weight violations, traffic violations, fleet size, total employed drivers, and passenger \& general carrier indicators.
Application
The findings have both immediate implications and long term benefits. The immediate implications relate to better identification of unsafe motor carriers, and the long term benefits pertain to policies and crash countermeasures that can enhance carrier safety.}

abstract = {In the United States, there are approximately 212,000 highway-rail grade crossings, some of which experience vehicle-train incidents that often cause a massive financial burden, loss of life, and injury. In 2017, there were 2,108 highway-rail incidents resulting in 827 injuries and 307 fatalities nationwide. To eliminate collision risks, crossing grade separation and active alarm improvement are commonly used. Moreover, crossing closures are considered to be the most effective safety improvement program. While it may be very difficult, and in some cases impossible to close crossings, there are some incentive programs that facilitate the closure process. One of these programs is a working consolidation model that aims to determine crossing closure suitability. Using details of highway-rail grade crossings in the United States and applying an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGboost) algorithm, this paper proposes a data-driven consolidation model that takes into consideration a number of engineering variables. The results indicated an overall accuracy of 0.991 for the proposed model. In addition, the developed XGboost consolidation model reported the relative importance of the variables input to the model, offering an in-depth understanding of the model’s behavior. Finally, for the practical implementation of the model, a simplified version containing fewer variables was developed. A sensitivity analysis was performed considering the aggregate gain and the different correlation threshold values between variables. This analysis developed a simplified model utilizing 14 variables, with aggregated gain values of 75% and a correlation threshold of 0.9 which would perform similarly to the full model. Based on this model, 62% of current highway-rail grade crossings should be closed.}

A literature search was carried out on RLC studies in the period 2013–2017 which, after screening, identified 18 recent studies on red light cameras (RLCs) and speed/red light cameras (SRLCs). The methodology and results of these studies were further examined and summary safety estimates were derived and compared to earlier meta-analysis summary estimates. The primary conclusion is that the new safety estimates from this paper show a 12% decrease of total crashes and confirm the general tendency of RLCs to reduce right angle crashes while at the same time increasing rear-end crashes. However, comparing the developments over time, the review reveals that safety estimates tend to increase with time (the safety effects of the most recent studies are the greatest). Also safety estimates suggest more positive effects with SRLCs than with RLCs. Most of recent studies indicate that spillover effects are present and can be quite substantial.}

Understanding the essence of the pedestrian crash is important to the development of effective safety countermeasures and improvement of social well-being. It is necessary to measure the exposure for the quantification of pedestrian crash risk. The primary goals of this study are to explore the efficient exposure measure for pedestrian crash, and identify the possible factors contributing to the incidence of pedestrian crash. In this study, amount of travel was estimated based on the Travel Characteristic Survey (TCS) data in 2011, and the crash data were obtained from the Transport Information System (TIS) of the Hong Kong Transport Department during the period from 2011 to 2015. Total population, walking frequency and walking time were adopted to represent the pedestrian exposure to road crash. The effect of trip purpose on pedestrian crash was evaluated by disaggregating the pedestrian exposure proxies by purpose. Three random-parameter negative binomial regression models were developed to compare the performances of the three pedestrian exposure proxies. It was found that the model in which walking frequency was used as the exposure proxy provided the best goodness-of-fit. Frequency of walking back home, among other trip purposes, was the most sensitive to the increase in pedestrian crash risk. Additionally, increase in the frequency of pedestrian crash was correlated to the increases in the proportions of children and elderly people. Furthermore, household size, median household income, road density, number of non-signalized intersection as well as number of zebra crossings also significantly affected the pedestrian crash frequency. Findings of this study should be indicative to the development and implementation of effective traffic control and management measures that can improve the pedestrian safety in the long run.}

One method to potentially reduce such crashes is to provide additional driver information in the form of wider longitudinal edgeline pavement markings. However, since these markings deteriorate over time, the primary objective of this research was to study the effects of longitudinal edgeline pavement markings with varying deterioration levels and widths and to assess a driver’s ability to maintain lane position. The University of Idaho’s driving simulator was used to examine these effects by incorporating different marking deterioration percentages and roadway geometries on a two-lane rural highway environment. Two different pavement marking widths (4 and 6 inch) and four different deterioration levels (0%, 25%, 50%, and 75%) were assessed in daytime and nighttime conditions as part of this study. The results determined that while wider 6-in longitudinal edgeline pavement markings compared with standard four inch edgeline markings did not cause any significant changes in driver lane deviation during the day, statistically significant differences were observed in nighttime driving conditions. Drivers consistently maintained a lane position that slightly favored the edgeline side throughout the study and increasingly shifted away from the centerline as edgeline deterioration worsened.}

Recent work found available motorcycle PPE to be thermally inefficient in hot weather with potential to cause significant thermal strain under average Australian summer conditions. The current study investigated the potential for the cognitive and psychophysical concomitants of thermal strain to compromise reaction times, mood and fatigue with potential consequences for motorcyclists’ safety.
Method
Volunteers wearing motorcycle PPE participated in a 90 min trial (cycling 30 W) in 35 °C, 40%RH with overhead radiant heaters and a fan to simulate wind speed. Heart rate, core and skin temperature were recorded continuously. Reaction time and subjective ratings of thermal sensation and comfort, workload and mood were recorded at baseline, during rest breaks at 25 min intervals and on completion of the trail. Repeated measures analysis assessed each participant’s performance against their own baseline.
Results
Core temperatures increased by 2 °C (p < .0001), skin temperatures (3 °C, (p < .0001) and heart rates (66bpm, p < .0001). Reaction times fluctuated 36 ms 8% (p < .0001) over the trial. Subjective workload increased 68% (p = 0.001) and mood deteriorated 33 points (p < .0001) including feeling less alert (p = <.0001), contented (p = 0.001) and calm (p = 0.0004). Multivariate repeated measures analysis found significant associations between core temperature and workload (p = 0.01), mood (p = 0.001) and reaction time (<.0001). Skin temperature and workload (p = 0.02), mood (p = 0.01) and reaction time (<.0001). Subjective ratings of temperature sensation and wetness discomfort were associated respectively with increased workload (p = 0.0001, p = 0.004), mood change (p < .0001, p = 0.04) and reaction time (p < .0001, p < .0001).
Conclusions
The physiological impact of wearing thermally inefficient motorcycle PPE in hot conditions could impair motorcyclists cognitive and psychophysical functioning and, potentially, their riding performance and safety. These outcomes indicate an urgent need for manufacturers to develop motorcycle PPE that is effective and suitable for use, in hot conditions.}

The participants carried out three tasks: (i) a simple walking task, (ii) a dual task involving walking while scanning (walking while pressing a button as soon as a visual or sound stimulus appeared), and (iii) a street-crossing task with vehicles approaching from two directions. The results indicated more street-crossing collisions in older-old than in younger-old and young participants. Longer reaction times were observed in the dual walking-scanning task for both old groups, especially for visual stimuli. Walking-speed comparisons yielded nonsignificant differences between the dual task and the street-crossing task in young participants, suggesting a correspondence in terms of demands and task priority. In contrast, old participants walked significantly faster in the street-crossing task than in the dual task, suggesting that they placed priority on walking rapidly than on scanning traffic. Finally, whereas the participants estimated the perceived workload to be greater when they were crossing the street than while simply walking or responding to the dual task, young participants gave the highest rating to the mental and physical demands, perhaps due to a lack of awareness of task demands among old participants.}

This study aimed to quantify passing distance and assess the impact of motor vehicle and road infrastructure characteristics on passing distance. Methods: An on-road observational study was conducted in Victoria, Australia. Participants had a custom device installed on their bicycle and rode as per their usual cycling for one to two weeks. A hierarchical linear model was used to investigate the relationship between motor vehicle and infrastructure characteristics (location, presence of on-road marked bicycle lane and the presence of parked cars on the kerbside) and passing distance (defined as the lateral distance between the end of the bicycle handlebars and the passing motor vehicle). Results: Sixty cyclists recorded 18,527 passing events over 422 trips. The median passing distance was 173 cm (Q1: 137 cm, Q3: 224 cm) and 1085 (5.9%) passing events were less than 100 cm. Relative to sedans, 4WDs had a reduced mean passing distance of 15 cm (Q1: 12 cm, Q3: 17 cm) and buses had a reduced mean passing distance of 28 cm (Q1: 16 cm, Q3: 40 cm). Relative to passing events that occurred on roads without a marked bicycle lane and without parked cars, passing events on roads with a bike lane with no parked cars had a reduced mean passing distance of 27 cm (Q1: 25 cm, Q3: 29 cm), and passing events on roads with a bike lane and parked cars had a mean lower passing distance of 40 cm (Q1: 37 cm, Q3: 43 cm). Conclusions: One in every 17 passing events was a close (<100 cm) passing event. We identified that on-road bicycle lanes and parked cars reduced passing distance. These data can be used to inform the selection and design of cycling-related infrastructure and road use with the aim of improving safety for cyclists.}

abstract = {Indicating road safety-related aspects in the phase of planning and operating is always a challenging task for experts. The success of any method applied in identifying a high-risk location or black spot (BS) on the road should depend fundamentally on how data is organized into specific homogeneous segments. The appropriate combination of black spot identification (BSID) method and segmentation method contributes significantly to the reduction in false positive (a site involved in safety investigation while it is not needed) and false negative (not involving a site in safety investigation while it is needed) cases in identifying BS segments. The purpose of this research is to study and compare the effect of methodological diversity of road network segmentation on the performance of different BSID methods. To do this, four commonly applied BS methods (empirical Bayesian (EB), excess EB, accident frequency, and accident ratio) have been evaluated against four different segmentation methods (spatial clustering, constant length, constant traffic volume, and the standard Highway Safety Manual segmentation method). Two evaluations have been used to compare the performance of the methods. The approach first evaluates the segmentation methods based on the accuracy of the developed safety performance function (SPF). The second evaluation applies consistency tests to compare the joint performances of the BS methods and segmentation methods. In conclusion, BSID methods showed a significant change in their performance depending on the different segmentation method applied. In general, the EB method has surpassed the other BSID methods in case of all segmentation approaches.}

In the field of transportation safety, an absolute conflict occurs when two parties’ paths cross and one of the parties must undertake an evasive maneuver (e.g. change direction or stop) to avoid a crash. Other less severe conflicts where paths cross but no evasive maneuver is required may also impact public perceptions of safety especially for vulnerable modes. Most of the existing literature focuses on vehicle conflicts. While in the past several years, more research has investigated bicycle and pedestrian conflicts, most of this has focused on the intersection environment. A comprehensive analysis of conflicts appears critical. The major objective of this study is two fold: 1) Development of an innovative and cost effective conflict data collection technique to better understand the conflicts (and their severity) involving vulnerable road users (e.g. bicycle/pedestrian, bicycle/motor vehicle, and pedestrian/motor vehicle) and their severity. 2) Test the effectiveness and practicality of the approach taken and its associated crowd sourced data collection. In an endeavor to undertake these objectives, the researchers developed an android-based crowd-sourced data collection app. The crowd-source data collected using the app is compared with traditional fatality data for hot spot analysis. At the end, the app users provide feedback about the overall competency of the app interface and the performance of its features to the app developers. If widely adopted, the app will enable communities to create their own data collection efforts to identify dangerous sites within their neighborhoods. Agencies will have a valuable data source at low-cost to help inform their decision making related to bicycle and pedestrian education, encouragement, enforcement, programs, policies, and infrastructure design and planning.}

In this paper we further developed this approach by assessing the potential of controlling vehicle braking to reduce pedestrian ground contact injuries. Applying a recently proposed Simulation Test Sample, a series of simulations were run using the MADYMO software environment. The approach considered 6 vehicle shapes, 4 pedestrian models, 3 impact velocities and 2 pedestrian gaits and each case was considered with two different vehicle braking approaches. The first was full braking, while the second applied controlled braking, for which a strategy based on pedestrian kinematics was applied. The effect of vehicle braking was evaluated using the Weighted Injury Cost (WIC) of overall pedestrian injuries and the pedestrian-ground impact velocity change. The proximity of the vehicle and pedestrian at the instant of ground contact was also evaluated to assess the potential of future vehicle based intervention methods to cushion the ground contact. Finally real-world videos of pedestrian collisions were analyzed to estimate the available free vehicle stopping distances. Results showed substantial median reductions in WIC and head impact velocity for all vehicle shapes except the Van. The proximity of the pedestrian to the vehicle front at the instant of ground contact under controlled braking is less than 1.5 m in most cases, and the required stopping distance for the vehicle under controlled braking was within the available stopping distance estimated from the video footage in about 74% of cases. It is concluded that controlled braking has significant potential to reduce the overall burden of pedestrian ground contact injuries, but future efforts are required to establish an optimized braking strategy as well as a means to handle those cases where controlled braking is not beneficial or even harmful.}

abstract = {Background
Pedestrians struck in motorised vehicle crashes constitute the largest group of traffic fatalities worldwide. Excessive speed is the primary contributory factor in such crashes. The relationship between estimated impact speed and the risk of a pedestrian fatality has generated much debate concerning what should be a safe maximum speed limit for vehicles in high pedestrian active areas.
Methods
Four electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, COMPENDEX, and SCOPUS) were searched to identify relevant studies. Records were assessed, and data retrieved independently by two authors in adherence with the PRISMA statement. The included studies reported data on pedestrian fatalities from motorised vehicle crashes with known estimated impact speed. Summary odds ratios (OR) were obtained using meta-regression models. Time trends and publication bias were assessed.
Results
Fifty-five studies were identified for a full-text assessment, 27 met inclusion criteria, and 20 were included in a meta-analysis. The analyses found that when the estimated impact speed increases by 1 km/h, the odds of a pedestrian fatality increases on average by 11% (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.10–1.12). The risk of a fatality reaches 5% at an estimated impact speed of 30 km/h, 10% at 37 km/h, 50% at 59 km/h, 75% at 69 km/h and 90% at 80 km/h. Evidence of publication bias and time trend bias among included studies were found.
Conclusions
The results of the meta-analysis support setting speed limits of 30–40 km/h for high pedestrian active areas. These speed limits are commonly used by best practice countries that have the lowest road fatality rates and that practice a Safe System Approach to road safety.}

abstract = {The frequency and severity of traffic crashes have commonly been used as indicators of crash risk on transport networks. Comprehensive modeling of crash risk should account for both frequency and injury severity—capturing both the extent and intensity of transport risk for designing effective safety improvement programs. Previous research has revealed that crashes are correlated across severity categories because of the combined influence of risk factors, observed or unobserved. Moreover, crashes are the outcomes of a multitude of factors related to roadway design, traffic operations, pavement conditions, driver behavior, human factors, and environmental characteristics, or in more general terms: factors reflect both engineering and non-engineering risk sources. Perhaps not surprisingly, engineering risk sources have dominated the list of variables in the mainstream modeling of crashes whereas non-engineering sources, in particular, behavioral factors, are crucially omitted. It is plausible to assume that crash contributing factors from the same risk source affect crashes in a similar manner, but their influences vary across different risk sources. Conventional crash frequency modeling hypothesizes that the total crash count at any roadway site is well-approximated by a single risk source to which several explanatory variables contribute collaboratively. The conventional formulation is not capable of accounting for variations between risk sources; therefore, is unable to discriminate distinct impacts between engineering variables and non-engineering variables. To address this shortcoming, this study contributes to the development of multivariate multiple risk source regression, a robust modeling technique to model crash frequency and severity simultaneously. The multivariate multiple risk source regression method applied in this study can effectively capture the correlation between severity levels of crash counts while identifyinging the varying effects of crash contributing factors originated from distinct sources. Using crashes on Wisconsin rural two-lane highways, two risk sources – engineering and behavioral – were employed to develop proposed models. The modeling results were compared with a single equation negative binomial (NB) model, and a univariate multiple risk source model. The results show that the multivariate multiple risk source model significantly outperforms the other models in terms of statistical fit across several measures. The study demonstrates a unique approach to explicitly incorporating behavioral factors into crash prediction models while taking crash severity into consideration. More importantly, the parameter estimates provide more insight into the distinct sources of crash risk, which can be used to further inform safety practitioners and guide roadway improvement programs.}

In this paper, we conduct a simulation study to compare the performance of empirical Bayes (EB) and propensity score (PS) based methods, which have featured prominently in the recent literature, in settings with and without violation of key assumptions. The estimators considered include EB, inverse probability weighting (IPW), and Doubly Robust (DR) estimation. We find that while the EB approach has good finite sample properties when model assumptions are met, the consistency of this estimator is substantially diminished when the reference and treated sites follow different functions. The IPW estimator performs well in large samples, but requires a correctly specified PS model with sufficient overlap in covariate distributions between treated and control units. The DR estimator allows for violation of assumptions in either the regression or PS model, but not both. We find that this added level of robustness affords overall better performance than attained via EB or IPW estimation.}

abstract = {In the Netherlands, cyclists have to share the bicycle path with light moped riders. These riders are allowed to ride 25 km/h and do not have to wear a helmet (Dutch regulation). Due to several trends such as traffic congestion and the introduction of the scooter model, light mopeds have become more popular, both among older and younger people. This has led to an increased traffic density on bicycle paths as well as concerns about the safety of cyclists. In response to these concerns, several Dutch cities would like to ban light moped riders (LMRs) from the bicycle path and let them ride on the carriageway. However, it is uncertain what the consequences would be for the safety of light moped riders. Moreover, it is not clear to what extent the shared use of bicycle paths leads to serious crashes between cyclists and LMRs. Therefore, an in-depth crash investigation study was carried out to gain more insight into the factors and circumstances that influence the occurrence and consequences of light moped crashes on bicycle paths. A dedicated team for in-depth road crash investigation collected and analyzed detailed information on 36 light moped crashes that occurred on an urban bicycle path. This resulted in a description of the course of events for every crash that was analyzed, including a list of factors that contributed to the occurrence of the crash and possible injuries. Crashes with a similar course of events and a comparable combination of contributory factors were grouped into (sub)types of light moped crashes. Six types of crashes were identified. Based on the contributory crash factors of the identified crash types, remedial measures can be developed to prevent similar crashes from occurring in the future. Moving the LMR to the carriageway is only advisable on 30 km/h roads. Alternative measures to improve the safety of both cyclists and light moped riders include: 1) removing obstacles such as poles from the bicycle path, 2) following guidelines on the minimum width of bicycle paths given traffic volumes, 3) improving sight distances at intersections, 4) traffic light control without conflicts between traffic flows, and 5) introducing a helmet law for light moped riders and their passengers.}

However, detailed analysis of pedestrian head injuries in real world collisions is scarce. Thus the current study used two samples of 120 cases and 184 cases extracted from 1060 pedestrian collision cases captured during 2000–2015 from the GIDAS (German In-Depth-Accident Study) database to investigate the detailed characteristics of AIS2+ pedestrian head injuries. Firstly, the interrelationship between different head injury types (skull fracture, focal brain injury, concussion and diffuse axonal injury (DAI)) was analysed using the sample of 120 cases which each had at least one AIS2+ head injury. Then the influences of impact speed, pedestrian age and car front shape parameters on the injury risk of skull fracture, focal brain injury and concussion were assessed using the logistic regression method, based on the sample of 184 AIS1+ cases where the primary head contact location was within the windscreen glass area. The results show that: skull fractures and focal brain injuries dominate for AIS3+ head injuries and are generally associated with each other; concussion is the most important injury type for AIS2 head injuries and usually occurs in isolation. Further, for head impacts to the windscreen glass area a higher bonnet leading edge helps to reduce concussion odds, and none of the selected car front shape parameters are significant for the odds of skull fracture and focal brain injury, and vehicle impact speed and pedestrian age are insignificant for concussion. These detailed characteristics of pedestrian head injuries provide a basis for future pedestrian head injury prevention strategies with skull fractures and focal brain injuries being the most important injuries to address.}

Safety assessment is crucial for the development of continuous improvement strategies. However, most studies assess construction safety with cross-sectional information and thus management tends to be passive. This study proposes an evidence-based methodology incorporating hazard rectification efficiency for project safety assessment.
Method
First, we theoretically introduced hazard rectification efficiency as a proxy for hazard exposure. Later, based on set-pair analysis, we proposed a safety assessment model that incorporates hazard occurrence and rectification efficiency. Subsequently, we collected site investigation records from seven building projects in Qingdao, Shandong. The data were used to develop a safety performance index (SPI) with the proposed model and a default model. The results were compared and discussed according to industrial practices for validation purposes.
Results
The proposed model provides conservative indications of project safety performance; more importantly, the index calculated with the model provides advance warning when necessary. In the proposed method, in terms of the SPI, hazard and rectification indicators provide actionable information to address failures and improve safety conditions.
Implications
This research describes a new perspective (rectification efficiency) for safety assessment, which supplements the current body of knowledge on safety assessment. The proposed index, SPI, promotes the adoption of proactive hazard identification, monitoring, and control in construction.}

abstract = {The Highway Safety Manual (HSM) procedures apply specific safety performance functions (SPFs) and crash modification factors (CMFs) appropriate for estimating the safety effects of design and operational changes to a roadway. Although the applicability of the SPFs and CMFs may significantly vary by crash severity, they are mainly based on total crash counts, with different approaches for estimation of crashes by crash severity. The variety of approaches in the HSM and in the literature in general suggests that there may be no one best approach for all situations, and that there is a need to develop and compare alternative approaches for each potential application. This paper addresses this need by demonstrating the development and comparison of alternative approaches using horizontal curves on two-lane roads as a case study. This site type was chosen because of the high propensity for severe crashes and the potential for exploring a wide range of variables that affect this propensity. To facilitate this investigation, a two-stage modeling approach is developed whereby the proportion of crashes for each severity level is estimated as a function of roadway-specific factors and traffic attributes and then applied to an estimate of total crashes from an SPF. Using Highway Safety Information System (HSIS) curve data for Washington state, a heterogeneous negative binomial (HTNB) regression model is estimated for total crash counts and then applied with severity distribution functions (SDFs) developed by a generalized ordered probit model (GOP). To evaluate the performance of this two-stage approach, a comparison is made with predictions directly obtained from estimated univariate SPFs for crash frequency by severity and also from a fixed proportion method that has been suggested in the HSM. The results revealed that, while the two-stage SDF approach and univariate approach adopt different procedures for model estimation, their prediction accuracies are similar, and both are superior to the fixed proportion method. In short, this study highlights the potential of the two-stage SDF approach in accounting for crash frequency variations by severity levels, at least for curved two-lane road sections, and especially for the all too frequent cases where samples are too small to estimate viable univariate crash severity models.}

Prevention research has focused mainly on collisions fatal to the drivers of large trucks. This analytical observational study addresses gaps in the literature by: conducting a descriptive analysis of motor vehicle claim events involving light-vehicle drivers in a large health care industry fleet; identifying risk factors for work-related MVCs and injuries based on vehicle miles traveled; and providing details on circumstances of these events. The study examined 8068 motor vehicle events resulting in vehicle damage, property damage, or injury reported by 6680 U.S.-based drivers in a light-vehicle sales and service fleet operated by a health care company over a 4 ½-year period (January 2010 through June 2014). Thirty-three percent (n = 2660) of the events were collisions. Collisions were segmented as recoverable or non-recoverable according to whether the company could recover costs from another party, and mileage-based collision and injury rates were calculated by gender, age, tenure, and vehicle type. Differences in collision and injury rates between groups of interest (for example, tenure and age categories) were assessed with Poisson regression techniques adjusted using generalized estimating equations (GEE) for repeated observations on the same employee over time. Age, gender, and job tenure were significant collision risk factors, and risk patterns for recoverable and non-recoverable collisions were similar to those for total collisions. Collisions per million miles (CPMM) were significantly higher for drivers 21–24.9 years of age compared to drivers age 25–54.9 years (9.58 CPMM vs 4.96 CPMM, p = .025), drivers employed for less than 2 years compared to those employed 2 or more years (6.22 CPMM vs 4.82 CPMM, p < .001), for female drivers compared to male drivers (6.37 CPMM vs 4.16 CPMM, p < .001), and for drivers of passenger cars compared to all other vehicles (5.27 CPMM vs 4.48 CPMM, p < .001). Among collisions between the employee’s vehicle and another vehicle in transport, those where the front of one vehicle hit another vehicle at an angle were the most likely to result in injury to the employee driver or another party (26%), followed by rear-end collisions (25%). Special attention should be given to preventing collisions among newly-hired employees, and to preventing angle and rear-end collisions, which were the most common types of collisions and also were most likely to result in injury than all other collisions combined.}

Buckling young children in age- and size-appropriate car seats, booster seats, or seat belts and also seating them in appropriate position can lead to a significant reduction of serious and fatal injuries. This study investigated sitting behaviour and restraint use among child passengers through cross-sectional observational surveys conducted in Kumasi, Ghana. A bivariate probit model was developed for simultaneous determination of the contributing factors influencing child passenger’s sitting behaviour and restraint use. The results showed that 26% of the child passengers observed were occupying the front seat and the prevalence rate of restraint use was 4.5%. The developed bivariate probit model clearly highlights the existence of interrelationship between child passenger’s sitting position and restraint use. The key factors simultaneously influencing child passenger’s sitting position and restraint use include vehicle type, driver’s gender, driver’s belt use, child’s age, and the presence of other child or adult passenger. Furthermore, time of day and day of week also influence child passenger sitting behaviour but not their restraint use. These findings provide insight for better understanding of child transporting practices and the contributing factors influencing their sitting behaviour and restraint use. The findings also highlight the need for policy makers to design effective countermeasures to promote rear sitting and restraint use among child passengers.}

Lane-keeping ability is a lateral driver behavior that can be very crucial in run-off-road crashes under reduced visibility conditions. A number of data mining techniques have been adopted in previous studies to examine driver behavior including lane-keeping ability. This study adopted an association rules mining method, a promising data mining technique, to investigate driver lane-keeping ability in foggy weather conditions using big trajectory-level SHRP2 Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) datasets. A total of 124 trips in fog with their corresponding 248 trips in clear weather (i.e., 2 clear trips: 1 foggy weather trip) were considered for the study. The results indicated that affected visibility was associated with poor lane-keeping performance in several rules. Furthermore, additional factors including male drivers, a higher number of lanes, the presence of horizontal curves, etc. were found to be significant factors for having a higher proportion of poor lane-keeping performance. Moreover, drivers with more miles driven last year were found to have better lane-keeping performance. The findings of this study could help transportation practitioners to select effective countermeasures for mitigating run-off-road crashes under limited visibility conditions.}

The present study addressed this issue by examining the dimensionality of SCBs, as they relate to behaviors of helping, stewardship, civic virtue, whistleblowing, voice, and initiating change in current practices. Data on SCBs were collected from four industrial plants (N = 1065) in four European countries (Italy, Russia, Switzerland, United Kingdom). The results show that SCBs structure around two superordinate second-order factors that reflect affiliation and challenge. Multi-group analyses supported the structure and metric invariance of the two-factor model across the four national subsamples.}

The framework integrates learning-based feature selection, unsupervised risk rating, and imbalanced data resampling. For each vehicle, about 1300 driving behaviour features are extracted from trajectory data, which produce in-depth and multi-view measures on behaviours. To estimate the risk potentials of vehicles in driving, unsupervised data labelling is proposed. Based on extracted risk indicator features, vehicles are clustered into various groups labelled with graded risk levels. Data under-sampling of the safe group is performed to reduce the risk-safe class imbalance. Afterwards, the linkages between behaviour features and corresponding risk levels are built using XGBoost, and key features are identified according to feature importance ranking and recursive elimination. The risk levels of vehicles in driving are predicted based on key features selected. As a case study, NGSIM trajectory data are used in which four risk levels are clustered by Fuzzy C-means, 64 key behaviour features are identified, and an overall accuracy of 89% is achieved for behaviour-based risk prediction. Findings show that this approach is effective and reliable to identify important features for driving assessment, and achieve an accurate prediction of risk levels.}

This data can be used for real-time safety optimization of intersections. To achieve this, it is essential to first understand how changes in signal control affect safety in real-time. This paper develops conflict-based safety performance functions (SPFs) of signalized intersections at the cycle level using multiple traffic conflict indicators. The developed SPFs relate various dynamic traffic parameters to the number of rear-end conflicts at the signal cycle. The traffic parameters included: queue length, shock wave speed and area, and the platoon ratio. The Time-to-Collision, the Modified-Time-to-Collision, and the Deceleration Rate to Avoid the Crash were used as traffic conflict indicators. Traffic video-data collected from six signalized intersections was used in the analysis. The SPFs were developed using the Full Bayesian approach to address the unobserved heterogeneity and the variation among different sites. Overall, the results showed that all the developed SPFs have good fit with all explanatory variables being statistically significant. Also, the highest conflict frequency was noticed at the beginning of the green time, while the highest conflict severity was noticed at the beginning of the red time. Lastly, the results can be used most beneficially in real-time safety optimization of signalized intersection.}

However, the effectiveness and performance of traffic guide signs at intersections are significantly impacted by many factors, such as the types of information on traffic signs, their information volume and comprehensibility, the behavioral attributes of drivers, the geometric features of roadways, and weather and visibility conditions. When deploying traffic guide signs, efforts are needed to clarify whether the installation of a traffic guide sign is warranted. In this study, a generic approach is developed to examine and evaluate the effectiveness of traffic guide signs using simulation experiments. A traffic guide sign evaluation method (TGSEM) is developed and illustrated using examples of traffic guide sign schemes in suburban Beijing. The questionnaires showed that most drivers feel that the current traffic guide signs in suburban Beijing are insufficient and need to be rectified. Then, simulation experiments were conducted. Based on subjective experiments, the ergonomic evaluation model (DCI, the abbreviation of demand, comprehension, and information volume) was obtained. Of the four schemes, scheme 3 was shown to be the most popular. During driving simulation experiments, the analyses of average speed, standard deviation (SD) of speed, average acceleration, standard deviation of acceleration, travel time, braking frequency and throttle power showed that scheme 2 had a better impact on drivers’ behavioral data. Finally, Grey relational analysis showed that scheme 2 has the highest degree of correlation and can be recommended to traffic management departments. The experimental tests and analysis results revealed that the TGSEM is suitable. The proposed approach provides a generic framework with which to assess the performance of traffic guide signs and their effectiveness at intersections, including their experimental design, data analysis, the implementation of simulation models, and data interpretation.}

abstract = {This paper investigates relationships between traverses, delays and fatalities to road users at railway level crossings in Great Britain. A ‘traverse’ means a passage across a level crossing by a road user, who may be a pedestrian, cyclist, or occupant of a road vehicle. The paper finds that the road users with the highest fatality rate per traverse are pedestrians at passive crossings. Their rate is about three orders of magnitude higher than that of users with the lowest risk, who are road vehicle occupants at railway-controlled crossings. The paper considers the choice between automatic and railway-controlled crossings on public roads. Railway-controlled crossings are widely used in Britain. They are about one order of magnitude safer than automatic crossings, but they impose greater delays on users. A formula is developed to give the overall delay to road users at either type of crossing in terms of the numbers of road users and trains per day, and in terms of the length of time that the crossing must be closed to the road to allow the passage of one train. It is found that automatic level crossings cause substantially less delay than railway-controlled level crossings. The official monetary values of road user delay and of preventing a fatality were used to estimate the valuations of delays and fatalities at hypothetical but representative automatic and railway-controlled crossings. These valuations were then used to explore the effect of replacing representative railway-controlled with automatic crossings or vice-versa. It is found that the valuation of the reduced delays from adopting automatic crossings typically outweighs the valuation of the losses from the increased casualties. However, in practice Britain has chosen to retain a large number of railway-controlled crossings, which implies accepting the delays in return for a good level crossing safety record. Finally, an analysis is carried out to determine the additional risk of typical car and walk journeys that involve traversing a level crossing compared with similar journeys that do not. It is found that the additional risk is small for motor vehicle journeys, but substantial for walk journeys.}

abstract = {The precision and bias of Safety Performance Functions (SPFs) heavily rely on the data upon which they are estimated. When local (spatially and temporally representative) data are not sufficiently available, the estimated parameters in SPFs are likely to be biased and inefficient. Estimating SPFs using Bayesian inference may moderate the effects of local data insufficiency in that local data can be combined with prior information obtained from other parts of the world to incorporate additional evidence into the SPFs. In past applications of Bayesian models, non-informative priors have routinely been used because incorporating prior information in SPFs is not straightforward. The previous few attempts to employ informative priors in estimating SPFs are mostly based on local prior knowledge and assuming normally distributed priors. Moreover, the unobserved heterogeneity in local data has not been taken into account. As such, the effects of globally derived informative priors on the precision and bias of locally developed SPFs are essentially unknown. This study aims to examine the effects of globally informative priors and their distribution types on the precision and bias of SPFs developed for Australian crash data. To formulate and develop global informative priors, the means and variances of parameter estimates from previous research were critically reviewed. Informative priors were generated using three methods: 1) distribution fitting, 2) endogenous specification of dispersion parameters, and 3) hypothetically increasing the strength of priors obtained from distribution fitting. In so doing, the mean effects of crash contributing factors across the world are significantly different than those same effects in Australia. A total of 25 Bayesian Random Parameters Negative Binomial SPFs were estimated for different types of informative priors across five sample sizes. The means and standard deviations of posterior parameter estimates as well as SPFs goodness of fit were compared between the models across different sample sizes. Globally informative prior for the dispersion parameter substantially increases the precision of a local estimate, even when the variance of local data likelihood is small. In comparison with the conventional use of Normal distribution, Logistic, Weibull and Lognormal distributions yield more accurate parameter estimates for average annual daily traffic, segment length and number of lanes, particularly when sample size is relatively small.}

Accordingly, since the detection of accidents should be as rapid as possible, seven models are trained and tested for each machine learning technique, using traffic condition data from 1 to 7 min after the actual occurrence. The main sources of data used in this study consist of weather condition, accident, and loop detector data. Furthermore, to overcome the problem of imbalanced data (i.e., underrepresentation of accidents in the dataset), the Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE) is used. The results show that although SVM achieves overall higher accuracy, PNN outperforms SVM regarding the Detection Rate (DR) (i.e., percentage of correct accident detections). In addition, while both models perform best at 5 min after the occurrence of accidents, models trained at 3 or 4 min after the occurrence of an accident detect accidents more rapidly while performing reasonably well. Lastly, a sensitivity analysis of PNN for Time-To-Detection (TTD) reveals that the speed difference between upstream and downstream of accidents location is particularly significant to detect the occurrence of accidents.}

abstract = {Optimizing traffic signals in real-time for safety performance can be executable in the era of Connected Vehicles (CVs) when real-time information on vehicle positions and trajectories is available. To achieve this, real-time safety models are needed to understand how changes in signal controllers affect safety in real-time. Recently, several real-time safety models were developed for signalized intersections that relate various dynamic traffic parameters to the number of rear-end traffic conflicts at the signal cycle level. The traffic parameters included: traffic volume, maximum queue length, shock wave speed and area, and platoon ratio. For wider application of these models to other jurisdictions, the transferability of these models needs to be examined. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the transferability of several signalized intersections real-time safety models to new jurisdictions. Two corridors of signalized intersections in California and Atlanta were used in the analysis as destination jurisdictions. Detailed vehicle trajectories for these corridors were obtained from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) data. Various transferability analysis approaches were applied. The transferability of the real-time safety models was evaluated with and without a local calibration for the model parameters at the new jurisdictions. Several goodness-of-fit measures were examined to assess the ability of the developed models to predict traffic conflicts. Overall, the results showed that the real-time safety models are transferable, which confirms the validity of using them for real-time safety evaluation of signalized intersections.}

Nearly all studies find safety-in-numbers, but the numerical estimates vary considerably. As virtually all studies are cross-sectional, it is not possible to determine if safety-in-numbers represents a causal relationship. Meta-regression analysis was performed to identify factors which may explain the large heterogeneity of estimates of safety-in-numbers. It was found that safety-in-numbers tends to be stronger for pedestrians than for cyclists, and stronger at the macro-level (e.g. citywide) than at the micro-level (e.g. in junctions). Recent studies find a stronger tendency towards safety-in-numbers than older studies.}

Thus, we are interested in predicting fatal motorcycle accidents (FMAs), and in identifying their key factors and possible causes. Accurate prediction of YD FMAs from data by risk minimization using the 0/1 loss function (i.e., the ordinary classification accuracy) cannot be guaranteed because these accidents are only ∼1% of all YD motorcycle accidents, and classifiers tend to focus on the majority class of minor accidents at the expense of the minority class of fatal ones. Also, classifiers are usually uninformative (providing no information about the distribution of misclassifications), insensitive to error severity (making no distinction between misclassification of fatal accidents as severe or minor), and limited in identifying key factors. We propose to use an information measure (IM) that jointly maximizes accuracy and information and is sensitive to the error distribution and severity. Using a database of ∼3600 motorcycle accidents, a Bayesian network classifier optimized by IM predicted FMAs better than classifiers maximizing accuracy or other predictive or information measures, and identified fatal accident key factors and causal relations.}

As long as the automated vehicle technology has not achieved full automation (Level 5), human drivers are still expected to take over the steering wheel and throttles when there is an automated vehicle disengagement. However, contributing factors and the mechanism about automated vehicle-initiated disengagement has not been quantitatively and comprehensively explored and investigated due to the lack of field test data. Besides, understanding human drivers’ perception and promptness of reaction to the AV disengagement is essential to ensure safety transition between automated and manual driving. By harnessing California’s Autonomous Vehicle Disengagement Report Database, which includes the AV disengagement data from field tests in 2016–2017, this paper quantitatively investigated the AV disengagement using multiple statistical modeling approaches that involve statistical modeling and classification tree. Specifically, the paper identifies the contributing factors impacting human drivers’ promptness to AV disengagements, and quantitatively investigates the underlying causes to AV disengagements. Results indicate that current AV disengagement on public roads is dominated by causes due to a planning issue. The cause of an AV disengagement is significantly induced by lacking certain numbers of radar and LiDAR sensors installed on the automated vehicles. These thresholds of these sensors needed are revealed. Cause of disengagement and roadway characteristics significantly impact drivers’ take-over time when facing an AV disengagement. AV perception or control issue-based disengagement can significantly extend drivers’ perception-reaction time to take over the driving. The quantitative knowledge obtained ultimately facilitates revealing the mechanisms of the automated vehicle disengagements to ensure safe AV operations on public roads.}

Through integrating the calibrated models into one simulation platform, the stochastic behavior of vehicles and pedestrians under different geometric layouts and operational conditions can be reproduced. Based on the field data collected by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) at two urban intersections in Beijing, China, it was demonstrated through validation of surrogate safety measures (SSMs), i.e., Post Encroachment Time (PET) and vehicle passing speed at conflict points, that the simulation model can reasonably represent the frequency and severity of conflict occurrence at signalized crosswalks. The sensitivity analysis results indicated that large dimensions and turning angles of intersections tend to result in undesirable safety performance.}

This study presents a research framework for key feature selection and risk prediction of car’s LC behavior on the highway based on vehicles’ trajectory dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that focuses on key feature selection and risk prediction for LC behavior on the highway. From the vehicles’ trajectory dataset, we extract car’s candidate features and apply fault tree analysis and k-Means clustering algorithm to determine the LC risk level based on the performance indicator of Crash Potential Index (CPI). Random Forest (RF) classifier is applied to select key features from car’s candidate features and predict LC risk level. This study also proposes a method to evaluate the resampling methods to resample the LC risk dataset in terms of fitness performance and prediction performance. The cars’ trajectory data collected from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset is used for framework development and verification. The sensitivity analysis of CPI indicates that the following cars in the original lane and target lane are respectively the safest and riskiest cars of the surrounding cars in an LC event. The results of resampling method evaluation show that SMOTETomek, which is less likely to be overfitting and has high prediction performance, is well suited for resampling the LC risk dataset on which RF classifier is trained. The results of key feature selection imply that the individual behaviors of the LC car and its surrounding cars in the original lane, the interactions between the LC car and its surrounding cars, and the interactions between the surrounding cars in the target lane (especially the interaction of the cars’ accelerations) are of importance to the LC risk.}

Though walking is a major component of urban mobility, the high rate of fatal interaction with motor vehicle traffic raises safety issues around how pedestrians decide to accept the available gap. This paper explored these interactions by modeling gap acceptance behavior at the midblock crosswalks. Unlike other pedestrian gap acceptance studies that focus on individual psychological and sociological factors that are difficult to control or manage, this study focused on six environmental factors that we considered important and as having the potential to affect the pedestrians’ gap acceptance decision at the crosswalks, i.e. gap size, crossing distance, number of waiting pedestrians, waiting time, vehicle traffic volume and position of pedestrian (whether on street kerb or median). Video data was collected on pedestrian gap acceptance from 13 midblock crosswalk locations in Shanghai, China. A Logit model with 96% accuracy was developed to describe and predict the pedestrian gap acceptance behaviors. The results show that gap size and crossing distance have the highest effect on the pedestrian gap acceptance decision. Pedestrians waiting at the kerbside could confidently accept gaps (with a 95% probability) when the gap is longer than 2.2s, 5.9s, and 9.6s under the condition that the crossing distance is 4 m (one lane), 7.5 m (two lanes), and 11 m (three lanes), respectively while pedestrians waiting at the median could confidently accept gaps when the gap is longer than 1.6s, 5.3s, and 8.5s respectively under the same conditions. The recommendations on improving the crossing safety are proposed accordingly.}

abstract = {Background
Poor hazard perception, or the ability to anticipate potentially dangerous road and traffic situations, has been linked to an increased crash risk. Novice and younger road users are typically poorer at hazard perception than experienced and older road users. Road traffic authorities have recognised the importance of hazard perception skills, with the inclusion of a hazard perception test in most Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) systems.
Objectives
This review synthesises studies of hazard perception tests in order to determine best practice methodologies that discriminate between novice/younger and experienced/older road users.
Data sources
Published studies available on PsychInfo, Scopus and Medline as at April 2018 were included in the review. Studies included a hazard perception test methodology and compared non-clinical populations of road users (car drivers, motorcyclists, bicyclists and pedestrians), based on age and experience, or compared methodologies.
Results
49 studies met the inclusion criteria. There was a high degree of heterogeneity in the studies. However all methodologies – video, static image, simulator and real-world test-drive were able to discriminate road user groups categorised by age and/or experience, on at least one measure of hazard perception.
Conclusions
Whilst there was a high level of heterogeneity of studies, video methodology utilising temporal responses (e.g. press a button when detecting the potential hazard) are a consistent measure of hazard perception across road user groups, whereas spatial measures (e.g. locate potential hazard in the scenario) were inconsistent. Staged footage was found to discriminate as well as unstaged footage, with static images also adding valuable information on hazard perception. There were considerable inconsistencies in the categorising of participants based on age and experience, limited application of theoretical frameworks, and a considerable lack of detail regarding post hoc amendments of hazardous scenarios. This research can guide further developments in hazard perception testing that may improve driver licensing and outcomes for road users.}

In this study, an optimal model based on the best combination of risk factors according to the Akaike information criterion (AIC) was developed. Additionally, a secondary GPS model using only crash site characteristics that can be derived from GPS coordinates from the crash scene was also developed. The optimal model is based on site and environmental conditions that could be derived from GPS data (posted speed limit, distance from crash site, natural lighting conditions, road geometry, road horizontal alignment and road vertical alignment) as well as pedestrian age/gender, driver age/gender and vehicle model year. The second model only included features that could be derived from GPS data. The optimal model was reasonable in accuracy and gave an under-triage rate of 10% when the injury threshold was set to 15%, with a corresponding over-triage rate of around 60%. The GPS model, despite not being as accurate as the optimal model may be adequate in the absence of all the risk factors required for the optimal model, requiring an injury threshold of 20% to give an under-triage rate of 10%, with the corresponding over-triage rate being around 70%. Both models can potentially be used for serious injury risk prediction (SIRP) for pedestrians involved in a collision with a vehicle.}

This paper compares and contrasts the two types of studies and aims to provide reasons for the differences in findings that have been documented. A comprehensive review of literature and consultations with human factors experts highlighted that simulator studies tend to show degradation in driving performance, suggestive of increased crash risk as a result of mobile phone conversation. Whilst NDSs, at times, present data suggesting that mobile phone conversation distraction actually reduces crash risk. This study identifies that these differences may be attributed to behavioural hypotheses associated with driver self-regulation, arousal from cognitive loading, task displacement and gaze concentration – all of which need to be explicitly tested in future driving studies. Metric estimation and application was also revealed to be polarising results and the subsequent assessment of the crash risk. A common metric applied in this domain is the ‘Odds Ratio’, particularly prevalent in NDSs. This study presents a detailed investigation into the assumptions and application of the Odds Ratio which revealed the potential for over- and under-estimation of the metric depending on the core data and sampling assumptions. Furthermore, this research presents a comparative analysis of select driving simulator studies and an NDS considering only driving behaviour data as a means to consistently compare the findings of both methodologies. The findings from this investigation implores the need for greater consistency in the application of analysis methods and metrics across both simulator and NDSs. Improvements can yield a more robust platform to systematically compare and interpret data across both approaches, ultimately leading to enhanced planning and safety regarding mobile phone use while driving.}

The mixed logit model is subsequently developed on each cluster to account for the within-class unobserved heterogeneity and to further analyze the dataset.

abstract = {Speeding is one of the major contributors to traffic crashes. To solve this problem, speeding prediction is recognized as a critical step in a pre-warning system. While previous studies have shown that speeding is affected by road environmental design, research in predicting speeding behavior through road environment features has not yet been conducted. Furthermore, there is a large discrepancy between actual and perceived road environmental information given that a driver’s visual perception plays a crucial role as the dominant source of information in determining driver’s behavior. Thus, this paper aims to establish a speeding prediction model based on quantifying the visual road environment to improve the design of pre-waring systems, which can predict whether drivers are going to speed and provide them with visual or/and audio warnings about their current driving speed and the speed limit prior to the occurrence of speeding behavior. Twenty input variables derived from three categories including visual road environment parameters, vehicle kinematic features, and driver characteristics were considered in the proposed speeding prediction model. Especially, the road environmental design factors consisting of the visual road geometry and visual roadside environment as perceived by the driver’s eyes were quantified using a visual road environment model. Field experiments were conducted to collect naturalistic driving data concerning speeding behavior on the typical two-lane mountainous rural highways in five provinces of China. Random Forests, an ensemble learning method for regression and classification, were applied to build the speeding prediction model and variable importance was calculated. Additionally, logistic regression was used as a supplement to further investigate factors impacting on speeding behavior. A speeding criterion was defined with two levels in this study: a lower level (exceeding the posted speed limit) and a higher level (10% above the posted speed limit). Under both levels of the speeding criterion, the speeding prediction model performed well with high accuracy (over 85%). This model could use the value of the variables obtained from the current position to predict drivers’ speeding behavior at the future position located a sighting distance away. This interval was sufficient for a pre-warning system to give a speeding warning that a driver with normal perception-reaction time (around 2.5 s) could respond to. Findings in this study can be used to effectively predict speeding in advance and help to reduce speeding-related traffic accidents.}

Fuzzy logic rules of safety indicators at critical braking onset for risk classification were then extracted according to the clustered risk levels. The safety indicators include time to collision, time headway, and final relative distance under emergency braking, which characterizes three kinds of uncertain critical conditions respectively. Finally, the obtained fuzzy risk level classification algorithm was tested and compared with other Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) algorithms under Euro-NCAP testing scenarios in simulation. Results show the proposed algorithm is promising in balancing the objectives of avoiding collision and reducing interference with driver’s normal driving compared with other algorithms.}

A total of 6824 bridges recording in total 1368 accidents were included. Although almost 90% of the bridges recorded zero accidents, there is no evidence of an excessive number of zeros, often referred to as “zero-inflation”. Traffic volume, stated as AADT (Annual Average Daily Traffic), was found to be the single most important factor influencing the number of accidents. It explained nearly 72% of the systematic variation in the number of accidents. The number of accidents increased less than proportionately with traffic volume, meaning that accidents per million vehicle kilometres declined with increasing traffic volume. Long bridges were found to be safer than short bridges and recently built bridges were safer than older bridges. Based on in-depth studies, a more detailed analysis of factors associated with fatal accidents was performed.}

It is suggested that engineering ethics can provide engineers with the necessary guidelines to avoid possible accidents arising from their decisions and actions. In addition, the Challenger and Columbia space shuttle case studies that demonstrate the role of engineering ethics in the prevention and occurrence of accidents are discussed. Then sequential, epidemiological, and systemic accident analysis models are briefly investigated and negligence of engineering ethics as a gap in the accident analysis models is described.

The present study investigated whether participants could accurately perceive gap affordances via information that specifies the time-to-arrival of the approaching cars. To ensure the opportunities for action were the same across different age groups, independent of the actor’s action capabilities, the action of crossing the road was standardised. A total of 45 participants (15 children, aged 10–12, 15 adults aged 19–39, 15 older adults aged 65+) were asked to judge, by pressing a button in a head-mounted display, whether the gap between oncoming cars afforded crossing. When the participant pressed the button, they moved across the road at a fixed speed. Adherence to a time-based variable (namely tau) explained 85% and 84% of the variance in both the children and adults’ choices, respectively. Older adults tuned less into the time-based variable (tau) with it only accounting for 59% of the variance in road-crossing decisions. These findings suggest that, the ability to use tau information which specifies whether a gap affords crossing or not, deteriorates with age.}

As a consequence, vehicles keep longer headways or frequently change lane when they follow a truck, which is expected to increase crash risk. This study introduces several traffic measures at the individual vehicle level to capture vehicle interactions between trucks and non-trucks and analyzed how the measures affect crash risk under different traffic conditions. The traffic measures were developed using headways obtained from Inductive Loop Detectors (ILDs). In addition, a truck detection algorithm using a Gaussian Mixture (GM) model was developed to identify trucks and to estimate truck exposure from ILD data. Using the identified vehicle types from the GM model, vehicle interaction metrics were categorized into three groups based on the combination of leading and following vehicle types. The effects of the proposed traffic measures on crash risk were modeled in two different cases of prior- and non-crash using a case-control approach utilizing a conditional logistic regression. Results showed that the vehicle interactions between the leading and following vehicle types were highly associated with crash risk, and further showed different impacts on crash risk by traffic conditions. Specifically, crashes were more likely to occur when a truck following a non-truck had shorter average headway but greater headway variance in heavy traffic while a non-truck following a truck had greater headway variance in light traffic. This study obtained meaningful conclusions that vehicle interactions involved with trucks were significantly related to the crash likelihood rather than the measures that estimate average traffic condition such as total volume or average headway of the traffic stream.}

They are designed to prevent occupants from hitting objects inside their vehicle and from being ejected out of their vehicle in the event of a crash. Despite their proven effectiveness in reducing the severity of injuries, seatbelt non-use among passengers still remains a problem, especially at night. Although the factors associated with not using a seatbelt have been widely studied, research studies documenting this behavior at night are limited in the literature. The primary objective of this paper is to explore the factors related to front-seat passengers’ seatbelt non-use at night using a 2015–2016 longitudinal observation survey conducted in five counties in East Tennessee. The Generalized Estimating Equation, a rigorous modeling technique, is employed for the data analysis. The findings show that front-seat passengers who are most likely to not wear seatbelts at night are males, traveling in passenger cars and pickup trucks, traveling during the first half of the year (January to June), traveling late at night (after 10 p.m) and on local streets. The findings also indicate that drivers may have the greatest influence on their accompanying passengers’ seatbelt use. That is, when drivers fail to wear seatbelts at night, their accompanying front-seat passengers are more likely to fail as well. The model results show that there are many consistent correlations between the non-use of seatbelts and personal, vehicle and environmental characteristics. Accounting for these factors may be important when developing intervention strategies that promote nighttime seatbelt use.}

abstract = {Numerous studies have examined the influence of rainfall on the relative risk of crash, and they all agree that rainfall leads to an increase in relative risk as compared to dry conditions; what they do not agree on is the magnitude of these increases. Here we consider three methodological decisions made in computing the relative risk and examine their impacts: the inclusion or exclusion of zero total events (where no crashes occur during event or control periods), the temporal scale of analysis, and the use of information on pavement and weather conditions contained with the crash reports to determine relative risk. Our analyses are based on several years of data from six U.S. states (Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota and Ohio). Zero total events in the context of weather related crash studies typically provide no information on the actual crash odds and greatly alter the distribution of relative risk estimates and should be removed from the analysis. While the use of a daily time step provides an estimate of relative risk that is not significantly different from an hourly time step for the majority of rural counties in our study area, the same is true of only 39% of the urban counties. Finally, the use of pavement and weather condition information from the crash reports results in relative risk estimates that are lower than the standard approach, however this difference decreases as rainfall totals increase. By highlighting the influence of methodological choices, we hope to pave the way towards the potential reduction in uncertainties in weather-related relative risk estimates.}

Whatever the method used for estimating the number or serious injuries, at some point it is always necessary to use hospital records. The aim of this paper is to understand the implications for (1) in/exclusion criteria applied to case selection and (2) a methodological approach for converting ICD (International Classification of Diseases/Injuries) to MAIS codes, when estimating the number of road traffic serious injuries from hospital data. A descriptive analysis with hospital data from Spain and the Netherlands was carried out to examine the effect of certain choices concerning in- and exclusion criteria based on codes of the ICD9-CM and ICD10. The main parameters explored were: deaths before and after 30 days, readmissions, and external injury causes. Additionally, an analysis was done to explore the impact of using different conversion tools to derive MAIS3 + using data from Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Netherlands, and Spain. Recommendations are given regarding the in/exclusion criteria and when there is incomplete data to ascertain a road injury, weighting factors could be used to correct data deviations and make more real estimations.}

Crash reports aim to answer the five “W” questions (i.e. When?, Where?, What?, Who? and Why?) of each crash by including a range of attributes. This paper reviews current literature on the state of crash data quality for each of these questions separately. The most serious data quality issues appear to be: inaccuracies in crash location and time, difficulties in data linkage (e.g. with traffic data) due to inconsistencies in databases, severity misclassification, inaccuracies and incompleteness of involved users’ demographics and inaccurate identification of crash contributory factors. It is shown that the extent and the severity of data quality issues are not equal between attributes and the level of impact in road safety analyses is not yet entirely known. This paper highlights areas that require further research and provides some suggestions for the development of intelligent crash reporting systems.}

The crowdsourced traffic safety data comprise of both self-reported crashes as well as perceived hazardous locations. The results of the crash data analysis reveal that police-reported crashes underrepresent non-motorized safety concerns in and around the campus regions. The spatial distribution of police-reported crashes shows that police-reported crashes are predominantly unavailable inside the main campus areas, and the off-campus crashes over-represent automobile involvement. In comparison, the self-reported crash results report a wide variety of off-campus collisions not involving automobiles, while also highlighting the issue of high crash concentrations along campus boundaries. An assessment of the perceived hazardous locations (PHLs) reveals that high concentrations of such observations at/near a given location have statistically significant association with both survey-reported crashes as well as future police-reported crashes. Moreover, the results indicate the presence of a saturation point in the relationship between crashes and PHLs wherein beyond a certain limit, an increasing number of traffic safety concerns may not necessarily correlate with a proportional increase in the number of crashes. These findings suggests that augmenting our existing knowledge of traffic safety through crowdsourcing techniques can potentially help in better estimating both existing as well as emerging traffic safety concerns.}

This paper investigates the location and time of a potential secondary accident after the occurrence of an initial traffic accident. With accident data and traffic loop data collected over three years from California interstate freeways, a shock wave-based method was introduced to identify secondary accidents. A linear regression model and two machine learning algorithms, including a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and a least squares support vector machine (LSSVM), were implemented to explore the distance and time gap between the initial and secondary accidents using inputs of crash severity, violation category, weather condition, tow away, road surface condition, lighting, parties involved, traffic volume, duration, and shock wave speed generated by the primary accident. From the results, the linear regression model was inadequate in describing the effect of most variables and its goodness-of-fit and accuracy in prediction was relatively poor. In the training programs, the BPNN and LSSVM demonstrated adequate goodness-of-fit, though the BPNN was superior with a higher CORR and lower MSE. The BPNN model also outperformed the LSSVM in time prediction, while both failed to provide adequate distance prediction. Therefore, the BPNN model could be used to forecast the time gap between initial and secondary accidents, which could be used by decision makers and incident management agencies to prevent or reduce secondary collisions.}

Bicycle count data, though increasingly more available, still represents a fraction of the available count data for automobiles. Further compounding on this, bicycle demand estimation methods often require more data than automobiles to account for the high variability that bicycle demand is subject to.

In such cases, the binary dependent variable is characterized by dozens to thousands of times fewer events (crashes) than non-events (non-crashes). This paper attempts to add to the current knowledge by investigating crash likelihood by utilizing real-time traffic data and by proposing a framework driven by appropriate statistical models (Bias Correction and Firth method) in order to overcome the problems that arise when the number of crashes is very low. Under this approach instead of using traditional logistic regression methods, crashes are considered as rare events In order to demonstrate this approach, traffic data were collected from three random loop detectors in the Attica Tollway (“Attiki Odos”) located in Greater Athens Area in Greece for the 2008–2011 period. The traffic dataset consists of hourly aggregated traffic data such as flow, occupancy, mean time speed and percentage of trucks in traffic. This study demonstrates the application and findings of our approach and revealed a negative relationship between crash occurrence and speed in crash locations. The method and findings of the study attempt to provide insights on the mechanism of crash occurrence and also to overcome data considerations for the first time in safety evaluation of motorways.}

abstract = {Most of the decisions taken to improve road safety are based on accident data, which makes it the back bone of any country’s road safety system. Errors in this data will lead to misidentification of black spots and hazardous road segments, projection of false estimates pertinent to accidents and fatality rates, and detection of wrong parameters responsible for accident occurrence, thereby making the entire road safety exercise ineffective. Its extent varies from country to country depending upon various factors. Knowing the type of error in the accident data and the factors causing it enables the application of the correct method for its rectification. Therefore there is a need for a systematic literature review that addresses the topic at a global level. This paper fulfils the above research gap by providing a synthesis of literature for the different types of errors found in the accident data of 46 countries across the six regions of the world. The errors are classified and discussed with respect to each type and analysed with respect to income level; assessment with regard to the magnitude for each type is provided; followed by the different causes that result in their occurrence, and the various methods used to address each type of error. Among high-income countries the extent of error in reporting slight, severe, non-fatal and fatal injury accidents varied between 39–82%, 16–52%, 12–84%, and 0–31% respectively. For middle-income countries the error for the same categories varied between 93–98%, 32.5–96%, 34–99% and 0.5–89.5% respectively. The only four studies available for low-income countries showed that the error in reporting non-fatal and fatal accidents varied between 69–80% and 0–61% respectively. The logistic relation of error in accident data reporting, dichotomised at 50%, indicated that as the income level of a country increases the probability of having less error in accident data also increases. Average error in recording information related to the variables in the categories of location, victim’s information, vehicle’s information, and environment was 27%, 37%, 16% and 19% respectively. Among the causes identified for errors in accident data reporting, Policing System was found to be the most important. Overall 26 causes of errors in accident data were discussed out of which 12 were related to reporting and 14 were related to recording. “Capture-Recapture” was the most widely used method among the 11 different methods: that can be used for the rectification of under-reporting. There were 12 studies pertinent to the rectification of accident location and almost all of them utilised a Geographical Information System (GIS) platform coupled with a matching algorithm to estimate the correct location. It is recommended that the policing system should be reformed and public awareness should be created to help reduce errors in accident data.}

abstract = {First step of the development of an effective safety management system is to create reliable crash databases since the quality of decision making in road safety depends on the quality of the data on which decisions are based. Improving crash data is a worldwide priority, as highlighted in the Global Plan for the Decade of Action for Road Safety adopted by the United Nations, which recognizes that the overall goal of the plan will be attained improving the quality of data collection at the national, regional and global levels. Crash databases provide the basic information for effective highway safety efforts at any level of government, but lack of uniformity among countries and among the different jurisdictions in the same country is observed. Several existing databases show significant drawbacks which hinder their effective use for safety analysis and improvement. Furthermore, modern technologies offer great potential for significant improvements of existing methods and procedures for crash data collection, processing and analysis. To address these issues, in this paper we present the development and evaluation of a web-based platform-independent software for crash data collection, processing and analysis. The software is designed for mobile and desktop electronic devices and enables a guided and automated drafting of the crash report, assisting police officers both on-site and in the office. The software development was based both on the detailed critical review of existing Australasian, EU, and U.S. crash databases and software as well as on the continuous consultation with the stakeholders. The evaluation was carried out comparing the completeness, timeliness, and accuracy of crash data before and after the use of the software in the city of Vico Equense, in south of Italy showing significant advantages. The amount of collected information increased from 82 variables to 268 variables, i.e., a 227% increase. The time saving was more than one hour per crash, i.e., a 36% reduction. The on-site data collection did not produce time saving, however this is a temporary weakness that will be annihilated very soon in the future after officers are more acquainted with the software. The phase of evaluation, processing and analysis carried out in the office was dramatically shortened, i.e., a 69% reduction. Another benefit was the standardization which allowed fast and consistent data analysis and evaluation. Even if all these benefits are remarkable, the most valuable benefit of the new procedure was the reduction of the police officers mistakes during the manual operations of survey and data evaluation. Because of these benefits, the satisfaction questionnaires administrated to the police officers after the testing phase showed very good acceptance of the procedure.}

This study focuses on macroscopic properties of road safety statistics and the temporal stability of these statistics at a global level. A thorough investigation of two years of measurements was conducted to identify any unexpected gaps that could highlight the existence of inconsistent measurements. The database used in this research includes 121 member countries of the United Nation (UN-121) with a population of at least one million (smaller country data shows higher instability) and includes road safety and socioeconomic variables collected from a number of international databases (e.g. WHO and World Bank) for the years 2010 and 2013. For the fulfillment of the earlier stated goal, a number of data visualization and exploratory analyses (Hierarchical Clustering and Principal Component Analysis) were conducted. Furthermore, in order to provide a richer analysis of the data, we developed and compared the specification of a number of Structural Equation Models for the years 2010 and 2013. Different scenarios have been developed, with different endogenous variables (indicators of mortality rate and fatality risk) and structural forms. The findings of the current research indicate inconsistency phenomena in global statistics of different instances/years. Finally, the results of this research provide evidence on the importance of careful and systematic data collection for developing advanced statistical and econometric techniques and furthermore for developing road safety policies.}

With a view to addressing the growing concern of pedestrian safety, Federal and local governments aim at reducing pedestrian-involved crashes. Nevertheless, pedestrian volume data are rarely available even though they among the most important factors to identify pedestrian safety. Thus, this study aims at identifying surrogate measures for pedestrian exposure at intersections. A two-step process is implemented: the first step is the development of Tobit and generalized linear models for predicting pedestrian trips (i.e., exposure models). In the second step, negative binomial and zero inflated negative binomial models were developed for pedestrian crashes using the predicted pedestrian trips. The results indicate that among various exposure models the Tobit model performs the best in describing pedestrian exposure. The identified exposure-relevant factors are the presence of schools, car-ownership, pavement condition, sidewalk width, bus ridership, intersection control type and presence of sidewalk barrier. It was also found that the negative binomial model with the predicted pedestrian trips and that with the observed pedestrian trips perform equally well for estimating pedestrian crashes. Also, the difference between the observed and the predicted pedestrian trips does not appear as statistically significant, according to the results of the t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. It is expected that the methodologies using predicted pedestrian trips or directly including pedestrian surrogate exposure variables can estimate safety performance functions for pedestrian crashes even though when pedestrian trip data is not available.}

The first step includes a spatial analysis method called network kernel density estimation (KDE). The second step is a network screening method using the critical crash rate, which it described in the Highway Safety Manual (HSM). The method was examined by using three years of TAs (2011–2013) in Sherbrooke, Canada. The network KDE uses TAs to graphically display sites with a high crash density. Two different crash patterns were used for identifying these locations: (1) a crash pattern that includes three-year aggregated crash data, and (2) a crash pattern that involves three-year merged crash data. The results of the two crash patterns were evaluated based on a prediction accuracy index (PAI). It was found that the results obtained from the merged crash data outperformed the other. On the other hand, crash clustering in a site does not imply a site is hotspot and it is better to tested by other factors. High crash density locations were then tested by the critical crash rate, which helps to create an accurate comparison of sites. The importance of the critical crash rate is that it takes several factors into account such as the amount of exposure, the type of intersection, variance in crash data, etc. We realized that the hotspots determined using the two methods reflect very problematic locations and filter out the locations that do not have a problem. This approach could help transportation authorities and safety specialists to identify and prioritize sites that require more safety attention.}

abstract = {Shared-bicycle use has skyrocketed in urban China, but little is known about the safety of bicycle users. The Chinese popular media reports multiple risky riding behaviors among shared bicycle riders, but scientific research on the topic is lacking. Therefore, we conducted a retrospective WeChat-based online survey to examine how often shared bicycle riders report engaging in risky cycling behaviors in urban China. Eight unsafe shared bicycle riding behaviors were assessed: not wearing helmets, running red lights, cycling against the traffic flow, riding in lanes designed for motor vehicles, riding in lanes designed for pedestrians, carrying passengers on bicycles, using cell phones while riding, and eating while riding. In total, 1960 valid questionnaires were collected. The proportion of participants who reported always or often having unsafe riding behavior in the past month, ranged from 1.1% for carrying passengers on the bicycles to 97.6% for failing to wear a helmet. Demographic characteristics were associated with unsafe behaviors through multivariate logistic regression, with male riders and riders aged 25 years or younger more likely to ride while using cell phones than females (AOR = 2.94) and those 36 years or older (AOR = 3.57). Cyclists with undergraduate education were more likely to wear helmets than those with postgraduate education or higher (AOR = 0.21). Compared to riders from central municipalities governed directly by the central government, riders from provincial capitals, deputy provincial cities, and smaller cities were at higher risks of riding in lanes for pedestrians, respectively (AOR = 1.59, 2.82 and 1.61). Riders who rode over 5 h a week and who rode on weekends were more likely to carry passengers than those who rode less than 1 h a week (AOR = 4.72) and those who rode only on weekdays (AOR = 3.93). We conclude that shared-bicycle riders frequently engage in some unsafe riding behaviors in urban China. Younger age, lower level of education, and longer hours of riding each week are associated with greater risks of some unsafe riding behaviors. Shared bicycles offer substantial benefit to societal health and transportation, but evidence-based interventions should be considered to reduce risks from unsafe shared bicycle riding behaviors. A well-designed road infrastructure with dedicated on-road bicycle lanes and readily-accessible comfortable, low-cost, and safe helmets may also reduce unsafe riding behaviors and unwanted crashes and injuries for shared bicycle riders.}

abstract = {Introduction
Several studies of the working conditions of drivers, and in particular on their pace of work, have enabled a better understanding of the risk factors for road accidents that occur during work. However, few studies are available on the risk exposure and working conditions of employees whose occupations involve driving. The purpose of this paper is to identify the different groups of employees occupationally exposed to road risk and to classify them according to working conditions.
Methodology
A Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) was implemented on the 41,727 individuals from the SUMER 2010 survey (Medical Monitoring of Occupational Risk Exposure: SUrveillance Médicale des Expositions aux Risques professionnels) and for 45 variables about working conditions. The analysis used 5 categories of weekly driving exposure as a supplementary variable (variable which is not used to perform the MCA): Non-exposure; Exposed <2 h; Exposed 2–10 hours; Exposed 10–20 hours; and Exposed >20 h. The results of the MCA were used to construct an ascending hierarchical classification.
Results
The first factorial axis differentiates between conventional and unconventional work schedules. Axis 2 differentiates modalities corresponding to the working hours of the most recent working week. The third axis chiefly contrasts persons who have rules to follow with those who have none. An ascending hierarchical classification distinguishes 10 clusters of individuals according to working conditions. Four clusters of employees were excessively exposed to occupational driving. Clusters also have distinct demographic, occupational and psychosocial characteristics.
Conclusion
Analysis of data from the SUMER survey confirms that employees exposed to road risk are particularly affected by atypical work time characteristics, but can be found in all activity sectors and in all types of job.}

abstract = {Introduction
Efforts to encourage bicycling to school have increased in the United States. However, little is known about how parent-child communication affects bicycle safety. The purpose of this study was to examine parent-child agreement on biking instructions and their correlation with the early adolescents’ real-world riding behavior.
Methods
Parent-child dyads were asked open-ended questions about instructions they had given/received about bicycling. Answers were then coded into nine categories (e.g., crossing the road, bicycle control/handling). Distributions of parent-child agreement on parent-given bicycle safety instructions were examined in relation to the adolescent’s real-world riding behaviors.
Results
36 parent-child dyads were included. Average age was 11.9 (Range: 10–15) for adolescents and 43.3 (Range: 30–59) for parents. Common parental instructions included: wear helmet, ride on sidewalk, and trip routing specifications. High ‘ride on sidewalk’ instruction (38.9% both parent and adolescent, 22.2% parent only, 16.7% adolescent only) was concerning due to potential driveway conflicts. Agreement between parents and adolescents on reported instructions was low, overall. Mean safety-relevant event rates in real-world cycling did not differ significantly between bicycle safety instruction agreement groups (both parent \& adolescent reported, parent only, adolescent only, neither). The proportion of time an adolescent rode on different infrastructure types (sidewalk, street, etc.) did not vary between dyads reporting parents had given instructions to ride on the sidewalk and those who had not.
Conclusions
Results highlight lack of agreement between parents and adolescents on cycling instructions the adolescent receives from the parent. Parent instructions to adolescents regarding bicycling safety were not associated with actual riding behaviors. Results suggest parent messaging to adolescents may be ineffective. Given parents are in a position of influence, results indicate a need for parental training on effective safety-related communication strategies to assist them in capitalizing on their parental role to increase their child’s safety.}

Over recent years, there has been an increase in the number of published studies examining driver anger, particularly using the Driving Anger Scale (DAS). The DAS measures six broad types of situations likely to provoke anger while driving (i.e., police presence, illegal driving, discourtesy, traffic obstructions, slower drivers, and hostile gestures). The majority of the recent studies have moved away from traditional paper-and-pencil methodologies, using the internet to collect data, for reasons of convenience. However, it is not yet completely clear whether data obtained from this methodology differs from more traditional methods. While research outside of the driving arena has not found substantial differences, it is important to establish whether this also applies to driving-related research and measures, such as the DAS. The present study used Multigroup Confirmatory Factor Analysis (MGCFA) to investigate the invariance of the DAS across a random sample from the electoral roll (n = 1,081: males = 45%) and an internet sourced sample (n = 627; males = 55%). The MGCFA showed the same six-factor solution was supported in both datasets. The relationships between the DAS factors and age, sex, trait anger, and annual mileage were broadly similar, although more significant differences were identified in the internet sample. This research demonstrates that driving measures administered over the internet produce similar results to those obtained using more traditional methods.}

First, focus groups were conducted with 60 drivers between the ages of 17 and 25 years who resided in Queensland, Australia. This qualitative study utilised an inductive approach to elicit participants’ perceptions without omitting important ideas. Legal sanctions were associated with low perceptions of enforcement certainty. Meanwhile, the only non-legal sanction to emerge was the concept of “safety”; many participants were deterred from using their phone while driving for fear of injury or death to themselves or others. The types of social media most likely to be engaged in were explored and sending videos or photos via the application Snapchat emerged as the most common social media application used among the sample. Consequently, the subsequent quantitative study focused on deterrent forces associated with Snapchat use while driving. A survey was utilised with a separate sample of young drivers aged 17–25 years (n = 503). The impact of the threat of legal sanctions on Snapchat use while driving was examined through classical deterrence theory and Stafford and Warr’s (1993) reconceptualised deterrence theory. The non-legal factor of perceived safety was also included in the quantitative study. None of the classical deterrence variables (e.g., certainty, severity and swiftness) reached significance while all the reconceptualised deterrence variables (e.g., direct and indirect punishment and punishment avoidance), as well as perceived safety, were significant predictors of Snapchat use while driving. It is suggested that perceptions of certainty of apprehension need to be increased for phone use while driving. The findings show the current impact of deterrent initiatives for phone use while driving as well as provide the first examination of deterrents for the specific mobile phone behaviour of Snapchat use while driving.}

Research studies need to be conducted in order to identify the contributing factors and develop countermeasures to improve safety for pedestrians. However, due to the heterogeneity inherent in crash data, which arises from unobservable factors that are not reported by law enforcement agencies and/or cannot be collected from state crash records, it is not easy to identify and evaluate factors that affect the injury severity of pedestrians in such crashes. By taking advantage of the latent class clustering (LCC), this research firstly applies the LCC approach to identify the latent classes and classify the crashes with different distribution characteristics of contributing factors to the pedestrian-vehicle crashes. By considering the inherent ordered nature of the traffic crash severity data, a partial proportional odds (PPO) model is then developed and utilized to explore the major factors that significantly affect the pedestrian injury severities resulting from pedestrian-vehicle crashes for each latent class previously obtained in the LCC. This study uses police reported pedestrian crash data collected from 2007 to 2014 in North Carolina, containing a variety of features of motorist, pedestrian, environmental, roadway characteristics. Parameter estimates and associated marginal effects are mainly used to interpret the models and evaluate the significance of each independent variable. Lastly, policy recommendations are made and future research directions are also given.}

It is a fundamental factor in road geometry principles and is used by road designers to ensure safe driving conditions. However, designers do not know how a specific ASD may affect the longitudinal and transversal behavior of drivers engaged in negotiating curves. This paper focuses on analyzing driver longitudinal behavior along rural highways curves with limited visibility. A number of virtual sight condition scenarios were recreated and tested in the driving simulator. Three tracks were designed with various combinations of radii and sight obstructions (a continuous wall) along the roadside located at various offsets from the lane centerline, combinations which resulted with a minimum ASD of 56.6 m. Roadside factors capable of influencing the risk perception of drivers (e.g., traffic barriers, posted speed limit signs, vegetation) were all excluded from the simulations. Results indicate that speed and trajectory dispersion from the lane centerline depend linearly on ASD in the investigated range of curve radii (from 120 to 430 m). In general, when ASD increases, so does speed and the trajectories tend to be less dispersed around the lane centerline. As a result, in safety terms, any variation in ASD will have the polar opposite effect on safety related parameters. Furthermore, different curves with similar ASD values resulted in different speed and lateral control behaviors. Analysis from ANOVA support the same findings; in addition, radius, curve direction, and distance from trajectory to sight obstruction have been identified as significant independent parameters. Road designers should adjust the ASD and these parameters when seeking to encourage drivers to adopt appropriate behaviors. To optimize safe driving conditions, ASD should be designed so that it is slightly greater than the required sight distance, since excessive ASD values may encourage drivers to drive at inappropriate speeds.}

However, elderly pedestrians are vulnerable on the streets and are at great risk of injury or death, when involved in a collision. This is due to not only increased frailty but also such issues as reaction speed and confidence on the streets. Therefore, pedestrian safety for older adults is a growing concern. This paper comprehensively examines the relationship between physical conditions and elderly pedestrian safety at the intersection level. By constructing a multinomial logistic regression (MLR) model, this paper identifies the exclusive contributing factors to elderly pedestrian collisions rather than younger pedestrian collisions. The outputs from the model suggest that facilities such as raised median, three-way intersection, street tree, and park and recreational land use improve the safety of elderly pedestrians. They also imply that bus stops increase elderly pedestrian collisions, while the intersections with crosswalks or colored crosswalks do not contribute to elderly pedestrians’ safety, but the safety of younger pedestrians. The findings of this paper provide insight to transportation policies like Complete Street and Vision Zero and help to improve the current road system that are designed for automobiles and young, healthy road users.}

In this context, Road Safety Inspections (RSI) are a proactive tool for identifying safety issues, consisting of a regular, systematic, on-site inspection of existing roads, covering the whole road network, carried out by trained safety expert teams. This paper aims to describe how topic modelling can be effectively used to identify co-occurrence patterns of attributes related to the run-off-road crashes, as well as the corresponding patterns of road safety interventions, as described in the RSI reports. We apply latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a widespread method for fitting a topic model, to analyse the topics mentioned in RSI reports, divided into two groups: problems found; and proposed solutions. For this study, 54 RSI gathered over six years (2012–2017) were analysed, covering 4011 km of Irish roads. The results indicate that important keywords relating to the “forgiving roadside” and “clear zone” concepts, as well as the relevant European technical standards (CEN-EN1317 and EN 12,767), are absent from the extracted latent topics. We also found that the frequency of topics related to roadside safety is higher in the problems record set than in the solutions record set, meaning that problems are more easily identified and related to the roadside area than interventions may be. This paper presents methodological empirical evidence that the LDA is appropriate for identifying the co-occurrence patterns of attributes related to the ROR crashes in road safety inspections’ reports, as well as the interventions’ patterns associated with these crashes. Also, it provides valuable information aimed to determine the extent to which national road authorities in Europe and their contractors are currently capable of implementing and maintaining compliance with roadside standards and guidelines throughout the life cycle of roads.}

abstract = {Global road safety records demonstrate spatial variation of comprehensive cost of traffic crashes across countries. To the best of our knowledge, no study has explored the variation of this matter at a local geographical level. This study proposes a method to estimate the comprehensive crash cost at the zonal level by using person-injury cost. The current metric of road safety attributes safety to the location of the crash, which makes it challenging to assign the crash cost to home-location of the individuals who were involved in traffic crashes. To overcome this limitation, we defined Home-Based Approach crash frequency as the expected number of crashes by severity that road users who live in a certain geographic area have during a specified period. Using crash data from Tennessee, we assign those involved in traffic crashes to the census tract corresponding to their home address. The average Comprehensive Crash Cost at the Zonal Level (CCCAZ) for the period of the study was $18.2 million (2018 dollars). Poisson and Geographically Weighted Poisson Regression (GWPR) models were used to analyzing the data. The GWPR model was more suitable compared to the global model to address spatial heterogeneity. Findings indicate population of people over 60-years-old, the proportion of residents that use non-motorized transportation, household income, population density, household size, and metropolitan indicator have a negative association with CCCAZ. Alternatively, VMT, vehicle per capita, percent educated over 25-year-old, population under 16-year-old, and proportion of non-white races and individuals who use a motorcycle as their commute mode have a positive association with CCCAZ. Findings are discussed in line with road safety literature.}

abstract = {Background
Child pedestrians make up a significant proportion of all road traffic deaths. Our primary objective was to examine the association of driver characteristics with child pedestrian injuries with a secondary objective to broadly describe the road characteristics surrounding these collisions.
Methods
We included drivers involved in child (<18 years old) pedestrian motor-vehicle collisions (PMVCs) in Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta (2010–2015). These drivers were compared with not at fault (Alberta adaptation of a Canadian culpability scoring tool) drivers involved in vehicle-only collisions. The data were analyzed with unconditional logistic regression.
Results
Seven hundred ninety-three drivers collided with 826 children. One quarter of child PMVC drivers were 40–54 years old (25.2%). Younger drivers, 16–24 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.27–2.09), and older drivers, ≥55 (aOR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.24–1.99) were more likely to be involved in a child PMVC. Time of day between 06:01 – 09:00 (aOR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.16–1.85) and 18:01 – 24:00 (aOR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.30–2.17), no seatbelt use (aOR = 2.30, 95% CI: 1.09–4.85), having a child passenger in the vehicle (aOR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.56–2.96), and impairment including ‘had been drinking’ (aOR = 7.70, 95% CI: 2.85–20.86) and ‘fatigued/asleep/medical defect’ (aOR = 27.15, 95% CI: 8.30–88.88) were also associated with being a driver involved in a child PMVC.
Conclusions
Age, time, impairment and distraction were risk factors for being a driver involved in a child PMVC. Because child PMVC driver characteristics differ from the general driver population, driver-based interventions are a rational additional means of preventing child PMVCs.}

In three studies, participants were asked to identify safety-related target(s) in simulated traffic scenes that contained zero, one, or two target(s) of low or high perceptual saliency. These targets were defined as objects or events that would have prevented safe travel in the direction indicated by an arrow preceding the traffic scene. Findings from the pilot study (n = 20) and Experiment 1 (n = 29) demonstrated that detecting one target hindered drivers’ abilities to find a second from the same scene. In Experiment 2 (n = 30), explicit instructions regarding the level of risk were manipulated. It was found that search times were affected by the instructions, though SSMs persisted.

Participants in the Safer Cycling Study in New South Wales, Australia, who reported that they had ridden with children in the last 12 months were questioned about how they ride with children, and their experience of safety issues and crashes. Among the 187 respondents who had ridden with children on their bicycle, the most common form of carrier was a rear-mounted seat (48%) followed by a trailer (29%). Many respondents (79%) identified risks specific to riding carrying children, including those linked with specific carrier types and with use of footpaths. Most (92%) indicated that they change their behaviour when carrying a child on their bicycle; for example, riding more slowly, more carefully, and away from roads. Among crashes with a child on the bicycle, most were falls. Among the 345 participants who had ridden to accompany a child on a bicycle, approximately three quarters identified risks specific to accompanying children, such as managing the child’s limited skill, awareness and predictability. Ninety-seven percent reported behavioural changes including positioning themselves as a barrier for their child and caution crossing roads. Findings suggest strategies to support parents in riding safely with children.}

The approach combines traffic conflicts of different sites and periods and develops a uniform generalized extreme value (GEV) model for the treatment effect estimation. Moreover, a hierarchical Bayesian structure is used to link possible covariates to GEV parameters and to account for unobserved heterogeneity among different sites. The proposed approach was applied to evaluate the safety benefits of a left-turn bay extension project in the City of Surrey, Canada, in which traffic conflicts were collected from 3 treatment sites and 3 matched control sites before and after the treatment. A series of models were developed considering different combinations of covariates and their link to different GEV model parameters. Based on the best fitted model, the treatment effects were analyzed quantitatively using the odds ratio (OR) method as well as qualitatively by comparing the shapes of GEV distributions. The results show that there are significant reduction in the expected number of crashes (i.e., OR = 0.409). In addition, there are apparent changes in the shape of GEV distributions for the treatment sites, where GEV distributions shift further away from the risk of crash area after the treatment. Both of these results indicate significant safety improvements after the left-turn bay extension.}

Instead of applying one single model to the whole dataset or focusing on pre-defined crash types as done in previous studies, the present study proposes a two-step method integrating latent class cluster analysis and random parameters logit model to explore contributing factors influencing the injury levels of motorcyclists. A latent class cluster approach is first used to segment the motorcycle crashes into relatively homogeneous clusters. A mixed logit model is then elaborately developed for each cluster to identify its unique influential factors. The analysis was based on the police-reported crash dataset (2015–2017) of Hunan province, China. The goodness-of-fit indicators and the Receiver Operating Characteristic curves show that the proposed method is more accurate when modeling the riders’ injury severities. The heterogeneity found in each homogeneous subgroup supports the application of the random parameters logit model in the study. More importantly, the results demonstrate that segmenting motorcycle crashes into relatively homogeneous clusters as a preliminary step helps to uncover some important influencing factors hidden in the whole-data model. The proposed method is proved to have great potential for accounting for the source of heterogeneity. The injury risk factors identified in specific cases provide more reliable information for traffic engineers and policymakers to improve motorcycle traffic safety.}

Surrogate measures of safety (SMoS) are being used as a proactive approach to identify severe interactions that do not result in an accident and interpreting them for a safety diagnosis. While most cyclist studies adopting SMoS have evaluated interactions by counting the total number of severe events per location, only a few have focused on the interactions between general directions of movement e.g. through cyclists and right turning vehicles. However, road users perform maneuvers that are more varied at a high spatiotemporal resolution such as a range of sharp to wide turning movements. These maneuvers (motion patterns) have not been considered in past studies as a basis for analysis to identify, among a range of possible motion patterns in each direction of travel, which ones are safer, and which are more likely to result in a crash. This paper presents a novel movement-based probabilistic SMoS approach to evaluate the safety of road users’ trajectories based on clusters of trajectories representing the various movements. This approach is applied to cyclist-vehicle interactions at two locations of cycling network discontinuity and two control sites in Montréal. The Kruskal-Wallis and Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests are used to compare the time-to-collision (TTC) distribution between motion patterns in each site and between sites with and without a discontinuity. Results demonstrate the insight provided by the new approach and indicate that cyclist interactions are more severe and less safe at locations with a cycling network discontinuity and that cyclists following different movements have statistically different levels of safety.}

Vehicles with full longitudinal and latitudinal control will allow drivers to engage in secondary tasks without monitoring the roadway, but users may be required to resume vehicle control to handle critical hazards. The loss of driver’s situational awareness increases the potential for accidents. Thus, the automated systems need to estimate the driver’s ability to resume control of the driving task. The aim of this study was to assess the physiological behaviour (heart rate and pupil diameter) of drivers. The assessment was performed during two naturalistic secondary tasks. The tasks were the email and the twenty questions task in addition to a control group that did not perform any tasks. The study aimed at finding possible correlations between the driver’s physiological data and their responses to a takeover request. A driving simulator study was used to collect data from a total of 33 participants in a repeated measures design to examine the physiological changes during driving and to measure their takeover quality and response time. Secondary tasks induced changes on physiological measures and a small influence on response time. However, there was a strong observed correlation between the physiological measures and response time. Takeover quality in this study was assessed using two new performance measures called PerSpeed and PerAngle. They are identified as the mean percentage change of vehicle’s speed and heading angle starting from a take-over request time. Using linear mixed models, there was a strong interaction between task, heart rate and pupil diameter and PerSpeed, PerAngle and response time. This, in turn, provided a measurable understanding of a driver’s future responses to the automated system based on the driver’s physiological changes to allow better decision making. The present findings of this study emphasised the possibility of building a driver mental state model and prediction system to determine the quality of the driver's responses in a highly automated vehicle. Such results will reduce accidents and enhance the driver’s experience in highly automated vehicles.}

In order to evaluate key risk factors in motorcycle crashes, this study quantifies how different “policy-sensitive” factors correlate with injury severity, while controlling for rider and crash specific factors as well as other observed/unobserved factors. The study analyzes data from 321 motorcycle injury crashes from a comprehensive US DOT FHWA’s Motorcycle Crash Causation Study (MCCS). These were all non-fatal injury crashes that are representative of the vast majority (82%) of motorcycle crashes. An anatomical injury severity scoring system, termed as Injury Severity Score (ISS), is analyzed providing an overall score by accounting for the possibility of multiple injuries to different body parts of a rider. An ISS ranges from 1 to 75, averaging at 10.32 for this sample (above 9 is considered serious injury), with a spike at 1 (very minor injury). Preliminary cross-tabulation analysis mapped ISS to the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) injury classification and examined the strength of associations between the two. While the study finds a strong correlation between AIS and ISS classification (Kendall’s tau of 0.911), significant contrasts are observed in that, when compared to ISS, AIS tends to underestimate the severity of an injury sustained by a rider. For modeling, fixed and random parameter Tobit modeling frameworks were used in a corner-solution setting to account for the left-tail spike in the distribution of ISS and to account for unobserved heterogeneity. The developed random parameters Tobit framework additionally accounts for the interactive effects of key risk factors, allowing for possible correlations among random parameters. A correlated random parameter Tobit model significantly out-performed the uncorrelated random parameter Tobit and fixed parameter Tobit models. While controlling for various other factors, we found that motorcycle-specific shoes and retroreflective upper body clothing correlate with lower ISS on-average by 5.94 and 1.88 units respectively. Riders with only partial helmet coverage on-average sustained more severe injuries, whereas, riders with acceptable helmet fit had lower ISS Methodologically, not only do the individual effects of several key risk factors vary significantly across observations in the form of random parameters, but the interactions between unobserved factors characterizing random parameters significantly influence the injury severity score as well. The implications of the findings are discussed.}

Due to underreporting, collision data generally provide a very low (highly biased) estimate of actual AVC counts and often lack key details, such as the species of animals involved. However, AVC reports cover entire states and nations, and can illuminate differences in wild versus domestic animal-vehicle collisions through statistical and spatial analysis. 51,522 animal-related crashes were reported to Texas police from 2010 through 2016, at a total cost over $1.3 billion annually to Texas motorists – not including the value of lost animal lives. AVC reports jump twice a day: between 5 and 8 AM and between 5 and 10 PM. Motorists are also significantly more likely to collide with a wild animal during the months of October, November, and December. Wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC) are 64% of total reports, events involving domestic animals (like dogs and cattle) are 31%, and the remaining 5% of reports are unspecified. Most AVCs in the state occur at night in unlit locations, usually on rural roads with very low traffic volumes. Using ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression analysis across Texas’ n = 254 counties, this work finds that less densely populated counties, marked as rural, and those with fewer vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) per capita but more lane-miles per capita, tend to experience the greatest number of AVCs per VMT, after controlling for county average rainfall, share of VMT onsystem roadways, job densities, and vehicle ownership (vehicles per capita). Intervention options for the mitigation of animal-vehicle collisions are numerous and diverse. For wildlife collisions specifically, this work finds that large crossing structures (underpasses and overpasses) at the highway link level return benefit-to-cost ratios near 3.0, while their lower-cost counterparts (wildlife fencing and animal detection systems) deliver ratios up to 30.}

Modelling results suggest that pedestrians tended to compensate for the risks of illegal crossing by forming group and avoiding digital and social distractions (i.e., calling, operating a mobile phone’s screen, listening to music, or talking to other pedestrians while crossing). In addition, overpass usage decreased with taller overpasses, but increased with wider overpasses. Effects of gender, weather, and illegal crossing speed on overpass use were also discussed.}

abstract = {Objective
A remarkable portion of children’s traffic-related deaths occurred when travelling in as passengers in vehicles, but so far, few studies have focused on crash characteristics and crash risks of drivers with child passengers. It has been assumed that drivers with child passengers drive responsibly, but on the contrary, children in vehicles can distract drivers, increasing crash risks. In this study, we examined fatal crash characteristics and fatal crash risks of drivers with child passengers.
Methods
Fatal crash data from the U.S. Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) for 1996–2015 were used. Only passenger-vehicle drivers aged 23–46 years old were included in the analysis because they represent the typical age of drivers with 0–9-year-old child passengers in the database. Prevalence of crash characteristics and the odds of being at fault were examined for drivers with only child passengers and compared to drivers with only adult passengers, with no passengers and with both adult and child passengers. Analyses were done separately for intersection crashes and non-junction crashes.
Results
Female drivers were involved in twice as many fatal crashes alone with child passengers compared to male drivers. Drivers with only child passengers were more often reported as being inattentive, but for them, risk-taking behaviours were less typical than for drivers without child passengers. Our results showed that these differences were more evident in non-junction crashes than in intersection crashes. When risk-taking behaviours were controlled, both male and female drivers with only child passengers had higher odds of being at fault than drivers with adult passengers (with or without children) in non-junction crashes, but these differences were not significant in intersection crashes.
Conclusions
Drivers with child passengers represent a specific driver population. They have a higher tendency to engage in distractions while driving, but they have fewer risk-taking behaviour-related fatal crashes compared to drivers with no child passengers. Our results indicate that the effects of child-passenger-related distractions on fatal crash risks are more relevant outside intersections, presumably because drivers may try to self-regulate their interactions with child passengers and focus on driving in more demanding traffic situations.}

abstract = {Maintaining taxi safety is one of the important goals of operating urban transportation systems. Taxicabs are often prone to higher crash risk due to their long-time exposure to the complicated and dynamic traffic environments in urban areas. Despite existing efforts in understanding the safety issues associated with these vehicles, there were still few attempts that have specifically examined the relationship between taxi-involved crashes and other multifaceted contributing factors. To this end, this paper aims to develop crash frequency models for analyzing taxi-involved crashes. In particular, the spatial autocorrelations between variables were explored and the Poisson conditional autoregressive (Poisson-CAR) models for taxi-involved crashes were proposed. Unlike previous safety studies that mainly consider distance as the key indicator of spatial correlation, the present paper introduced the use of massive taxi trip data for constructing a more informative spatial weight matrix. The developed models with the taxi trip-based weight matrix were tested by using the 2016 taxi trip data collected in Washington D.C. The modeling results highlight the key explanatory factors such as road density, taxi activity, number of bus stops, and land use. More importantly, it demonstrates that the proposed Poisson-CAR models with the taxi trip-based weight matrix outperformed both the non-spatial Poisson model and the Poisson-CAR models using conventional distance-based weight matrix. Moran’s I tests further indicate that our proposed models have sufficiently accounted for the spatial autocorrelation of the residuals. Thus, it deserves to consider informative spatial weight matrices when applying spatial models in traffic safety studies.}

These schemes have the potential to better identify risky drivers which not only allows insurance companies to better price their products but it allows drivers to modify their behaviour to make roads safer and driving more efficient. However, for Usage-based insurance products, we need to better understand how driver behaviours influence the risk of a crash or an insurance claim. In this article, we present our analysis of automotive telematics data from over 28 million trips. We use a case control methodology to study the relationship between crash drivers and crash-free drivers and introduce an innovative method for determining control (crash-free) drivers. We fit a logistic regression model to our data and found that speeding was the most important driver behaviour linking driver behaviour to crash risk.}

In the existing literature, it was found that truck-involved crashes are affected by factors such as road geometry, weather, driver and vehicle characteristics, and traffic volume based on a variety of statistical methodologies; however, the endogenous impact resulting from driver traffic violation has not been considered. The goal of the study is to discover the factors influencing freight vehicle crashes and develop more accurate crash probability estimation by explaining the endogenous driver traffic violations. To achieve the purpose of this study, we applied the two-stage residual inclusion (2SRI) approach, a methodology used in the nonlinear regression analysis model for capturing the endogeneity issue. This method improves the accuracy of the model by capturing the unobserved effects of driver traffic violations. From the results, traffic violations were identified to be influenced by the driver’s physical condition, as well as driver and vehicle characteristics. Furthermore, variables of driver traffic violations such as improper passing, speeding, and safe distance violation were found to be endogenous in the probability model of freight truck crashes on expressway mainlines.}

Previous studies have found associations between cyclist-vehicle crashes and vehicle and bike exposures, network configuration, land use, road facility, and the built environment. In addition, the network configuration, land use, and road facility were found to affect bike exposure levels. The association of zonal characteristics with both exposure and crashes may bias the development of macro-level bike safety models. This paper aims to explain these associations simultaneously using a form of Structural Equation Modelling approach. The analysis assesses the mediated effects that some variables have on crashes through their effects on bike exposure (by setting bike exposure as a mediator). Data from 134 traffic analysis zones (TAZ’s) in the City of Vancouver, Canada is used as a case study. The indirect effect of network configuration, land use, and road facility on cyclist-vehicle crashes was assessed through Bayesian mediation analysis. Mediation analysis is an approach used to estimate how one variable transmits its effects to another variable through a certain mediator. These effects could be direct only, indirect only (through a certain mediator), or both direct and indirect. The results showed that the bike kilometers travelled (BKT) was a mediator of the relationship between network configuration, land use, and road facility and cyclist-vehicle crashes. The mediation analysis showed that some variables have different direct and indirect effect on cyclist-vehicle crashes. This indicates that while some variables may have negative direct association with crashes, their total crash effect can be positive after accounting for their effect through exposure. For example, bike network coverage and recreational density have negative direct association with cyclist-vehicle crashes, and positive indirect association leading to positive total effect on cyclist-vehicle crashes.}

As automated vehicles improve in capability and increase in market share these conditions will change, possibly reducing the accuracy of HSM predictions. Assessing the transferability of a crash modification factor to new situations almost certainly requires an explanation of how the modification achieves its effect, but at present there is little guidance on how such explanations might be posed and tested. This paper describes the use of micro-simulation to develop an explanation of how pedestrian hybrid beacons (PHB) modify pedestrian crash likelihood. Since the literature indicated that PHBs can affect both pedestrian and driver behavior it was necessary to include both possibilities in the model. To simulate injury severity distributions similar to those recorded in a crash database it was necessary to propose that almost all simulated drivers attempt to brake in pedestrian/vehicle encounters. Then changing the simulated fraction of careful pedestrians from between 0% and 30% to between 80% and 90% gave simulated crash modification factors similar to estimates reported in the literature. The resulting working hypothesis then is that PHBs achieve their crash reduction effect in large part by modifying pedestrian behavior. This is not so much a direct observation as it is an inference to the best explanation. That is, the support for the hypothesis comes from its ability to explain the data at hand. This hypothesis should be tested further, and additional tests are proposed.}

To investigate the effectiveness of PPS on reducing illegal driving behavior, this study analyzed traffic violation data of a Chinese city in 2017. This analysis revealed that 1) risky driving behaviors (RDBs) are among the main causes of traffic violations and 2) almost half of the offenders with multiple violations committed the same traffic rule violations more than once. To further explain these phenomena, a survey in another Chinese city–Tianjin–was conducted. Considering the fact that most types of RDBs will, if detected by the authorities, result in traffic violations, the present study investigated the influence of a PPS, represented by penalty experience (PE), on traffic violation behaviors from the perspective of RDBs. Moreover, the impact of cognitive processes on driving behaviors via self-efficacy was considered. We found that drivers’ PE is positively associated with their RDBs and that offenders with more PE are more inclined to commit RDBs; we further observed that self-efficacy partially mediates the relationship between PE and RDBs. However, no gender difference in the effect of PE on RDBs was discovered, thus indicating that PE has the same effect on male and female drivers. Based on these findings, some strategies are suggested (such as the Increasing Block Penalty Points Policy) to improve the effectiveness of the PPS.}

The aim of this study was to examine associations between driving under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol and driver-related risk factors that have been reported as significantly contributing causes of fatal road traffic crashes. The data were extracted from Norwegian road traffic crash registries and forensic toxicology databases. Drug/alcohol investigated car and van drivers and motorcycle riders fatally injured in road traffic crashes in Norway during 2005–2015 were included in this study (n = 772). Drug and alcohol concentrations corresponding to 0.5 g/kg alcohol in blood were used as the lower limits for categorising drivers/riders as impaired; 0.2 g/kg was the upper limit for being categorised as sober. Associations between driver-related risk factors and impairment from specific substance groups were calculated using multivariable logistic regression, adjusted for other substance groups, age, and sex, and were reported when the confidence intervals did not contain the value 1 or lower. Substances found in concentrations above the impairment limits were mainly alcohol (20%), medicinal drugs (10%: benzodiazepines, opioids, z-hypnotics), stimulants (5%: amphetamines, methylphenidate, and cocaine), and cannabis (4%: THC). The drug/alcohol-impaired drivers had compared to the sober drivers more often been speeding (68% versus 32%), not used a seatbelt (69% versus 30%), and been driving without a valid driver license (26% versus 1%). Logistic regression analysis showed that impairment from alcohol or stimulants (mainly amphetamines) was associated with all three risk factors, medicinal drugs with all except speeding, and impairment from cannabis (THC) with not having a valid driver license. Among motorcycle riders, drug/alcohol impairment was associated with not having a valid driver license and non-use of a helmet. At least one of the risk factors speeding, non-use of a seatbelt/helmet, and driving without a valid license were present among the vast majority of the drug/alcohol-impaired fatally injured drivers and riders, and also among more than half of the fatally injured sober drivers.}

The regression parameter estimation could suffer from the finite sample bias when event frequency is low, which is commonly observed in safety research as crashes are rare events. In this study, we apply a bias-correction procedure to the parameter estimation of Poisson and NB regression models. We provide a general bias-correction formulation and illustrate the finite sample bias through a special scenario with a single binary explanatory variable. Several factors affecting the magnitude of bias are identified, including the number of crashes and the balance of the crash counts within strata of a categorical explanatory variable. Simulations are conducted to examine the properties of the bias-corrected coefficient estimators. The results show that the bias-corrected estimators generally provide less bias and smaller variance. The effect is especially pronounced when the crash count in one stratum is between 5 and 50. We apply the proposed method to a case study of infrastructure safety evaluation. Three scenarios were evaluated, all crashes collected in three years, and two hypothetical situations, where crash information was collected for “half-year” and “quarter-year” periods. The case-study results confirm that the magnitude of bias correction is larger for smaller crash counts. This paper demonstrates the finite sample bias associated with the small number of crashes and suggests bias adjustment can provide more accurate estimation when evaluating the impacts of crash risk factors.}

Learner drivers (n = 544), aged 16–19 years, responded to a 91-item survey. Self-regulated safety orientation was found to fully mediate the relationship between higher-order driving instruction and inattentive risky driving behaviours, and between anticipatory higher-order driving instruction and intentional risky driving behaviours. A partial mediation was found between self-regulatory higher-order instruction and intentional risky driving behaviours. These results support that higher-order driving instruction, delivered to develop a self-regulated safety orientation, has potential to reduce young novice drivers’ risky driving behaviours. Further research is recommended to triangulate these results through direct observation and longitudinal evaluation.}

The sample consisted of 3423 respondents across the six countries. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess the fit of the data to the five-factor structure, and a four-factor structure in which violations and errors were combined into one factor (seen elsewhere in the literature). For some items, factor loadings were unacceptably low, internal reliability was low for two of the sub-scales, and model fit indices were generally unacceptable for both models. As such, only the violations, lapses, and aggressions sub-scales were retained (those with acceptable reliability and factor loadings), and the three-factor model tested. Although results suggest that the violations sub-scale may need additional attention, the three-factor solution showed the best fit to the data. The resulting 12-item scale is discussed with regards to country differences, and with respect to its utility as a research tool in cross-cultural studies of road user behaviour.}

On-road fatalities are an unfortunate loss of life and lead to significant costs for society and the economy. Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), envisaged as operating with idealised safety and cooperation, could be a means of mitigating these costs. This paper intends to provide insights into the safety improvements to be attained by incrementally transitioning the fleet to CAVs. This investigation is done by constructing a calibrated microsimulation environment in Vissim and deploying the custom developed Virdi CAV Control Protocol (VCCP) algorithm for CAV behaviour. The CAV behaviour is implemented using an application programming interface and a dynamic linking library. CAVs are introduced to the environment in 10% increments, and safety performance is assessed using the Surrogate Safety Assessment Module (SSAM). The results of this study show that CAVs at low penetrations result in an increase in conflicts at signalised intersections but a decrease at priority-controlled intersections. The initial 20% penetration of CAVs is accompanied by a +22%, −87%, −62% and +33% change in conflicts at the signalised, priority, roundabout and DDI intersection respectively. CAVs at high penetrations indicate a global reduction in conflicts. A 90% CAV penetration is accompanied by a −48%, −100%, −98% and −81% change in conflicts at the signalised, priority, roundabout and DDI intersection respectively.}

The method leverages the space- and time-referenced crash data and powerful computational tools. This study performed non-stationarity tests to verify whether the local correlates of pedestrian injury severity have a significant spatio-temporal variation. Results showed that some variables passed the tests, indicating they have a significantly varying spatio-temporal relationship with the pedestrian injury severity. These factors include the pedestrian age, pedestrian position, crash location, motorist age and gender, driving under the influence (DUI), motor vehicle type and crash time in a day. The spatio-temporally varying correlates of pedestrian injury severity are valuable for researchers and practitioners to localize pedestrian safety improvement solutions in North Carolina. For example, in near future, special attention may be paid to DUI crashes in the city of Charlotte and Asheville, because in such areas DUI-involved crashes are even more likely to cause severe pedestrian injuries that in other areas.

This study aims to address these gaps by proposing a generic methodology for safety evaluation applicable also in non-lane-based multi-class traffic conditions. It utilizes precise position of the vehicles and their widths to identify critical interactions between all types of vehicles. Conflicts are then estimated from these critical interactions using the modified time-to-collision (MTTC), an existing SMoS. The proposed methodology is evaluated in both lane-based as well as non-lane based traffic conditions. The former uses NGSIM trajectory data and compares the estimated conflicts with the literature. The latter, on the other hand, uses simulated vehicle trajectories from an expressway but compares the estimated conflicts with historical crash data. The results show that estimated conflicts exhibit significant temporal and spatial correlation with real crashes. It also shows the suitability of the methodology for diverse traffic conditions.}

The LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) analysis identified six disability items (from the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2) to predict poor physical and one item to predict poor mental health-related quality of life. Logistic regressions of these items in addition to age and gender were used to develop a screening tool. Using the tool, 90% of those at risk of poor physical and 80% of those at risk of poor mental health-related quality of life were identified correctly. To conclude, this study presents an 8-item, context-specific tool to help injury managers identify individuals at risk of poor physical and mental health recovery following mild-moderate RTC-related injuries.

This approach neglects the time-varying nature of critical factors such as traffic speed, volume, and density, and their effects on traffic safety. This paper evaluated the relationship between crashes and quality of flow at different levels of temporal aggregation using continuous count station data and probe data from 4 lane rural freeway and 6 lane urban freeway segments in Virginia. The performance of crash prediction models using traffic and geometric information at 15-minute, hourly, and annual aggregation intervals were contrasted. This study also assessed whether inclusion of speed data improved model performance and examined the effects of using speeds from physical sensors versus speed estimates from private-sector probe speed data. The results showed that using average hourly volume along with average speed and selected geometric variables improved predictions compared to annual models that did not use speed information. When comparing an AADT-based model to an average hourly volume model for total crashes, the mean absolute prediction error improved by 11% for rural models and 20% for urban models. This result was based on volume and speed data from continuous count stations. When private sector probe speed data was used, the rural model performance improved by 10% and urban models by 20%. This trend was consistent for all crash types irrespective of level of injury or number of vehicles involved. Even though models using private sector data performed slightly worse than the ones based on continuous count data, they were still far better than AADT based models. These results indicate that probe based data can be used in developing crash models without harming prediction capability.}

abstract = {Car-following is a common driving behavior which has a significant effect on driver safety and comfort. Although a large number of studies have focused on car-following models for autonomous vehicles (AV) and connected vehicles (CV), car-following models for AV and CV which consider cut-ins in mixed traffic have not been investigated. In this study, a human-like car-following model for AV and CV was developed by examining the effect of cut-in vehicles on car-following behavior and the expectations of drivers. The cut-in position, reaction time, acceleration, and desired distance were investigated on a real freeway in an instrumented vehicle. Corresponding to results from previous studies, the cut-in vehicles maintain a safe distance from the preceding vehicle and a larger distance from the following vehicle to avoid conflict. Analysis of the behavior of the following driver illustrates that in the keeping stages, the reaction time after the cut-in is 0.85 s for the acceleration stimulus and 0.70 s for the deceleration stimulus. These times are shorter than the response time before the cut-in for the acceleration (1.95 s) and deceleration stimuli (1.66 s). The acceleration, rate of increase in the acceleration with the relative speed, and the desired distance are lower after than before the cut-in events. In this paper, a human-like car-following model for cut-in situations is proposed, which is designed for autonomous vehicles. Unlike previous car-following models, the proposed model has a shorter response time and lower deceleration in cut-in situations. The proposed model may help to improve car-following safety, driver comfort, and trust in AVs and CVs.}

abstract = {Count regression models have been applied widely in traffic safety research to estimate expected crash frequencies on road segments. Data mining algorithms, such as classification and regression trees, have recently been introduced into the field to overcome some of the assumptions associated with statistical models. However, these data-driven algorithms usually provide non-parametric output, making it difficult to draw statistical inference or to evaluate how independent variables are associated with expected crash frequencies. In this paper, the model-based recursive partitioning (MOB) algorithm is applied in a crash frequency application. The algorithm incorporates the concept of recursive partitioning data in tree models and develops user-defined statistical models as outputs. The objective of this paper is to explore the potential of the MOB algorithm as a methodological alternative to parametric modeling methods in crash frequency analysis. To accomplish the objective, a standard negative binomial (NB) regression model, a NB model developed using the MOB algorithm, adjusted NB models which incorporate variables identified by the MOB algorithm, and a random parameters NB model are compared using 8 years of data collected from two-lane rural highways in Pennsylvania. The models are compared in terms of data fitness, sign and magnitude of statistical association between the independent and dependent variables, and predictive power. The results show that the MOB-NB model yields better data fitness than other NB models, and provides similar performance to the RPNB model, suggesting that the MOB-NB model may be capturing unobserved heterogeneity by dividing the data into subgroups. The presence of a passing zone and posted speed limit are two covariates identified by the MOB algorithm that differentiate variable effects among subgroups. In addition, the MOB-NB model provides the highest prediction accuracy based on the training and test data sets, although the difference among models is small. The comparison results reveal that the MOB algorithm is a promising alternative to identify covariates, evaluate variable associations and instability, and make predictions in a crash frequency context.}

abstract = {Traffic safety analysis at the macroscopic level usually relies on previously defined areal traffic analysis zones (TAZs) that are used as the units of investigation. Hence, statistical inference is made on the basis of such units, implying that the consideration of a certain TAZ configuration may influence the results and conclusions achieved. Regarding this, the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) is a well-known issue in the field of spatial statistics, which refers to the effects that arise in statistical properties and estimations when there is a change in areal units of analysis. In this paper, the consequences of MAUP have been investigated through a dataset of traffic crashes that occurred in Valencia within the years 2014 and 2015 and two common statistical models: a conditional autoregressive model and a geographically weighted regression. In the absence of an established TAZ scheme for the city, four classes of basic spatial units (BSUs) were considered: census tracts, hexagonal units and two types with construction based on the structure of main roads and intersections of the city. Each of these BSU types was specified at different levels of spatial aggregation. The main research objective was to investigate the final effects that changes in BSU type and scale have on model parameter estimations, but also the specific alterations that MAUP causes to data in terms of the distributional characteristics of the response, multicollinearity among the covariates and covariates’ spatial autocorrelation. The results showed the presence and severity of MAUP for the dataset and area that were analysed. Although effects from scale variations were more moderate, changing the BSU type affected the results severely. The joint use of hexagonal units and a conditional autoregressive model achieved the best performance among all the possibilities explored, but the choice of a proper BSU unit should rely on more factors. Despite MAUP effects, educational centres showed a consistent (and negative) association with traffic crashes, a fact possibly related to their distribution across the whole city. Other covariates revealed a positive correlation with crash counts, but these findings were more uncertain given the discrepancies found at different scales and zonings.}

Thus, it is of interest to know which parts of a road structure present an overrepresentation of a specific type of traffic accident, specially for some typologies of collisions and vehicles that tend to trigger more severe consequences for the users being involved. In this study, a spatial approach is followed to estimate the risk that different types of collisions and vehicles present in the central area of Valencia (Spain), considering the accidents observed in this city during the period 2014–2017. A directed spatial linear network representing the non-pedestrian road structure of the area of interest was employed to guarantee an accurate analysis of the point pattern. A kernel density estimation technique was used to approximate the probability of risk along the network for each collision and vehicle type. A procedure based on these estimates and the sample size locally available within the network was designed and tested to determine a set of differential risk hotspots for each typology of accident considered. A Monte Carlo based simulation process was then defined to assess the statistical significance of each of the differential risk hotspots found, allowing the elaboration of rankings of importance and the possible rejection of the least significant ones.}

In this study, we tested if hard braking events might be accounted for by drivers' hazard perception (HP) ability. Our investigation was based on an original approach. Usually, researchers define hard braking according to a single deceleration threshold (e.g., g<-0.5). In this study, we chose different thresholds for hard braking (−0.25 to −0.6 g) and for each threshold, we examined the linkage between HP test (HPT) scores and the proportion of hard braking events. We hypothesized that this linkage would be stronger if the threshold that defines hard braking is higher. This is because the stronger the braking events, the higher the likelihood that they resulted from later detection of hazards and the lower the likelihood that they resulted from other causes (e.g., road humps). Thirty-three drivers completed an HPT and used a smartphone app that recorded their vehicle kinematics. We estimated the coefficient of HPT score in a series of binomial regression models on the proportion of hard braking events. In accordance with our hypothesis, we found that the coefficient of HPT score changed as a function of the threshold for hard braking. This finding was based on a significant negative Spearman correlation between the coefficients and the threshold and on linear functions that we derived from two binomial models that allowed the coefficient of HPT to vary according to the threshold. Our findings show that hard braking events are related to HP ability and can inform safety interventions in response to excessive proportion of hard braking events. In addition, they demonstrate that using a range of thresholds for hard braking is a practical tool in the study of hard braking events. From a theoretical perspective, our findings provide strong support to hazard perception theory.}

Such processing has typically been measured by recording drivers’ patterns of eye movements, however, the exact ways in which eye movements are reported and interpreted varies substantially between different studies in the literature. Therefore, the objective of this systematic review was to investigate whether novice drivers and experienced drivers do differ in clear and reproducible ways in their visual search. Studies were identified through searches of Web of Science, Medline, TRID Database, and the TRB Research in Progress Database, with no restrictions on publication status. Studies were included if they compared the visual search of a novice driver group (<3 years driving experience) and an experienced driver group (>3 years driving experience) using an eye tracking method and reported at least one of the following four visual search outcomes: fixation durations, horizontal spread of search, vertical spread of search and number of fixations. Two reviewers independently screened searches and assessed the full texts of potentially included studies. Of the 235 studies initially identified 18 were included in the review, with 13 studies reporting sufficient data to be included in the meta-analysis for at least one outcome measure. Given that the included studies deployed a range of method types, additional sub-group analyses were conducted using this factor. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted by temporarily removing extreme experience groups (e.g. driving instructors and learner drivers) in order to test the effect of different levels of experience and training. The meta-analyses, along with support from results discussed narratively, revealed that novice drivers have a narrower horizontal spread of search compared to experienced drivers, however, there were no overall differences in fixation durations, vertical spread of search or number of fixations when the studies were pooled together. These findings have important primary implications for the development of novice training interventions, with novice drivers needing to develop a broader horizontal spread of visual search, but not to necessarily learn to fixate further down the road. Subgroup analyses also provided considerations for future research studies in terms of the experience of the driver groups, and the method type used.}

Further explore the utility of protection motivation theory (PMT) in developing effective roadside anti-speeding messages.
Method
Via an electronic link, 81 participants holding a current Australian driver’s license rated all possible pairs of 18 PMT-derived anti-speeding messages in terms of their perceived effectiveness in reducing speed for themselves, and for drivers in general.
Results
While some messages revealed third-person effects (perceived as being more relevant to drivers-in-general than to self-as-driver), others showed reverse third-person effects (perceived as being more relevant to self-as-driver than to drivers-in-general). Compared with messages based on coping appraisal components, those derived from threat appraisal PMT components (perceived severity, counter-rewards, vulnerability) were rated as being more effective, both for participants themselves as driver, and for drivers-in-general. Compared with females, males reported threat appraisal messages as being more effective for reducing speed in themselves (reverse third-person effect). Aggregate scores for the 18 messages derived from this ipsative methodology correlated modestly with those from a normative study using similarly-worded items.
Discussion
As jurisdictions globally recognize speeding as a major road safety issue, effective anti-speeding campaigns are essential. Findings added to current knowledge of PMT’s efficacy as a basis for generating effective anti-speeding messages and indicated areas for future research and application.}

Understanding the causes that give rise to different types of conflict events, as well as their characteristics, can help researchers and traffic authorities to draw up strategies aimed at mitigating collision risks. This paper proposes a framework for grouping traffic conflicts relying on similar profiles and factors that contribute to conflict occurrence using self-organizing maps (SOM). In order to improve the quality of the formed groups, we developed a novel variable importance index relying on the outputs of the nonlinear principal component analysis (NLPCA) that intends to identify the most informative variables for grouping collision events. Such index guides a backward variable selection procedure in which less relevant variables are removed one-by-one; after each removal, the clustering quality is assessed via the Davies-Bouldin (DB) index. The proposed framework was applied to a real-time dataset collected from a Brazilian highway aimed at allocating traffic conflicts into groups presenting similar profiles. The selected variables suggest that lower average speeds, which are typically verified during congestion events, contribute to conflict occurrence. Higher variability on speed (denoted by high standard deviation, and speed’s coefficient of variation levels on that variable), which are also perceived in the assessed freeway near to congestion periods, also contribute to conflicts.}

This article presents the underpinning of revising the Dutch design manual for motorways for turbulence in traffic. For this study loop detector data at eight on-ramps and five off-ramps were collected as well as empirical trajectory data at fourteen different on-ramps (three), off-ramps (three) and weaving segments (eight) in The Netherlands. The results show that the areas around ramps that are influenced by turbulence are smaller than described in the design manuals and that, in their present form, the microscopic simulation software packages VISSIM and MOTUS fail to simulate the number and location of lane-changes around ramps realistically.}

Past-year users were four times as likely to report having driven when they may have been over the legal blood-alcohol limit (adjusted OR [aOR] = 4.18; 95% CI: 2.11, 8.25) but were not more likely to report having had a crash or citation (aOR = 1.36; 95% CI: 0.70, 2.66) in the past year.

Therefore, the present study aims to explore the influence of roadwork characteristics and drivers’ individual differences in terms of personality traits and self-assessment of driving skills on speed preferences in a rural work zone. Eight hundred forty-five Norwegian drivers stated their preferred speed for ten pictures of a rural work zone with a 50 km/h reduced speed limit without knowing the speed limit. The results showed that the preferred speeds were greater than the actual reduced speed limit for all pictures. The standard deviations were quite high (from 11 to 14 km/h), indicating that drivers have a rather high variation in preferred speeds. A multilevel model was used to analyse the effects of the variables on speed preference. The results indicated that preferred speeds increased with age, higher scores on the normlessness scale, and higher self-assessment of own driving skills. As for the roadwork characteristics, speed increased with the presence of road markings by 11 km/h, while it decreased by 9 km/h with the presence of road delineators and by 5 km/h with barriers. Implications for respect for the reduced speed limits in work zones were discussed, and recommendations of other countermeasures were presented.}

Crash data, roadway geometric design features, and traffic characteristics were collected along the two directions of a 45-km freeway section in Shanghai, China. Univariate negative binomial conditional autoregressive (NB-CAR) and bivariate negative binomial spatial conditional autoregressive (BNB-CAR) models were developed to analyze the influencing factors and specifically address (1) site correlation between SV and MV crashes within the same freeway segment, and (2) spatial correlation among different freeway segments within the same direction. The modeling results showed substantial differences in the significant factors that influence SV and MV crashes, including both roadway geometric features and traffic operational factors. A non-negligible site correlation was found between SV and MV crashes. Taking into account the site correlation, the BNB-CAR model outperformed the NB-CAR model in terms of parameter estimation and model fitting. For hotspot identification, potential for safety improvement based on the empirical Bayes method was adopted to handle the crash fluctuation problem. Substantial inconsistency was found between SV and MV hotspots despite the site correlation: in the top ten hotspots, no hotspot was shared by the two crash types. This result highlights the importance of differentiating SV and MV crashes when identifying hotspots, providing insight into freeway safety analysis.}

Results indicated that passenger presence interacted with driver distraction to have an effect on elevated g-force events in curves. Separately, distraction affected driving performance differently according to whether the task was visual, cognitive or combined.

Although police-reported crash data provides information on crashes, this study takes advantage of the SHRP2 Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) which is a unique dataset that allows new insights due to detailed information on driver behavior in normal, pre-crash, and near-crash situations, in addition to trip and vehicle performance characteristics. This paper investigates the role of pre-crash driving instability, or driving volatility, in crash intensity (measured on a 4-point scale from a tire-strike to an injury crash) by analyzing microscopic vehicle kinematic data. NDS data are used to investigate not only the vehicle movements in space but also the instability of vehicles prior to the crash and their contribution to crash intensity using path analysis. A subset of the data containing 617 crash events with around 0.18 million temporal trajectories are analyzed. To quantify driving instability, microscopic variations or volatility in vehicular movements before a crash are analyzed. Specifically, nine measures of pre-crash driving volatility are calculated and used to explain crash intensity. While most of the measures are significantly correlated with crash intensity, substantial positive correlations are observed for two measures representing speed and deceleration volatilities. Modeling results of the fixed and random parameter probit models revealed that volatility is one of the leading factors increasing the probability of a severe crash. Additionally, the speed prior to a crash is highly correlated with intensity outcomes, as expected. Interestingly, distracted and aggressive driving are highly correlated with driving volatility and have substantial indirect effects on crash intensity. With volatile driving serving as a leading indicator of crash intensity, given the crashes analyzed in this study, early warnings and alerts for the subject vehicle driver and proximate vehicles can be helpful when volatile behavior is observed.}

abstract = {Background
Rollover crashes of buses occur less frequently than do those involving passenger cars; however, they are associated with higher fatality rates. During rollover crashes, a vehicle experiences multidirectional acceleration and multiple impacts, yielding a complex interaction between structural components and its occupants. A better understanding of vehicle and occupant’s motion, structural deformation, and vehicle and road interactions are necessary to improve the safety of the occupants during this event. One of the key factors in rollover crashworthiness assessment is to investigate the relationship between the strength of the vehicle’s structure and the risk of injury outcomes. However, rollover crashes involving buses have received less research attention than have those involving passenger cars. Experimental studies in bus rollover safety have mainly focused on the structural integrity of the passenger compartment without considering the occupant responses. The main goal of this research is to evaluate the rollover mechanism and associated injury risk during two experimental rollover tests for a paratransit cutaway bus that is commonly used by transit agencies.
Methods
The modified dolly rollover (MDR) and tilt table (TT) tests were conducted using a similar bus and anthropomorphic test device (ATD) configurations. In each test, a 2-point and 3-point belted Hybrid III 50th percent male ATDs were used to quantify the kinematics of the occupants. The deformation index (DI), accelerations and angular velocities of the bus’s CG were measured as vehicle responses. The collected data were then calibrated and filtered to assess the effects of the test procedure on kinematic responses of the vehicle and occupants. Next, the effectiveness of the 2-point vs 3-point seatbelt to reduce or prevent the injuries, the vulnerable body regions and corresponded injury risk were evaluated.
Results
The residual space remained intact (DI < 1) during both rollover tests, however, the ATD responses were quite different. The results of the injury assessment indicate that the risk of the injuries in the MDR test was significantly higher than the TT test. The highest risk of injuries was identified for the head, neck, and shoulder of 2-point belted ATD during the MDR test. Also, the main source of injuries during the MDR test was partial ejection due to the shattered side window, whereas for the TT test impacts between the ATDs and the side window and/or window frame were the injury causes. From the vehicle point of view, the total energy produced in the MDR was 3.5 times higher than the TT test, but the overall structural deformation in the TT test was higher than MDR test. Overall, the tilt table test provides a more severe scenario compared to the MDR test for the assessment of structural strength. Considering the limited real-world injury data in rollover crashes of buses, the MDR test presented the more realistic occupant responses.}

abstract = {Objective
This paper analyzes the effects of anticipatory competence and driver experience on glance patterns towards visual cues that indicate conflict situations. Background: Prior research has shown that experienced drivers’ visual scanning patterns differ from those of novices. Experienced drivers are less erratic and more systematic in their monitoring of the environment. We have also shown in an earlier study that driving experience improves anticipatory competence in that it leads to a higher number of timely proactive actions in conflict-scenarios (avoidance actions prior to, as opposed to in reaction to a conflict). This paper investigates glance patterns specifically to relevant visual cues in conflict scenarios to determine whether glance patterns of anticipatory drivers who exhibit proactive actions differ from those who do not. It also investigates whether experienced drivers pay more attention to these cues compared to novices. Method: We conducted a simulator experiment with 24 experienced and 24 novice drivers. As part of the experiment, all drivers completed three distinct traffic scenarios, each with a conflict situation. Results: The results show that drivers who exhibited proactive actions had more frequent and longer glances towards conflict-relevant cues than those who did not exhibit any. Similarly, experienced drivers focused on these visual cues more often, and for longer durations compared to novices. Further, experienced drivers who exhibited proactive actions looked at the cues more often compared to experienced drivers who did not exhibit any; there was no significant difference for novice drivers. Conclusion: These findings speak to the role of situation-specific visual cues for anticipatory competence, and to the importance of driver experience to aid in the interpretation of these cues. Future research should seek to confirm our findings in a wider variety of driving scenarios.}

Using a difference-in-differences approach with internal age-based controls, we find evidence of a short-term effect on emergency department visits due to slips on snow and ice during the first year of the intervention (−45% [95% CI: −54, −9] in 2013), which equates to 21.8 injuries prevented (95% CI: 3.34, 39.4). A cost-benefit analysis based on this result suggests that the short-term benefits outweigh the total costs of the intervention (benefit-cost ratio: 6.9 [95% CI: 1.05–12.46]), indicating that this type of subsidy program may be an important tool for the prevention of pedestrian falls among older adults during icy weather conditions. However, replication at other sites is recommended before drawing any strong and general conclusions.}

First, different types of truck drivers were identified using principal component analysis (PCA) and a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) at the macro level. Then, a multilevel model was built to extract the variation properties of speeding behavior at the micro level. Results showed that 40% of the truck drivers tended to drive in a substantially dangerous way and the explained variance proportion of potentially extremely dangerous truck drivers (79.76%) was distinctly higher than that of other types of truck drivers (14.70%˜34.17%). This paper presents a systematic approach to extracting and examining information from a big data source of digital tachograph data. The derived findings make valuable contributions to the development of safety education programs, regulations, and proactive road safety countermeasures and management.}

A dataset of traffic accidents recorded in Valencia (Spain) during 2014 and 2015 is analyzed in order to estimate the effects that school locations produce on traffic risk within their surroundings. The four typologies of school in this city according to the academic levels they offer (All-level, Preschool, Primary, Secondary) are distinguished and taken into consideration for the analysis. Two time windows comprising the starting time in the morning and the evening time once day school has ended are analyzed independently. Several statistical methods are used, including observed vs expected ratios, macroscopic conditional autoregressive modelling, logistic regression in the context of a case–control study design and risk modelling in relation to several school locations. The distances to each type of school and a set of environmental, traffic-related, demographic and socioeconomic covariates are employed for the analysis. The macroscopic modelling of accident counts and the modelling of risk as a function of the distance to each type of school serves to confirm that proximity to a school has an effect on the incidence of traffic accidents in particular time windows. Specifically, school types coexisting in Valencia show differential behaviour in this regard. In addition, several covariates have displayed a positive (bus stop density, complex intersections, main road length) and negative (land use entropy) association with accident counts in the time windows investigated. Finally, the definition of a case–control study design enabled us to observe some differences undetected by the macroscopic approaches that would require further research.}

abstract = {Background
Pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists are vulnerable to serious injury due to limited external protective devices. Understanding the level of recovery, and differences between these road user groups, is an important step towards improved understanding of the burden of road trauma, and prioritisation of prevention efforts. This study aimed to characterise and describe patient-reported outcomes of vulnerable road users at 6 and 12 months following orthopaedic trauma.
Methods
A registry-based cohort study was conducted using data from the Victorian Orthopaedic Trauma Outcomes Registry (VOTOR) and included pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists who were hospitalised for an orthopaedic injury following an on-road collision that occurred between January 2009 and December 2016. Outcomes were measured using the 3-level EuroQol 5 dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D-3 L), Glasgow Outcome Scale – Extended (GOS-E) and return to work questions. Outcomes were collected at 6 and 12 months post-injury. Multivariable generalized estimating equations (GEE), adjusted for confounders, were used to compare outcomes between the road user groups over time.
Results
6186 orthopaedic trauma patients met the inclusion criteria during the 8-year period. Most patients were motorcyclists (42.8%) followed by cyclists (32.6%) and pedestrians (24.6%). Problems were most prevalent on the usual activities item of the EQ-5D-3 L at 6-months post-injury, and the pain/discomfort item of the EQ-5D-3 L at 12 months. The adjusted odds of reporting problems on all EQ-5D-3 L items were lower for cyclists when compared to pedestrians. Moreover, an average cyclist had a greater odds of a good recovery on the GOS-E, (AOR 2.75, 95% CI 2.33, 3.25) and a greater odds of returning to work (AOR = 3.13, 95% CI 2.46, 3.99) compared to an average pedestrian.
Conclusion
Pedestrians and motorcyclists involved in on-road collisions experienced poorer patient-reported outcomes at 6 and 12 months post-injury when compared to cyclists. A focus on both primary injury prevention strategies, and investment in ongoing support and treatment to maximise recovery, is necessary to reduce the burden of road trauma for vulnerable road users.}

The recent advent of ride-hailing services has led to dramatic growth in the fleet of motorcycle taxis and additional types of motorcycle taxi drivers. Furthermore, mobile phone use while riding a motorcycle is an emerging safety issue, particularly among ride-hailing motorcycle taxi drivers. This paper investigates mobile phone use while riding, crashes and mobile phone related crashes among ride-hailing, traditional, and hybrid motorcycle taxi drivers, using data from a survey in Hanoi, Vietnam. Results show that ride-hailing motorcycle taxi drivers had the highest prevalence of mobile phone use while riding a motorcycle taxi (95.3%), followed by hybrid (88.6%) and traditional taxi drivers (64%). Approximately 32.6%, 19.3%, and 9.7% of motorcycle taxi drivers reported being involved in a crash, injury crash, and mobile phone related crash respectively. Mobile phone related crashes represent 20.5% of all reported crashes. Logistic and negative binomial regression were used to explore factors influencing mobile phone use while riding and crash frequencies. Regression results indicate that ride-hailing taxi drivers were more likely to be involved in a mobile phone related crash. Delivery trips were found to be associated with increases in crashes whereas passenger trips were found to be associated with decreases in crashes. Policy implications are also discussed.}

Relevant to the current study was the Behavioural Activation System (BAS; sensitive to reward), with a specific focus on the BAS processes: Reward Interest, Goal-Drive Persistence, Reward Reactivity and Impulsivity, and the Fight-Flight-Freeze System (FFFS; sensitive to punishment). It was hypothesised that young male and female drivers with stronger BAS traits would report lower risk perceptions towards speeding behaviour than those with weaker BAS traits and this risk perception would predict greater intentions to exceed the posted speed limit in 60 km/hr zones. It was further hypothesised that young male and female drivers with stronger FFFS traits would report higher risk perceptions towards speeding behaviour than those with weaker FFFS traits and this risk perception would predict lower intentions to exceed the posted speed limit in 60 km/h zones. Participants were 367 young licensed Australian drivers aged between 17 and 25 years. The results of a mediation analyses showed that females with stronger Impulsivity had low perceptions of risk and higher intentions to speed than participants with weaker Impulsivity. Further, males with stronger Goal-Drive Persistence and reported higher perceptions of risk and lower intentions to speed than participants with weaker Goal-Drive Persistence. Contrary to expectations, the BAS processes of Reward Interest and Reward Reactivity, and the FFFS were not significant. The findings contribute to the theoretical understanding of how the r-RST traits, specifically Goal-Drive Persistence and Impulsivity may influence speeding behaviour as well as the understanding of the unique influence of the four underlying BAS processes.}

However, it is highly likely that the relationships of exposure, risk factors and crash occurrence can vary across different times of day. This study aims to establish time-dependent SPFs for urban roads by using large-scale dangerous driving event data captured by smartphones in different times of day. Multivariate conditional autoregressive (MVCAR) models are developed to jointly account for spatial and temporal dependence of crash observations. Results of two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests affirm the heterogeneity of the safety effects of dangerous driving events in different time periods. Time-dependent hotspots are identified using potential for safety improvement (PSI) metric. The assumption here is that due to the change of traffic conditions and environment across different times of day, safety hotspots for different time periods should be different from each other. According to the results of Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, hotspots identified by times of day are found to be mostly different from each other. The findings of this study provide insights into temporal effects of risk factors and can support the development of time-dependent safety countermeasures. Besides, this study also shows the potential of leveraging anonymized and aggregated dangerous driving data to assess traffic safety issues.}

A Bayesian spatio-temporal model is proposed to measure the association between crash frequency and possible risk factors including traffic composition, presence of curve and slope, weather conditions, and their interactions. The proposed model can also accommodate the unstructured random effect, and spatio-temporal correlation and interactions. Results of parameter estimation indicate that the interactions between wind speed and slope, between precipitation and curve, and between visibility and slope are significantly correlated to the increase in the freeway crash risk, while the interaction between precipitation and slope is significantly correlated to the reduction in the freeway crash risk, respectively.

However, little research has examined how public transport travel contributes to road safety at a macroscopic level. Further, there is a limited understanding of the individual effects of different public transport modes. This paper explores the effects of commuting by public transport on road safety at a macroscopic level, using Melbourne as a case study. A random effect negative binomial (RENB) and a conditional autoregressive (CAR) model are adopted to explore links between total and severe crash data to commuting mode shares and a range of other zonal explanatory factors. Overall, results show the great potential of public transport as a road safety solution. It is evident that mode shift from private vehicle to public transport (i.e. train, tram, and bus), for commuting would reduce not only total crashes, but also severe crashes. Modelling also demonstrated that CAR models outperform RENB models. In addition, results highlight safety issues related to commuting by motorbike and active transport. Effects of sociodemographic, transport network, and land use factors on crashes at the macroscopic level are also discussed.}

abstract = {Negative binomial (NB) regression is among the most common statistical modeling methods used to model crash frequencies due to its simple functional form and ability to handle over-dispersion commonly found in crash data. However, a drawback of this approach is that regression parameters are assumed to be the same across observations, which could contribute to biased parameter estimates. To alleviate this concern, the random parameters negative binomial (RPNB) model was recently proposed, which allows regression parameters to differ across observations following some known distribution. The resulting coefficients should be less biased, and thus the RPNB approach is believed to provide a more accurate relationship between independent variables and expected crash frequency. However, the prediction accuracy of the RPNB model relative to the standard NB model has not been thoroughly evaluated, particularly with respect to out-of-sample observations for which unique random parameters cannot be estimated. In this paper, the predictive power of the RPNB and NB models are examined using two-lane rural highway data from three engineering Districts in Pennsylvania. Multiple evaluation metrics are applied—root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), coefficients from calibration functions and cumulative residual (CURE) plots—to assess each model type. The results show that the RPNB model outperforms the NB model when applied to within sample observations (i.e., those used to estimate the model) by making use of the observation-specific coefficients. However, the predictive power of the RPNB model appears to be similar to or slightly less precise than the traditional NB model when applied to out-of-sample observations. Since the RPNB model is estimated using a simulation-based approach, sensitivity tests were also performed to see how the parameter estimates change with the number of Halton draws used to perform the simulation. For the sample sizes used in this paper, the estimates were fairly insensitive when more than 50 Halton draws were used. The findings suggest that the RPNB model is more reliable when applied to the same set of sites that were used to estimate the model but might not be as robust as the traditional NB model when applied to other sites.}

However, a significant number of pedestrian fatalities occur at signalized intersections, which may primarily be due to pedestrians’ violation behaviors. Since pedestrians’ fatalities are not uniform across signalized intersections in a city, it may be expected that violations would also vary across the sites. It is thus worthwhile to investigate if the pedestrian signal violation is a good surrogate for fatal pedestrian crashes at signalized intersections, and if so, what behavioral, spatial, and built environment related factors influence such violations. To this end, present study analyzes pedestrian behavior and perceptions across twenty-four signalized intersections in Kolkata city, India, out of which twelve intersections did not record any fatal pedestrian crashes between 2011 and 2016 and the remaining twelve experienced at least three or more fatal pedestrian crashes over the same period. Using data from the video-graphic survey at these twenty-four signalized intersections violation behaviors are extracted along with personal attributes at the pedestrian level. Further, pedestrian perception surveys are carried out at each of the twenty-four sites, to obtain a user’s perception of safety and satisfaction. Results indicate that pedestrians’ signal violations behavior and dissatisfaction are statistically significantly higher at locations with recorded fatal pedestrian crashes. Results from different models and analysis clearly pointed out several planning and design deficiencies such as longer waiting time before crossing, higher pedestrian-vehicular interaction, pedestrian’s state of crossing, and a number of personal level attributes such as pedestrian’s intended mode of transportation and their state of journey, pedestrian’s home location, pedestrian’s socio-demographic characteristics as important predictors of pedestrians’ violation behavior. The methodology and findings are useful not only for proactive safety improvement at signalized intersections but also to proactively identify potential unsafe sites.}

However, some have raised concerns that the increased speed and the increased weight of the e-bike can lead to more accidents among cyclists riding an e-bike, as compared to conventional bicycles. Furthermore, it has been suggested that e-bikes may appeal to new groups of cyclists with little cycling experience, which may further impede cyclist safety. Previous research has not provided a clear picture. We investigate these questions with data from three surveys carried out in Norway (N = 7752). A logistic regression analysis comparing conventional and electric bicycles, controlling for age gender and exposure, shows an overall risk increase (all accidents) for e-bike users. The results suggest that this increased risk derives from females having a higher accident risk on e-bikes. For men there is no risk difference between e-bikes and conventional bikes. Some, but not all, of this elevated risk can be attributed to being unfamiliar with the bicycle. E-bikes are not more likely to cause serious accidents than conventional bicycles. In-depth analysis of accident causation showed that there was no difference in the factors leading to accidents, except that there was a somewhat higher prevalence of accidents resulting from balance problems with e-bikes.}

abstract = {As a way of obtaining a visual expression of knowledge, mapping knowledge domain (MKD) provides a vision-based analytic approach to scientometric analysis which can be used to reveal an academic community, the structure of its networks, and the dynamic development of a discipline. This study, based on the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) articles on road safety, employs the bibliometric tools VOSviewer and CitNetExplorer to create maps of author co-citation, document co-citation, citation networks, analyze the core authors and classic documents supporting road safety studies and show the citation context and development of such studies. It shows that road safety studies clustered mainly into four groups, whose we will refer to as “effects of driving psychology and behavior on road safety”, “causation, frequency and injury severity analysis of road crashes”, “epidemiology, assessment and prevention of road traffic injury”, and “effects of driver risk factors on driver performance and road safety”, respectively. Through our analysis, the core publications and their citation relationships were quickly located and explored, and “crash frequency modeling analysis” has been identified to be the core research topic in road safety studies, with spatial statistical analysis technique emerging as a frontier of this topic.}

abstract = {Although most of the literature on traffic safety analysis has been developed over areal zones, there is a growing interest in using the specific road structure of the region under investigation, which is known as a linear network in the field of spatial statistics. The use of linear networks entails several technical complications, ranging from the accurate location of traffic accidents to the definition of covariates at a spatial micro-level. Therefore, the primary goal of this study was to display a detailed analysis of a dataset of traffic accidents recorded in Valencia (Spain), which were located into a linear network representing more than 30 km of urban road structure corresponding to one district of the city. A set of traffic-related covariates was constructed at the road segment level for performing the analysis. Several issues and methodological approaches that are inherent to linear networks have been shown and discussed. In particular, the network was defined in a way that allowed the explicit investigation of traffic accidents around road intersections and the consideration of traffic flow directionality. Zero-inflated negative binomial count models accounting for spatial heterogeneity were used. Traffic safety at road intersections was specifically taken into account in the analysis by considering the higher variability and number of zeros that can be observed at these road entities and the differential contribution of the covariates depending on the proximity of a road intersection. To complement the results obtained from the count models fitted, coldspots and hotspots along the network were also detected, with explanatory objectives. The models confirmed that spatial heterogeneity, overdispersion and the close presence of road intersections explain the accident counts observed in the road network analyzed. Hotspot detection revealed that several covariates whose contribution was unclear in the modelling approaches may also be affecting accident counts at the road segment level.}

abstract = {Two-wheeled vehicles (motorized and non-motorized, referred to as TWs) are an important part of the transport system in China. They also represent an important challenge for road safety, with many TW user fatalities and injuries every year. Recently, active safety systems for cars, such as Automated Emergency Braking (AEB), promise to reduce road traffic fatalities and injuries. For these systems to work effectively, it is necessary to understand and define the complex traffic scenarios to be addressed. The aim of this study is to contribute to the development of test procedures for AEB specifically, drawing on the China In-Depth Accident Study (CIDAS) data from July 2011 to February 2016 to describe typical scenarios for crashes between cars and TWs by means of cluster analysis. In total, 672 car-to-TW crashes were extracted. The data was clustered according to five main crash characteristics: time of crash, view obstruction, pre-crash driving behavior of the car driver and the TW driver, and relative moving direction. The analysis resulted in six car-to-TW crash scenarios typical of China. In three scenarios the car and the TW travel perpendicularly to each other before the crash, in two they travel in the same direction, and in one they travel in opposite directions. Further, each scenario can be described with three characteristics (the road speed limit, the TW’s first contact point on the car, and the car’s first contact point on the TW) that can be included in an AEB test suite. Some scenarios were similar to those in the Euro New Car Assessment Program (Euro NCAP). For example, in one, a TW moving straight ahead was hit by a car moving perpendicularly, and in the other the car hit a TW traveling in the same direction. Both occurred in daytime, without a visual obstruction. However, in contrast to the Euro NCAP, typical scenarios in China included night-time scenarios, scenarios where the car or the TW was turning, and those in which the TW was hidden from the car by an obstruction. The results contribute to a proposed novel AEB test suite with realistic scenarios specific to China.}

In separate analyses, we evaluated fatal crash rates before and after commercial marijuana dispensaries began operating in 2014. In the five years after legalization, fatal crash rates increased more in Colorado and Washington than would be expected had they continued to parallel crash rates in the control states (+1.2 crashes/billion vehicle miles traveled, CI: -0.6 to 2.1, p = 0.087), but not significantly so. The effect was more pronounced and statistically significant after the opening of commercial dispensaries (+1.8 crashes/billion vehicle miles traveled, CI: +0.4 to +3.7, p = 0.020). These data provide evidence of the need for policy strategies to mitigate increasing crash risks as more states legalize recreational marijuana.}

abstract = {The sequence of instantaneous driving decisions and its variations, known as driving volatility, prior to involvement in safety critical events can be a leading indicator of safety. This study focuses on the component of “driving volatility matrix” related to specific normal and safety-critical events, named “event-based volatility.” The research issue is characterizing volatility in instantaneous driving decisions in the longitudinal and lateral directions, and how it varies across drivers involved in normal driving, crash, and/or near-crash events. To explore the issue, a rigorous quasi-experimental study design is adopted to help compare driving behaviors in normal vs unsafe outcomes. Using a unique real-world naturalistic driving database from the 2nd Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP), a test set of 9593 driving events featuring 2.2 million temporal samples of real-world driving are analyzed. This study features a plethora of kinematic sensors, video, and radar spatiotemporal data about vehicle movement and therefore offers the opportunity to initiate such exploration. By using information related to longitudinal and lateral accelerations and vehicular jerk, 24 different aggregate and segmented measures of driving volatility are proposed that captures variations in extreme instantaneous driving decisions. In doing so, careful attention is given to the issue of intentional vs. unintentional volatility. The volatility indices, as leading indicators of near-crash and crash events, are then linked with safety critical events, crash propensity, and other event specific explanatory variables. Owing to the presence of unobserved heterogeneity and omitted variable bias, fixed- and random-parameter discrete choice models are developed that relate crash propensity to unintentional driving volatility and other factors. Statistically significant evidence is found that driver volatilities in near-crash and crash events are significantly greater than volatility in normal driving events. After controlling for traffic, roadway, and unobserved factors, the results suggest that greater intentional volatility increases the likelihood of both crash and near-crash events. A one-unit increase in intentional volatility is associated with positive vehicular jerk in longitudinal direction increases the chance of crash and near-crash outcome by 15.79 and 12.52 percentage points, respectively. Importantly, intentional volatility in positive vehicular jerk in lateral direction has more negative consequences than intentional volatility in positive vehicular jerk in longitudinal direction. Compared to acceleration/deceleration, vehicular jerk can better characterize the volatility in microscopic instantaneous driving decisions prior to involvement in safety critical events. Finally, the magnitudes of correlations exhibit significant heterogeneity, and that accounting for the heterogeneous effects in the modeling framework can provide more reliable and accurate results. The study demonstrates the value of quasi-experimental study design and big data analytics for understanding extreme driving behaviors in safe vs. unsafe driving outcomes.}

This article introduces a novel method known as the Markov chain spatial model to incorporate the spatial effects into the temporal dynamic of the fatality rates. Compared to the traditional Markov chain model, the proposed spatial Markov chain model can quantify the influence of neighboring sites explicitly in the transition process. A case study using a long duration dataset, from 1975 to 2015 in the 48 lower states of the United Sates, was conducted to illustrate the proposed model. The fatality rates were measured as the number of traffic fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles or per 10,000 residents. The results show that the probability of transition for one state between different levels of traffic fatality risks depends largely on the context of its surrounding neighbors. Another important finding is that relative to the estimates of traditional Markov chain models, states surrounded by neighborhoods with relatively low fatality rates take a longer time to transform to a higher level of fatality risk in the spatial Markov chain model. On the other hand, those with high-risk neighborhoods takes less time to deteriorate. These findings confirm that it is imperative to incorporate spatial effects when modeling the temporal dynamic of safety indicators to assess and monitor the safety trends in the areas of interest.}

The total number of accidents was observed in this paper, along with the number of motorized and non-motorized mode accidents within a three-year period in the city of Novi Sad. The models used for this analysis were spatial predictive models comprised of the classical predictive space model, spatial lag model and spatial error model. The spatial lag model showed the best performances concerning the total number of accidents and number of motorized mode accidents, whereas the spatial error model was prominent within the number of non-motorized mode accidents. The results found that increasing Daily Vehicle-Kilometers Traveled, parking spaces, 5-legged intersections and signalized intersections increased all types of accidents. The other demographic, traffic, road and environment characteristics showed that they had a different effect on the observed types of accidents. The results of this research can be benefitial to reserachers who deal with traffic engineering, space planning as well as making decisions with the aim of preparing countermeasures necessary for road safety improvement in the analysed area.}

Semistructured interview surveys were conducted with 18 elderly people who had experienced a crash with a vehicle as a pedestrian aged 65 years or older. Personal construct theory is adopted as the theoretical underpinning, and it is assumed that pedestrians have their own subjective ways of making sense of the crashes they are involved in. It was found that 11 of the 18 participants ascribed the crashes at least in part to their own self-regulation failures. Cognitive maps of the 11 participants had a common structure, and the associated 11 incidents were classified with respect to the following dimensions: (a) self-regulation type, (b) self-regulation motivation, (c) cause of self-regulation failure, and (d) characteristics of the collisions that occurred after the self-regulation failure. Based on these findings, practical implications are found, and corresponding interventions that may reduce elderly pedestrian–vehicle crashes of this type are discussed. Specifically, this study demonstrates the necessity of education or other intervention that goes beyond informing elderly pedestrians of what is right and wrong in traffic environments. Another critical result—the need to motivate elderly pedestrians to respect and adhere to their own highly personal self-regulation, even if it is not against the social norms—is also presented and discussed.}

We collected and (re-)analyzed evidence in order to conduct cost-benefit analyses (CBAs) for 29 road safety measures. The information on crash costs was based on data from a survey in European countries. We applied a systematic procedure including corrections for inflation and Purchasing Power Parity in order to express all the monetary information in the same units (EUR, 2015). Cost-benefit analyses were done for measures with favorable estimated effects on road safety and for which relevant information on costs could be found. Results were assessed in terms of benefit-to-cost ratios and net present value. In order to account for some uncertainties, we carried out sensitivity analyses based on varying assumptions for costs of measures and measure effectiveness. Moreover we defined some combinations used as best case and worst case scenarios. In the best estimate scenario, 25 measures turn out to be cost-effective. 4 measures (road lighting, automatic barriers installation, area wide traffic calming and mandatory eyesight tests) are not cost-effective according to this scenario. In total, 14 measures remain cost-effective throughout all scenarios, whereas 10 other measures switch from cost-effective in the best case scenario to not cost-effective in the worst case scenario. For three measures insufficient information is available to calculate all scenarios. Two measures (automatic barriers installation and area wide traffic calming) even in the best case do not become cost-effective. Inherent uncertainties tend to be present in the underlying data on costs of measures, effects and target groups. Results of CBAs are not necessarily generally valid or directly transferable to other settings.}

It also helps identify and prevent crashes before they happen. However, collecting real-time wide-coverage traffic information for crash prediction has been challenging. More importantly, previous studies have failed to consider the characteristics of the traffic platoon (vehicle group) that the crash vehicle belongs to before the crash occurs. This paper aims to model crash propensity based on traffic platoon characteristics collected by the floating car method, which provides a time-efficient and reliable solution to collecting traffic information. Crash and floating car data are collected from the Middle Ring Expressway in Shanghai, China. Both the binary logistic model and the support vector machine are applied. A data preparation method, involving crash data filtering, floating car data filtering and data matching on the road network, is introduced for the safety analysis purpose. Results suggest that the traffic platoon information collected from floating cars accompanied works reasonably in predicting crashes on expressways. The support vector machine, with an overall accuracy of 85%, outperformed the binary logistic model which had an overall accuracy of 60%. Results further suggest the application of floating car technologies and the support vector machine in real-time crash prediction. Despite this, the study also concludes the merits of the binary logistic model over the support vector machine model in explaining the impact of different factors that contribute to crash occurrences.}

The model was built by incorporating drivers’ speed risk perception and distance risk perception as latent variables. A series of on-road experiments was conducted on the curved segments of a freeway in China to collect naturalistic driving data to approximate the model. The results indicate that (1) the amount of variance in speed risk perception accounted for by the temporal and spatial frequency and the following vehicle type was 21%; (2) the amount of variance in distance risk perception accounted for by the temporal and spatial frequency, leading vehicle type, stopping sight distance (SSD), horizontal sightline offset (HSO), and radius was 29%; and (3) speed risk perception and distance risk perception explained 27% of the total variance in crash risk variation, which is significantly higher than previous similar results that were commonly limited to 10%. The results were explained from the perspective of the effect of line markings, vehicle type (size), and curves on driving behaviors, respectively. In addition, the difference between the effect of speed risk perception and distance perception on crash risk variation was discussed considering the direct and indirect origins of risk in driving. The findings suggests that the incorporation of visual perceptual, vehicular, and roadway factors and its relevant speed risk perception and distance risk perception can better explain the crash risk in car-following. This study also emphasized the possibility and the need of applying the line markings as a visual intervention to prevent the drivers from rear-end crashes on curves, which may provide new insights and be a new solution for roadway safety.}

The study was based on a questionnaire survey carried out among a representative sample (n = 2000) of the Norwegian population. The results showed differences in how people perceived risk and how worried they were about being exposed to different hazards (traffic accident, harassment, theft, and terror) as a pedestrian during night-time and daytime. As expected, pedestrians perceived their risk as higher and were more worried being exposed to hazards during night-time than in daytime. Structural equation modelling (SEM) revealed that risk perception was a significant predictor variable for worry during both night-time and daytime. Additionally, worry was found to influence pedestrian behaviour. Worry was moderately associated with walking frequency during night-time, and how often individuals walked alone outdoors during night-time. These associations were stronger for people without access to a private car. No associations were found between worry and walking frequency during daytime. The results of the study contribute to the understanding of the association between pedestrians’ risk perceptions and worry, and how worry influence walking frequency. From both a pro-environmental and a health promoting perspective, it is important that people choose to walk or cycle for their daily travels.}

abstract = {In recent years, the popularity of all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) in the United States (US) has increased, and the number of ATV driver and passenger deaths have also increased substantially in the last few decades. Riders or occupants of ATVs as well as golf carts are particularly vulnerable to injury, not only due to the lack of protection and safety equipment offered by their vehicles, but also the propensity for ejection in the event of a crash. Given the vulnerability of these road users, it’s critical to understand factors which may affect injury severity to plan effective countermeasures aimed at reducing these injuries and fatalities. To better understand factors affecting the injury severity of ATV and golf cart riders or occupants involved in police-reported crashes, this study presents an analysis using six years of crash data from the US state of Arizona. Over the analysis period, there were 1769 drivers/passengers of these vehicle types involved in police-reported crashes. Of these occupants/riders, 67.7% were injured or killed as a result of the crash; a proportion significantly higher than police-reported crashes involving most other vehicle types, exhibiting the need to examine factors leading to these injuries and fatalities. In order to analyse factors affecting the injury severity of ATV and golf cart occupants/riders, a random parameters (RP) ordered logit statistical model was developed, which was most appropriate given the ordered nature of injury-severity data. Several person- vehicle- roadway- and environmental-related variables were found to significantly affect the injury severity of riders or occupants of ATVs and golf carts. Given the vulnerability of these road users, it’s important for transportation agencies to explore effective countermeasures aimed at reducing the severity of crashes involving these vehicle types. The results of this study provide important insights which can assist in developing effective engineering-, enforcement-, education, or policy-related countermeasures.}

abstract = {The safety of roadside restraint systems in Europe is ensured by the EN 1317 regulation. The ability of the barrier to mitigate injury to the occupants of vehicles is tested according to two occupant injury metrics: Acceleration Severity Index (ASI) and Theoretical Head Impact Velocity (THIV). Both metrics aim to predict occupant head injury from vehicle kinematics, despite the potential to easily measure actual head kinematics from instrumented Anthropomorphic Test Dummies, a non-instrumented version of which is already required according to the regulation. Retrospective data provided by AISICO S.r.l. for 33 certificated barrier tests, where acceleration of the dummy’s head had also been recorded, were re-analysed. ASI and THIV were compared with Head Injury Criterion (HIC15) and Neck injury Criterion (Nij), as well as corresponding Real Head Impact Velocity (RHIV) values. Three barriers presented HIC15 values above the threshold used in crashworthiness testing, two of which corresponded to fatal injury according to the Abbreviated Injury Scale. One barrier presented an Nij value corresponding to a 30% risk of neck injury. RHIV values were above the regulation threshold in 15% of tests, but were not significantly different from the corresponding THIV values. It was concluded that vehicle kinematics do not accurately predict head kinematics during barrier testing. The presented data indicate the current EN 1317 regulation was not capable of detecting all potential dangerous outcomes, with the potential to underestimate occupant risk. Further investigation is necessary to devise suitable indices based on actual head and neck data. These data would be obtained from a dummy instrumented with both a head accelerometer and neck load cell and, possibly, a gyroscope. To consistently test the true worst-case scenario, the tested side window should be closed and non-reinforced.}

Many studies have used either driving data or physiological data such as electroencephalography (EEG) to estimate and monitor driving states.

To fill these research gaps aforementioned, this study adopts two EEG analysis techniques (i.e., independent component analysis and brain source localization), two signal processing methods (i.e., power spectrum analysis and wavelets analysis) to extract twelve kinds of EEG features for the short-term driving state prediction. The prediction performance of driving features, EEG features and hybrid features of them was evaluated and compared. The results indicated that EEG-based model has better performance than driving-data-based model (i.e., 83.84% versus 71.59%) and the integrated model of driving features and the full brain regions features extracted by wavelet analysis outperforms other types of features with the highest accuracy of 86.27%.}

The interactions between these characteristics in determining accident risk in horizontal curves is only beginning to be understood. This paper summarises the results of studies that have investigated the interaction between the radius of a horizontal curve and the distance to adjacent curves. The shorter the mean distance between curves, the lower is the increase in risk for a given curve radius. The sharper neighbouring curves are, the lower is the increase in risk for a given curve radius. Thus, overall risk may not be higher on a road consisting mostly of sharp curves than on a road consisting mostly of straight sections with a few curves located far apart from each other.}

To this aim, a Bayesian Belief Network model is developed, which includes variables related to the maritime accident but also to the different wave conditions. For the quantification of the conditional probability tables the maritime accident database of the Portuguese Maritime Authority is used, which includes 857 validated accidents registered in the period 1997–2006. Similarly, several significant wave height databases are used to populate the node correspondent to this variable. The importance of accurate estimation of the significant wave height is also discussed. To substantiate this discussion a comparison between hard evidence (ε) and a soft one (μ,σ) is performed for the significant wave height node of the BBN model. The application of different combinations of evidence in the model allows the identification of patterns of influence of the human error cause in comparison with others, namely with the sea and weather one. The results show one apparent high-risk acceptance within the crews of the fishing vessels and low risk perception in the recreational vessels. Based on the results, are provided recommendations to decrease the risk associated to specific probable causes.}

This paper proposes a novel score-based traffic law-enforcement and network management system (SLEM) that is based on connected vehicles (CV) technology. SLEM assigns a score to each driver which reflects her/his driving performance and compliance with traffic laws. The proposed system adopts a rewarding mechanism that rewards high-performing drivers and penalizes low-performing drivers who fail to obey the laws. The reward mechanism is in the form of a route guidance strategy that restricts low-score drivers from accessing certain roadway sections and time periods that are strategically selected in order to achieve an optimal traffic pattern in the network in which high-score drivers experience less congestion and a higher level of safety. A nationwide survey study was conducted to measure public acceptance of the proposed system. Another survey targeted a focused group of traffic operation and safety professionals. Based on the results of these surveys, a set of logistic regression models were developed to examine the sensitivity of public acceptance to policy and behavioral variables. The results showed that about 65.7 percent of the public and about 60.0 percent of professionals who participated in this study support the real-world implementation of SLEM.}

The visible presence of policing activities alongside roadways seems to be significant in preventing driver distraction and other unsafe driving behaviors. The purpose of this study was to provide evidence of the effectiveness of visible policing presence on drivers’ self-reported intention to refrain from non-driving activities and that this effectiveness can be enhanced by manipulating deployment even with limited resources. We conducted a scenario-based survey to compare drivers’ self-reported intention to refrain from non-driving activities and their vigilance state across several hypothetical driving situations. The three aims of the study were to examine whether drivers’ self-reported vigilance and intention to refrain from non-driving activities were associated with (a) the presence or absence of common forms of roadside policing, (b) the agent (police vs. civilian) and medium (human vs. advertisement) of road safety interventions, and (c) different forms of policing (police officer vs. police car) and their respective levels of conspicuousness. Japanese drivers (N = 367) were randomly assigned to receive one of three booklets that included a scenario-based survey. The three booklets contained different combinations of various hypothetical driving scenarios based on the three experiment designs (a, b, c) described above. Participants were asked to rate their vigilance and their intention to refrain from non-driving activities in hypothetical driving situations that varied by the presence or absence of policing and how conspicuous that presence was. We conducted repeated measures within-subject analysis of variance using the three experimental designs. The results showed that the presence of a single police unit engaged in policing activities was associated with more vigilance and greater intention to refrain from non-driving activities. The results suggested that effectiveness of visible policing could be enhanced by increasing conspicuousness of police officers in order to help drivers more easily recognize the presence of police without having to purchase extra equipment. These findings provide useful insights for traffic police to conduct routine policing practices more efficiently to address non-driving activities. Future research is needed to examine these results in a real-world setting.}

E2W riders and bicyclists behave similarly as vulnerable road users (VRUs), while exhibited dissimilarities in riding postures and interactions with the two-wheelers. Existing epidemiology reveals prominent differences in injury risks between E2W riders and other vulnerable road users in collisions with motor vehicles. The objective of this study is to investigate the factors influencing kinematics and head injury risks of two-wheeler rides in two-wheeler-vehicle collisions and compare between E2W-vehicle and bicycle-vehicle collisions. Via multi-body modeling of two two-wheeler types, two vehicle types, and three rider statures in MADYMO, twelve collision scenarios were developed. A simulation matrix considering a range of impact velocities and relative positions was performed for each scenario. A subsequent parametric analysis was conducted with focus on the kinematics and head injury risks of two-wheeler riders. Results show that the head injury risk increased with vehicle moving velocity, while the two-wheeler velocity and relative location between rider and vehicle prior to the collision exhibited highly non-linear influence on the kinematical response. The rider with larger stature had higher possibilities to miss head impact on the vehicle. In collisions with the sedan, E2W riders would sustain lower head injury risks with lower contacting velocity on the windshield than bicyclists. While in collisions with the SUV, E2W riders would sustain increasing head injury risks due to the higher structural stiffness at contact, and the risk level was about the same as bicyclists. The findings revealed the loading mechanisms behind the different head injury risks between E2W riders and bicyclists.}

Evaluating the safety impact of intersection features requires methods to quantify relationships between different factors and pedestrian injuries. The purpose of this paper is to model the effects of exposure, geometry, and signalization on pedestrian injuries at urban signalized intersections using a Full Bayes spatial Poisson Log-Normal model that accounts for unobserved heterogeneity and spatial correlation. Using the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) technique, this work leverages a rich database of geometric and signalization variables for 1864 intersections in Montreal, Quebec. To collect exposure data, short-term pedestrian and vehicle counts were extrapolated to AADT using developed expansion factors. Results of the model confirmed the positive relationship between pedestrian and vehicle volumes and pedestrian injuries. Curb extensions, raised medians, and exclusive left turn lanes were all found to reduce pedestrian injuries, while the total number of lanes and the number of commercial entrances were found to increase them. Pedestrian priority phases reduced injuries while the green straight arrow increased injuries. Lastly, the posterior expected number of crashes was used to identify hotspots. The proposed ranking criteria identified many intersections close to the city centre where the expected number of crashes is highest and intersections along arterials with lower pedestrian volumes where individual pedestrian risk is elevated. Understanding the effects of intersection geometry and pedestrian signalization will aid in ensuring the safety of pedestrians at signalized intersections.}

abstract = {The motorcyclist is exposed to the risk of falling and impacting ground head-first at a wide range of travelling speeds – from a speed limit of less than 50 km/h on the urban road to the race circuit where speed can reach well above 200 km/h. However, motorcycle helmets today are tested at a single and much lower impact speed, i.e. 30 km/h. There is a knowledge gap in understanding the dynamics and head impact responses at high travelling speeds due to the limitation of existing laboratory rigs. This study used a finite element head model coupled with a motorcycle helmet model to simulate head-first falls at travelling speed (or tangential velocity at impact) from 0 to 216 km/h. The effect of different falling heights (1.6 m and 0.25 m) and coefficient of frictions (0.20 and 0.45) between the helmet outer shell and ground were also examined. The simulation results were analysed together with the analytical model to better comprehend rolling and/or sliding phenomena that are often observed in helmet oblique impacts. Three types of helmet-to-ground interactions are found when the helmet impacts ground from low to high tangential velocities: (1) helmet rolling without slipping; (2) a combination of sliding and rolling; and (3) continuous sliding. The tangential impulse transmitted to the head-helmet system, peak angular head kinematics and brain strain increase almost linearly with the tangential velocity when the helmet rolls but plateaus when the helmet slides. The critical tangential velocity at which the motion transit from the rolling regime to the sliding regime depends on both the falling height and friction coefficient. Typically, for a fall height of 1.63 m and a friction coefficient of 0.45, the rolling/sliding transition occurs at a tangential velocity of 10.8 m/s (38.9 km/h). Low sliding resistance in helmet design, i.e. by the means of a lower friction coefficient between the helmet outer shell and ground, has shown a higher reduction of brain tissue strain in the sliding regime than in the rolling regime. This study uncovers the underlying dynamics of rolling and sliding phenomena in high-speed oblique impacts, which largely affect head impact biomechanics. Besides, the study highlights the importance of testing helmets at speeds covering both the rolling and sliding regime since potential designs for improved head protection at high-speed impacts can be more distinguishable in the sliding regime than in the rolling regime.}

Red light running and inconsistent stopping behavior may increase the risk for angular and rear-end crashes. This study aims to investigate the effect of different innovative countermeasures on red light running prevention and safe stopping behavior at signalized intersections. Five different conditions were tested inviting sixty-seven volunteers with a valid driving license. The conditions include a default traffic signal setting (control condition), flashing green signal setting (F-green), red LED ground lights integrated with a traffic signal (R-LED), yellow interval countdown variable message sign (C-VMS), and red light running detection camera warning gantry (RW-gantry). Drivers in each condition were exposed to two different situations based on the distance from the stop line. In the first situation, drivers were located in the indecision zone while in the second situation they were located in the likely stopping zone. A series of logistic regression analyses and linear mixed models were conducted to investigate the overall safety effects of the different countermeasures. The probability of red light running (RLR) was significantly reduced for R-LED in both analyses (i.e. in the total sample, and in the sample of crossed vehicles). Moreover, a clearly inconsistent stopping behavior was observed for the flashing green condition. Furthermore, a unit increase in speed (kph) at the onset of yellow interval significantly increases the probability of RLR by 5.3 %. The study showed that R-LED was the most effective solution for improving red light running prevention and encouraging a consistent stopping behavior at the intersection. In conclusion, the R-LED and the RW-gantry treatments are recommended as effective tools to improve safety at signalized intersections.}

Side crashes between vehicles which usually lead to high casualties and property loss, rank first among total crashes in China. This paper aims to identify the factors associated with injury severity of side crashes at intersections and to provide suggestions for developing countermeasures to mitigate the levels of injuries.
Method
In order to investigate the role of striking and struck vehicles in side crashes simultaneously, bivariate probit model was proposed and Bayesian approach was employed to evaluate the model, compared to the corresponding univariate probit model.
Data
Crash data from Beijing, China for the period 2009–2012 were used to carry out the statistical analysis. Based on the investigation with vehicles and data analysis on events, 130 intersection side crash cases were selected to form a specific dataset. Then, the influence of human, vehicles, roadway and environmental variables on crash severity was examined by means of bivariate probit regression within Bayesian framework.
Results
The effects of the factors on striking vehicle drivers and struck vehicle drivers were considered separately and simultaneously to find more targeted conclusions. The statistical analysis revealed vehicle type, lane number, no non-motorized lane and speeding have the corresponding influence on the injury severity of striking vehicles, while time of day and vehicle type of struck vehicles increased the likelihood of being injured.
Conclusions
From the results it can be concluded that there indeed exists correlation between striking and struck vehicles in side crashes, although the correlation is not so strong. Importantly, Bayesian bivariate probit model can address the role of striking and struck vehicles in side crashes simultaneously and can accommodate the correlation clearly, which extends the range of univariate probit analysis. The general and empirical countermeasures are presented to improve the safety at intersections.}

To counter this, governments are focusing on enforcing safe and law-abiding behavior in traffic. However, especially in developing countries where the motorcycle is the main form of transportation, there is a lack of comprehensive data on the safety-critical behavioral metric of motorcycle helmet use. This lack of data prohibits targeted enforcement and education campaigns which are crucial for injury prevention. Hence, we have developed an algorithm for the automated registration of motorcycle helmet usage from video data, using a deep learning approach. Based on 91,000 annotated frames of video data, collected at multiple observation sites in 7 cities across the country of Myanmar, we trained our algorithm to detect active motorcycles, the number and position of riders on the motorcycle, as well as their helmet use. An analysis of the algorithm's accuracy on an annotated test data set, and a comparison to available human-registered helmet use data reveals a high accuracy of our approach. Our algorithm registers motorcycle helmet use rates with an accuracy of −4.4% and +2.1% in comparison to a human observer, with minimal training for individual observation sites. Without observation site specific training, the accuracy of helmet use detection decreases slightly, depending on a number of factors. Our approach can be implemented in existing roadside traffic surveillance infrastructure and can facilitate targeted data-driven injury prevention campaigns with real-time speed. Implications of the proposed method, as well as measures that can further improve detection accuracy are discussed.}

abstract = {Using data from the national register of police-reported crashes and from the bridge register of the Norwegian Public Roads Administration, we estimated rates of single-vehicle crashes on road sections adjacent to road bridges and on different sections of the bridges. Data included all single-vehicle personal injury crashes occurring on or close to road bridges in Norway between 2010 and 2016, a total of 219 crashes. All bridges on state and county roads were included. Crash rate was found to be highest in the approach zone of short bridges (last 50 m before bridge) and lowest in the middle of long bridges. On bridges shorter than about 100 m, crash rate was higher in the first than in the last bridge zone. Total crash rate on bridges was close to the figure for the total road network. However, for the approach to short bridges, crash rate was significantly higher than for the total road network, and for the middle part of long bridges it was significantly lower. A supplementary analysis of in-depth data from 31 fatal crashes including both single-vehicle and multiple-vehicle crashes supported the results from the main analysis. A higher proportion of fatal crashes occurred on approaching or entering a bridge than when leaving the bridge, as seen from the direction of travel of the at-fault vehicle. Concerning countermeasures against bridge accidents, particular attention should be payed to the approach zone and to the design of barriers.}

abstract = {Previous studies have acknowledged the impact of risk perception on safety behavior, but were largely controversial. This study aims to clarify this conflict and the mechanism through which risk perception can have an impact on safety behavior. From the perspective of the dual attribute of the job demand concept in job demands–resources theory, we posit that risk perception can be considered as a job hindrance or a job challenge depending on the context, thereby resulting in a negative or positive impact on safety behavior, respectively. The current research context is the construction industry and the hypotheses were tested using hierarchically nested data collected from 311 workers in 35 workgroups. Risk perception was demonstrated to be a job hindrance exerting a negative impact on safety behavior and safety motivation mediated this effect. In addition, two dimensions of group-level safety climate––supervisor’s and coworkers’––were expected to alleviate or even reverse the detrimental effects of hindrance risk perception on safety motivation and on safety behavior via motivation. A moderation model and a first-stage moderated mediation model were established, respectively, for testing the moderating roles of safety climate in the relationship between risk perception and safety motivation, and in the indirect relationship of risk perception with safety behavior via motivation. Surprisingly, contrary to the hypotheses, when supervisor’s safety climate changed from a low level to a high level, the impact of risk perception on safety motivation changed from positive to negative, and the negative effect of risk perception on safety behavior via safety motivation was not alleviated but worsened. As expected, for workers in a positive coworkers’ safety climate, the negative effect of risk perception on motivation and the indirect negative effect of risk perception on behavior were both reversed to the positive. This indicates that coworkers’ safety climate helped to change perceived risk from a job hindrance to a challenge. This research contributes to workplace risk perception and safety behavior research by theoretically viewing risk perception as a dual job hindrance–challenge concept and proposing two competing hypotheses concerning the impact of risk perception on safety behavior. The empirical investigation confirmed the hindrance attribute of risk perception in the construction context. It provides a theoretical framework and empirical evidence for future research to synthesize the conflict risk perception–safety behavior relationship. We also contribute to the literature by pointing out the potential negative role of certain supervisor safety activities such as paternalistic leadership in influencing employee safety.}

This study demonstrates an improvement over the conventional grid-based analysis to estimate surrogate safety measures (SSM). An advanced pattern-based approach to categorize pedestrian-vehicle interactions based on the road user behavior is proposed in the study. A concept of a two-interaction pattern has been applied, which deals with the responsive and non -responsive behavior of the road users, respectively. The behavior-based patterns were categorized based on the SSM like Speed, Time to Collision, and Gap Time profiles of the pedestrian and vehicle interacting on an un-signalized intersection. On conducting a variable importance test, i.e., k-fold test, it was comprehended that, for pattern-1, Time to collision (TTC), and for pattern-2 both TTC and Post Encroachment Time (PET) were showing required importance. Further, Import Vector Machine (IVM) approach was used to classify the severity levels based on selected indicators computed from 1486 events, occurring at three Un-Signalized intersections in India. The proposed severity levels will help to test and evaluate various infrastructure and control improvements for making urban intersections safe for road users. It was observed from the severity levels of both the patterns that, events involving non-evasive behavior can also result in critical interaction. Overall, the research provides an advanced framework for evaluating and improving the safety of the uncontrolled intersections.}

abstract = {Observed accidents have been the main resource for road safety analysis over the past decades. Although such reliance seems quite straightforward, the rare nature of these events has made safety difficult to assess, especially for new and innovative traffic treatments. Surrogate measures of safety have allowed to step away from traditional safety performance functions and analyze safety performance without relying on accident records. In recent years, the use of extreme value theory (EV) models in combination with surrogate safety measures to estimate accident probabilities has gained popularity within the safety community. In this paper we extend existing efforts on EV for accident probability estimation for two dependent surrogate measures. Using detailed trajectory data from a driving simulator, we model the joint probability of head-on and rear-end collisions in passing maneuvers. We apply the Block Maxima method and estimate several extremal univariate and bivariate models, including the logistic copula. In our estimation we account for driver specific characteristics and road infrastructure variables. We show that accounting for these factors improve the head-on and rear-end collision probabilities estimation. This work highlights the importance of considering driver and road heterogeneity in evaluating related safety events, of relevance to interventions both for in-vehicle and infrastructure-based solutions. Such features are essential to keep up with the expectations from surrogate safety measures for the integrated analysis of accident phenomena, which show to significantly improve from the best known stationary extreme value models.}

This paper reviews the literature on the relationship between the built environment and roadway safety, with a focus on studies that analyse small geographical units, such as census tracts or travel analysis zones. We review different types of built environment measures to analyse if there are consistent relationships between such measures and crash frequency, finding that for many built environment variables there are mixed or contradictory correlations. We turn to the treatment of exposure, because built environment measures are often used, either explicitly or implicitly, as measures of exposure. We find that because exposure is often not adequately controlled for, correlations between built environment features and crash rates could be due to either higher levels of exposure or higher rates of crash risk per unit of exposure. Then, we identify various built environment variables as either more related to exposure, more related to risk, or ambiguous, and recommend further targeted research on those variables whose relationship is currently ambiguous.}

abstract = {Background
Insufficient sleep, <6.5 h per night, majorly affects shift workers, placing them at higher risk for motor vehicle crash related injury or fatality. While systematic reviews (SLRs) examine the effects of insufficient sleep and driving, to date, no SLR focuses on driver fitness or performance in shift workers.
Objectives
Determine the class of evidence (Class I-highest to Class IV-lowest), and level of confidence (Level A-high, to Level U-insufficient) in the determinants of driver fitness and performance in shift workers. Next, consider evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice, research, and policy.
Methods
A protocol was registered on PROSPERO (#CRD42018052905) using an established SLR methodology: a comprehensive electronic database search, study selection, data extraction, critical appraisal, analysis, and interpretation using published guidelines.
Results
Searches identified 1226 unique records with 11(2 on-road, 9 simulator) meeting final inclusion criteria. Class III to IV evidence identified that exposure to overnight shift work possibly predicts (Level C confidence) drivers at risk for adverse on-road outcomes and likely predicts (Level B) drivers at risk for adverse driving simulator outcomes. Higher ratings of subjective sleepiness and extended time driving possibly predict (Level C) drivers at risk for adverse driving simulator outcomes.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates a low to moderate level of confidence in the determinants of driving in shift workers. A critical need exists for gold-standard on-road assessments integrating complex driving environments representative of real-world demands, targeting tactical and strategic outcomes in a broad spectrum of shift workers.}

Unlike past studies which deal with crash frequency, this study views the crash rates directly as a continuous variable left-censored at zero and explores the application of an alternate approach based on tobit regression. To thoroughly investigate the factors affecting freeway crash rates and the potentially temporal instability in the effects of crash factors involving traffic volume, freeway geometries and pavement conditions, a classic uncorrelated random parameters tobit (URPT) model and a correlated random parameters tobit (CRPT) model were estimated, along with a conventional fixed parameters tobit (FPT) model. The analysis revealed a large number of safety factors, including several appealing and interesting factors rarely studied in the past, such as the safety effects of climbing lanes and distance along composite descending grade. The results also showed that the CRPT model was not only able to reflect the heterogeneous effects of various factors, but also able to estimate the underlying interactions among unobserved characteristics, and therefore provide better statistical fit and offer more insights into factors contributing to freeway crashes than its model counterparts. Additionally, the results showed significant temporal instability in CRPT models across the studied time periods indicating that crash factors (including unobserved characteristics and the underlying interactions among them) and their effects on crash rates varied over time, and more attentions should be paid when interpreting crash data-analysis findings and making safety policies. The modeling technique in this study demonstrates the potential of CRPT model as an effective approach to gain new insights into safety factors, particularly when the heterogeneous effects of factors on safety are interactive. Additionally, findings from this study are also expected to assist in developing more effective countermeasures by better understanding the safety effects of factors associated with freeway design characteristics and pavement conditions.}

The main objective of this study was to investigate visual search performances of both billboards and cars in patients with PD using a driving simulator. A second objective was to examine the role of cognitive functions in performing the visual search task while driving. Nineteen patients with PD (age: 68 ± 8yo, sex (Men/Women): 15/4) and 14 controls (age: 60 ± 11yo, sex: 7/7) first performed a battery of cognitive tests. They then drove in a simulator and were instructed to follow a lead vehicle while searching for billboards with the letter A (stationary target) or red cars (moving target) among other distractors. Accuracy and response times of visual search were the main outcome variables. Standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP) was the secondary outcome. During driving, patients were less accurate in identifying the targets, particularly for the stationary billboards located in the outer periphery. Within the group of patients, significant correlations were found between several measures of cognitive tests and simulator-based visual search accuracy. By contrast, only the score on the MOCA test correlated significantly with visual search accuracy in controls. Findings suggest that patients with PD have impaired visual search for more eccentric stationary targets while driving a simulator, which is likely due to cognitive deficits. Difficulties identifying objects in the outer periphery may have implications for driving safety. Decreased functional field of view under increased cognitive load may have attributed to the difficulties identifying these landmarks. This may impact the ability to identify, anticipate, and respond to important information (e.g., pedestrians, navigation signs, landmarks), especially in complex driving situations (e.g. urban driving or intersections).Future studies should be conducted in a larger sample size to determine whether a visual search task on a driving simulator may predict on-road driving performances.}

While there are currently no studies linking distraction and pedestrian crash risk, distraction has been shown to increase risky behaviours in pedestrians, for example, through reducing visual scanning before traversing an intersection. Illuminated in-ground Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) embedded into pathways are an emerging solution to address the growing distraction problem associated with mobile use while walking. The current study sought to determine if such an intervention was effective in attracting the attention of distracted pedestrians. We conducted a controlled laboratory study (N = 24) to evaluate whether pedestrians detected the activation of flashing LEDs when distracted by a smartphone more accurately and efficiently when the lights were located on the floor compared to a control position on the wall. Eye gaze movements via an eye tracker and behavioural responses via response times assessed the detection of these flashing LEDs. Distracted participants were able to detect the activation of the floor and wall-mounted LEDs with accuracies above 90%. The visual and auditory distraction tasks increased reaction times by 143 and 124 ms, respectively. Even when distracted, performance improved with floor LEDs close to participants, with reaction time improvements by 43 and 159 ms for the LEDs 2 and 1 ms away from the participant respectively. The addition of floor LED lights resulted in a performance similar to the one observed for wall-mounted LEDs in the non-distracted condition. Moreover, participants did not necessarily need to fixate on the LEDs to detect their activation, thus were likely to have detected them using their peripheral vision. The findings suggest that LEDs embedded in pathways are likely to be effective at attracting the attention of distracted pedestrians. Further research needs to be conducted in the field to confirm these findings, and to evaluate the actual effects on behaviour under real-world conditions.}

For this reason, this paper aims to investigate which are the patterns among crash characteristics contributing to PTW crashes in Spain. Data from 78,611 crashes involving PTWs occurred in Spain in the period 2011–2013 were analyzed. The analysis was performed by using classification trees and rules discovery which are suitable models aimed at extracting knowledge and identifying valid and understandable patterns from large amounts of data previously unknown and indistinguishable. The response variables assessed in this study were severity and crash type. As a result, several combinations of road, environmental and drivers’ characteristics associated with severity and typology of PTW crashes in Spain were identified. Based on the analysis results, several countermeasures to solve or mitigate the safety issues identified in the study were proposed. From the methodological point of view, study results show that both the classification trees and the a priori algorithm were effective in providing non-trivial and unsuspected relations in the data. Classification trees structure allowed a simpler understanding of the phenomenon under study while association discovery provided new information which was previously hidden in the data. Given that the results of the two different techniques were never contradictory, we recommend using classification trees and association discovery as complementary approaches since their combination is effective in exploring data providing meaningful insights about PTW crash characteristics and their interdependencies.}

abstract = {Introduction
Mindful organizing (also known as collective mindfulness) is a team level construct that is said to underpin the principles of high-reliability organizations (HROs), as it has shown to lead to almost error-free performance. While mindful organizing research has proliferated in recent years, studies on how to measure mindful organizing are scarce. Vogus and Sutcliffe (2007) originally validated a nine-item “Mindful Organizing Scale” but few subsequent validation studies of this scale exist. The present study aimed to validate a Spanish version of the Mindful Organizing Scale.
Method
The sample included 47 teams (comprising of a total of 573 workers with an average team size of 12.19) from a Spanish nuclear power plant. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), reliability analysis, and an analysis of aggregation indices were carried out. A correlation analysis and CFA were used to further validate the scale in terms of its distinctiveness from, and relationship with, other team-related variables such as safety culture, team safety climate, and team learning. Finally, evidence of criterion-related validity was collected by testing the incremental validity of the mindful organizing scale in the association with various workplace safety outcomes (safety compliance and safety participation).
Results
The results confirmed a unidimensional structure of the scale and indicated satisfactory internal consistency. Aggregation of the scores to the team level was justified while significant positive correlations between mindful organizing and other team-related variables (safety culture, team safety climate, team learning) were found. Moreover, mindful organizing showed distinctiveness from safety culture, team safety climate and team learning. Finally, incremental validity of the scale was supported, as it shows to be associated with safety compliance and safety participation above and beyond other related constructs.
Conclusions
The Spanish version of the Mindful Organizing Scale has shown to be a valid and reliable scale that can be used to measure mindful organizing.
Contributions
The validation of the unidimensional Spanish version of Vogus and Sutcliffe’s (2007) Mindful Organizing Scale provides researchers and practitioners with a reliable and valid tool to use in Spanish speaking organizations to measure mindful organizing, which has been shown to result in more reliable performance. Theoretically, this study offers four contributions. Firstly, it validates a scale that operationalizes the ‘mindful organizing’ construct in a traditional high-reliability organization (nuclear power plant) which has never been done before. Secondly, it offers evidence that a mindful organizing scale can be validated in a new cultural context and language (Spanish) to any of the previous studies done before it. Thirdly, it adds to our understanding of mindful organizing’s nomological network by distinguishing it from other team and safety-related variables. Lastly, it builds on current research showing sound psychometric properties of a one-dimensional, quantitative measure of mindful organizing.}

Although vision has received a bulk of the attention in research on pedestrian safety, the examination of both vision and audition are important to consider. Environmental, intrapersonal, and cognitive qualities of a pedestrian context may limit the use of one or both perceptual modalities. Across two experiments, we examined the impact of perceptual constraints on pedestrian safety by measuring the accuracy of vehicle time-to-arrival estimates in a virtual environment when vehicles were only visible, only audible, or both visible and audible. In both experiments, participants estimated the time-to-arrival of vehicles moving at one of two speeds (8-kph, 40-kph). In the second experiment, we introduced ambient traffic noises to examine the impact of environmentally relevant traffic noises on pedestrian perception. Results suggest seeing a vehicle is more advantageous than hearing a vehicle when interacting with traffic, especially in the presence of ambient sound. Both experiments resulted in more accurate time-to-arrival estimates in the visual and mixed conditions than in the auditory-only condition. Implications for pedestrian safety and future research are discussed.}

However, driving during non-hypoglycemia may also bring certain safety hazards for some patients with diabetes. Based on previous studies on diabetes-related to early aging effect, as well as gender differences in health belief and driving behavior, we have hypothesized that middle-aged male drivers with type 2 diabetes, compared with the control healthy ones, may experience a decline in driving performance without awareness. And the decline is caused by impaired perceptual and cognitive driving-related functions. To verify these hypotheses, we recruited 56 non-professional male drivers aged between 40 and 60 (27 patients with type 2 diabetes and 29 healthy controls) to perform a simulated car-following task and finish behavioral tests of proprioception, visual search, and working memory abilities during non-hypoglycemia. They also reported their hypoglycemia experience and perceived driving skills. We found that the patients had equal confidence in their driving skills but worse driving performance as shown in larger centerline deviation (t = 2.83, p = .006), longer brake reaction time (t = 3.77, p = .001) and shorter minimum time-to-collision (t = -3.27, p = .002). Such between-group differences in driving performance could be fully mediated by proprioception, visual search ability, and working memory capacity but not by hypoglycemia experience. Regarding the effect sizes of the mediation, the visual search ability played the most important role, and then followed the working memory and the proprioception. This initial study provides original and first-hand evidence demonstrating that the middle-aged male drivers with type 2 diabetes have deteriorated driving performance, but they are unaware of it. We will also discuss the possible measures to identify people of the highest risk and improve their safety awareness by using the findings of the current study.}

Consistent with the trend in period effects, RTI mortality increased sharply with the economic growth in the 1980s, decelerated after the implementation of road safety policies in the early 1990s, plummeted owing to the 1997–1998 financial crisis, and gradually decreased from the early 2000s. A J-shaped age effect indicated that the relative risk of road traffic death surged in people aged ≥65 years. Educational expansion from the mid-1950s turned an increasing birth cohort effect into a continuously decreasing trend after peaking around the 1938–1943 birth cohorts. The risk of road traffic death was relatively high among the Korean Generation Y, i.e., those born in 1978–1983. RTI mortality trends in Korea have been affected by diverse socioeconomic changes through cohort and period effects. Despite the recent favorable trend, RTI mortality remains high, especially among older people. Road safety policies to address the burden of RTIs require further improvement.}

abstract = {Though U.S. motor vehicle crashes as a whole have decreased over the past few years, fatalities among vulnerable road users have increased. Pedestrian deaths rose nationally by 27% between 2007 and 2016 accounting for 16% of all motor vehicle fatalities. This increase continues to burden transportation specialists, public health professionals, and community stakeholders. Potential risk factors include characteristics of the built environment, distractions, and pedestrians’ use of alcohol and drugs. Pedestrian deaths in Georgia, United States, increased 40% between 2014 and 2016 while drug overdose deaths have increased by 18% during the same period. Concurrent increases in mortality due to pedestrian fatalities and drug overdoses make Georgia a natural environment in which to describe the proximity of drugs among pedestrian fatalities, a topic largely overlooked by the literature. This study explores the epidemiology of pedestrian fatalities in Georgia over a 10-year period with an emphasis on reported substance use among cases. The study employed 10-year data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Descriptive methods were used to explore drug screens by person, place, and time. We also examined trends in total drug screens over the examination period. Between 2007 and 2016, 1781 pedestrian crashes were reported to FARS; the fatality rate for this period was 94.5%. Of these, most were male with Blacks and Whites equally represented. Ages 15–64 accounted for 81.1% of cases with most occurring in the Atlanta Metropolitan area. When adjusted for population, one finds higher rates in more rural areas of the state. Data revealed that testing for the presence of drugs occurred among half of reported cases. Of those testing positive, five drug categories emerged; stimulants (45.8%), cannabinoids (21.5%), narcotics (including opioids) (14.1%), depressants (12.1%), and “Other Drugs” (6.3%). Positive drug screens across all drug classifications increased by 178.1% between 2007 and 2016. These findings suggest the need for state-wide policies designed to promote more consistent screening among pedestrians involved in motor vehicle crashes as well as diligence in understanding the role played by drugs among this population. Additional investigation should be conducted to tease out the presence of category-specific drugs among pedestrians. Understanding the epidemiology of pedestrian fatalities in the state, especially in relation to substance use, serves as a first step toward implementing localized preventive efforts.}

Driving/riding under the influence (DUI) of alcohol is a major public concern worldwide. Only a few studies have distinguished DUI-related variables between motorcyclists and car drivers. This study examined the differences in demographic characteristics and drinking behaviors among first-time DUI offenders operating different transportation vehicles, and risk factors for frequent DUI (fDUI) among them.
Methods
We conducted an anonymous survey for 561 first-time DUI offenders who attended a mandatory educational program. Participants self-administered questionnaires concerning alcohol drinking behaviors and DUI. We defined fDUI as at least two DUI behaviors per month based on self-reported information. Demographic and drinking characteristics were compared between DUI offenders, car drivers and motorcyclists. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine risk factors for fDUI.
Results
Two-thirds of first-time DUI offenders were motorcyclists. Compared with car drivers, motorcyclists were younger and less educated, with a higher percentage of them being women and unmarried. Car drivers reported a higher rate of fDUI than motorcyclists (16.5% vs. 9.7%). Regression analysis revealed that binge drinkers had a higher fDUI risk in both groups. Regarding the drinking place prior to DUI behavior, workplace was significantly associated with fDUI in car drivers.
Conclusions
Distinct strategies may be required for motorcyclists and car drivers for DUI recidivism prevention, and drinking place interventions should also be considered.}

Unless the missing data are resulted randomly, the popular naive estimation may not provide reliable results for policy making. In contrast, the implementation of the Horvitz method, which inversely weights the observed data by a weight that are obtained parametrically or nonparametrically, results in reliable estimators. We received satisfactory results on the performance of our approach handling the missing data problems in both a Monte Carlo simulation and a real traffic accident data exploration.}

Behavioral adaptation can improve safety, but it can also reduce or even eliminate anticipated safety benefits of many well-intentioned road safety countermeasures. To expect driver behavior to remain the same after the implementation of a change in the road, vehicle, or driving environment, is naïve. Empirical studies that do not consider the full range of behavior affected by a countermeasure may similarly overlook the consequences of behavioral adaptation. This paper considers a number of examples of driver safety countermeasure implementation where unexpected results occurred and behavioral adaptation was the likely culprit. These examples are drawn from highway design, traffic control device design, vehicle countermeasures, enforcement countermeasures, driver education countermeasures and impaired driving policies. A previously presented inventory of characteristics to consider when estimating the likelihood for behavioral adaptation (Rudin-Brown et al., 2013) is expanded and presented within the context of the Qualitative Model of Behavioral Adaptation (Rudin-Brown \& Noy, 2002; Rudin-Brown, 2010), in the hopes of addressing the question “When can we anticipate the safety effect of a treatment, and when not?”}

This study assessed the efficacy of a pre-drive ocular assessment for predicting sleep-related impairment in naturalistic driving, in rotating shift workers. Fifteen healthcare workers drove an instrumented vehicle for 2 weeks, while working a combination of day, evening and night shifts. The vehicle monitored lane departures and behavioural microsleeps (blinks >500 ms) during the drive. Immediately prior to driving, ocular parameters were assessed with a 4-min test. Lane departures and behavioural microsleeps occurred on 17.5 % and 10 % of drives that had pre-drive assessments, respectively. Pre-drive blink duration significantly predicted behavioural microsleeps and showed promise for predicting lane departures (AUC = 0.79 and 0.74). Pre-drive percentage of time with eyes closed had high accuracy for predicting lane departures and behavioural microsleeps (AUC = 0.73 and 0.96), although was not statistically significant. Pre-drive psychomotor vigilance task variables were not statistically significant predictors of lane departures. Self-reported sleep-related and hazardous driving events were significantly predicted by mean blink duration (AUC = 0.65 and 0.69). Measurement of ocular parameters pre-drive predict drowsy driving during naturalistic driving, demonstrating potential for fitness-to-drive assessment in operational environments.}

abstract = {Context and objective
Among the different products and protective gear used by riders of two-wheeled motorized vehicles, back protectors that are designed to prevent damage to the spinal column are widely used today compared other protections. However, few studies measure their effectiveness. Can their effectiveness be measured? How do they help decrease or change the nature of thoracolumbar traumas that occur? To address these questions and remedy the lack of objective data regarding these products, an epidemiological, clinical, and biomechanical analysis of motorcycle riders who were admitted to a French trauma center after an accident was performed. So, this study investigates the effectiveness of back protectors, including their ability to prevent specific mechanisms of thoracic and lumbar spinal injuries related to TWMV accidents.
Method
A questionnaire was administered to victims of accidents involving two-wheeled motorized vehicles who were admitted to the trauma room at the Marseille trauma center over the course of 2016. Collect data are related to the victim, the accident scenario, and a detailed description of the observed injuries using AIS (Abbreviated Injury Scale) coding and Magerl classification. Univariate analyses and Fisher tests were performed for victims who were or were not wearing back protectors.
Results
This study collected data from 124 victims. Almost half of the victims were wearing a back protector at the time of the accident (53 victims, thus 43% of riders). Collectively, twenty-nine victims who were wearing back protectors had 57 thoracolumbar injuries, and twenty eight victims who were not wearing back protectors had 75 thoracolumbar lesions. The results from this study show that there is no significant difference in the nature and mechanism of thoracolumbar injuries as a function of back protection. The majority of the thoracolumbar injuries were not severe. They were primarily bone injuries, essentially compression fractures, regardless of whether a back protector was worn.
Conclusion
This study shows that the use of back protection does not decrease the number, type, or mechanism of thoracolumbar injuries associated with accidents involving two-wheeled motorized vehicles. However, it suggests that lumbar vertebral injuries are deflected towards the thoracic vertebrae when back protectors are worn. Finally, it suggests that the design of back protectors should be reconsidered to better protect riders from what are referred to as compression fractures (craniocaudal force), which remain the primary form of fracture regardless of the rider’s characteristics, based on the data analyzed.}

This paper presents an effort to investigate the contributing factors to large truck rollover crashes. Specific focus was placed on exploring the role of heterogeneity and the potential sources of heterogeneity regarding their impacts on injury-severity outcomes. The data used in this study contained large truck rollover crashes that occurred between 2007 and 2016 in the state of Florida. A random parameter ordered logit (RPOL) model was applied. Various driver, vehicle, roadway, and crash attributes were explored as potential predictors in the model. Their impacts were examined for the presence of heterogeneity. Interaction effects were then added to the random variables in order to detect potential sources of heterogeneity. Model results showed that the impacts of lighting conditions and driving speed had significant variation across observations, and this variation could be attributed to driver actions and driver conditions at the time of the crash, as well as driver vision obstruction. Findings from this study shed light on the direction, magnitude, and randomness of the factors that contribute to large truck rollover crashes. Findings associated with heterogeneity could help develop more effective and targeted countermeasures to improve freight safety. Driver education programs could be planned more efficiently, and advisory and warning signs could be designed in a more insightful manner by taking into account specific roadway attributes, such as sandy surfaces, downhill, curved alignment, unpaved shoulders, and lighting conditions.}

A classical police work dealing with a simulated traffic accident was compared to sketches obtained from 3D models from Riegl VZ-400i 3D, Faro Focus S70, Geoslam ZebRevo 3D TLS and Topcon Falcon 8 drone. For 3D modelling an orthophoto from drone photos and point clouds were obtained. 3D models were graphically compared in CloudCompare software. Sketches were made for each measuring method and their accuracies were also compared one to each other. The graphical distance accuracy in scene measurements ranged up to 17 cm in comparison to police measurement but in the most course point cloud. Average absolute difference in compared distances amounts up to 6 cm. As expected, more points in the cloud means better 3D model and easier analysis. There is considerable reduction of time needed for collecting the accident scene data. The obtained 3D model is a permanent archive of the scene of a traffic accident. From the cadre, both visual and dimensional information subsequently can be obtained.}

Overlapping was excluded and absence of false positives was confirmed. Articles on alcohol with/without other psychoactive substances were assessed quantitatively (bibliometric measures). Well identified by All Science Journal Classification system (ASJC) (Elsevier Scopus), an increase in the number of articles through the 6 decades analyzed was observed, from 152 (1956–1965) to 2302 (2006–2015), which represent an average decadal growth rate (ADGR) of 72.21. Among 89 countries, United States of America published 37.62 % out of all the included articles. Nevertheless, institutions from Canada, European Union and Australia published 50 articles or more during 60 years. The publications were mostly welcomed by journals on substance abuse research, and an exponential increase in publications on combined use of alcohol and other driving-impairing substances was observed since the second half of the eighties. This is the first study that attempted an analysis of scientific production of macro- and meso-actors on a topic belonging to an intricate research area. Bibliometric analyses should be considered as an important tool for updating the evidence on the serious problem of driving under the influence (DUI). The awareness of policy makers and the other relevant actors involved in the control of DUI of alcohol and other substances is stressed.}

Predicting the impacts of lane change can help to develop optimal lane change strategies of autonomous vehicles for safety improvement. The study aims at proposing a machine learning method for the short-term prediction of lane-changing impacts (LCI) during the propagation of traffic oscillations. The empirical lane-changing trajectory records were obtained from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) platform. A support vector regression (SVR) model was trained in this study to predict the LCI on the crash risks and flow change using microscopic traffic variables such as individual speed, gap and acceleration on both original lanes and target lanes. Sensitivity analyses were conducted in the SVR to quantify the contributions of correlative lane changing factors. The results showed that the trained SVR model achieved an accuracy of 72.81 % for the risk of crashes and 95.34 % in predicting the flow change. The sensitivity analysis explored the optimal speed and acceleration for the lane changer to achieve the lowest time integrated time-to-collision (TIT) value for safety maximization. Finally, we compared the LCI for motorcycles, automobiles and trucks as well as the LCI for both lane-changing directions (from left to right and from right to left). It was found that motorcycles conducted lane changes with smaller gaps and larger speed differences, which brings the highest crash risks. Passenger cars were found to be the safest when they conduct lane changes. Lane changes to the right had more negative impacts on traffic flow and crash risks.}

This paper discusses whether the use of road safety measures on national roads in Norway can be interpreted as an informal application of the ALARP-principle. According to official guidelines, priority setting for major road investments should be based on cost-benefit analysis. Most road safety measures are low-cost projects that have traditionally not been subject to cost-benefit analysis. A use of these measures regarded as reasonable in the ALARP sense may include considerations of cost, efficiency and fair distribution. Data on 328 road safety measures implemented around 2000 is used to evaluate factors influencing their use. It is argued that the use of these measures is consistent with an informal application of the ALARP-principle.}

Previous jam-absorption driving strategies focused on the operational side and did not consider the safety effects caused by the controlled vehicle on freeways. In this paper, we proposed an optimal jam-absorption driving strategy to mitigate traffic oscillations and rear-end collision risks on freeway straight segments. Firstly, the proposed strategy determined the starting and ending point of an oscillation at the temporal and spatial dimensions based on the Wavelet Transform (WT) and the steady equilibrium condition of car-following driving. Then different controlled vehicles were evaluated by the given absorbing speeds. Various measurements were considered to evaluate the safety performance of the strategies. The optimal solution was obtained which guided the controlled vehicle to move slowly at the optimal jam-absorbing speed, and created a gap to eliminate the downstream oscillation timely but avoid causing secondary wave in the upstream traffic. The Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) was modified to build the simulation platform in a connected environment. The results showed that our proposed strategy effectively reduced the severity of traffic oscillations, or even fully eliminate the oscillations. The optimal strategy reduced the surrogate safety measures by 93.53 %–94.78 %, and decreased the total travel time by 1.27 %. We also compared our strategy with previous strategies and the results suggested that ours had better performances.}

abstract = {Speeding has been a great concern around the world due to the occurrence and severity of road crashes. This paper presents an evaluation of the effectiveness of different penalty and camera-based enforcement strategies in curbing speeding offences by professional drivers in Hong Kong. A stated preference survey approach is employed to measure the association between penalty and enforcement strategies and drivers’ speed choices. Data suggest that almost all drivers comply with speed limits when they reach a camera housing section of the road. For other road sections, a panel mixed logit model is estimated and applied to understand the effectiveness of penalties and enforcement strategies on driver’s speeding behaviors. Driving-offence points (DOPs) are found to be more effective than monetary fines in deterring speeding offences, albeit there is significant heterogeneity in how drivers respond to these strategies. Warning drivers of an upcoming camera-based enforcement section increased speed compliance. Several demographic and employment characteristics, driving history and perception variables also influence drivers’ choices of speed compliance. Finally, besides penalty and enforcement strategies, driver education and training programs aimed at addressing aggressiveness/risk-taking traits might help reduce repeated speeding offences among drivers.}

This study aims to investigate the contributing factors that affect the injury severity of head-on crashes and develop appropriate countermeasures. Due to the unobserved heterogeneity inherent in the crash data, a latent class clustering analysis is firstly conducted to segment the head-on crashes into relatively homogeneous clusters. Then, mixed logit models are developed to further explore the unobserved heterogeneity within each cluster. Analyses are performed based on the data collected from the Highway Safety Information System (HSIS) from 2005 to 2013 in North Carolina. The estimated parameters and associated marginal effects are combined to interpret significant variables of the developed models. The proposed method is able to uncover the heterogeneity within the whole dataset and the homogeneous clusters. Results of this research can provide more reliable and insightful information to engineers and policy makers regarding the contributing factors to head-on crashes.}

In case of predictive accuracy based on in-sample errors (posterior deviance), the Mixture-5 demonstrated superior performance in majority of the cases, indicating the advantage of mixture approach to accurately predict crash counts. LPML (log pseudo marginal likelihood) was also calculated as a cross-validation measure based on out-of-sample errors and this criterion also established the dominance of Mixture-5, further reinforcing the superiority of the mixture approach from different perspectives. The site ranking evaluation results demonstrated the advantages of adopting the mixture approach. In terms of total rank difference (TRD) results, there were several discrepancies between the two approaches, suggesting that two approaches designate unsafe sites differently. Another site ranking criterion, site consistency test (SCT), was employed to explore the difference in identification of unsafe sites based on two datasets: estimated crash count (traditional) and the spatial variability across time. The advantage of mixture models to act as a complimentary approach for site ranking was revealed by the spatial variability SCT results. The method consistency test (MCT) results also indicate the advantages of mixture models over the Base one. These findings suggested that mixture approach may prove helpful in the network screening step of safety management process to identify sites which may turn unsafe in the future and escape the detection from traditional methods.}

from probability theory and probabilistic random walk, predictions about the quantity of cases of a given phenomenon for certain year, such as epidemics of dengue, have been previously obtained with results close to 100% in precision.
Objective
To confirm the applicability of a methodology based on probability and probabilistic random walk to predict the dynamics of deaths from road traffic injuries in Colombia for 2010.
Methodology
through the development of a total probability space that analyses the probabilistic behaviour of augments and decreases observed in the variation of the lengths of the death rates caused by traffic in Colombia from 2004 to 2009, the most likely event for 2010 was established for predicting the rate of deaths for that year.
Results
The predicted rate of deaths caused by traffic injuries in Colombia for 2010 was 14.88 with the methodology. When this value is compared with the value reported by national statistics, which was a rate of 12.9, a precision of 86.6% with the prediction was achieved.
Conclusions
the applicability of the developed methodology to predict the dynamic behaviour of deaths caused by traffic injuries in Colombia for 2010 by means of a probabilistic random walk was confirmed with a good precision, suggesting that this methodology could be useful to verify the efficacy of national road safety strategies implemented to reduce mortality rates.}

However very little research has been conducted into interventions to combat such an issue. Existing interventions such as police enforcement and legislation appear to have limited effect. The use of mobile phone applications to assist in limiting driver distraction is an alternative intervention that is currently gaining traction. With a great array of potential benefits, such as reducing road toll, these applications can be readily available to all road users. Despite the positive implications, it is vital that drivers accept the use of such a technology for the intervention to be effective. Therefore, understanding driver acceptance is an important step in implanting such applications. To assess this, the present study examines the utility of two versions of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) for understanding the acceptance of technology designed to reduce distraction. Participants were presented with two different applications and responded to questions that indicated their attitudes towards the factors included in the TAM, TPB and UTAUT, alongside their intent to use the technology. A total of 731 participants responded to the survey, and their responses analysed. The results indicated that overall, Davis’ (1985) TAM was slightly better in explaining behavioural intent for both Mobile Phone Application (MPA) 1 and MPA 2, explaining 66.1% and 68.7% of the variance, respectively. Davis’ (1989) TAM and the TPB were close behind, while the UTAUT explained the least variance in behavioural intent of all the models. Overall, the findings of this study provide support for using psychological theories to assess the acceptance of mobile phone applications.}

This allows us to map fatality and injury rates in Spanish provinces depending on their level of economic development. Provinces were divided in two large groups according to the mean weight of their per capita GDP on the national GDP from 2000 to 2015. Using fixed effects data panel models, estimations were obtained for each group of the impact of the relationships between per capita GDP, unemployment rate and other control variables on their risks of fatality and injury. The models reveal that economic conditions and education are explanatory factors with greater significance and impact on the risks of fatality and injury in provinces with higher levels of economic development. In this group, the penalty-points driving licence was found have a greater impact, although its effectiveness is now being questioned. In contrast, to reduce the risks of fatality and injury in less developed provinces, it is imperative to invest in road infrastructure, increasing the proportion of high capacity roads and investing more in road replacement and maintenance. The geographical distribution generated in this study allows us to better identify the areas with a higher risk of fatality or injury. This, in turn, confirms the need to improve the configuration of road safety policy, taking into account the different fatality or injury rates across provinces, the origins of which lie in the specific provincial conditions.}

This new method has been widely used to define the colocation pattern of categorized data in various fields, but it has not yet been applied to crash severity data. According to our findings, (1) crashes tended to be at the same injury level as those of neighboring ones, which was most significant for fatal crashes and second most significant for non-injury crashes; (2) the colocation quotient matrix tended to be symmetrical in non-injury crashes versus injury crashes (minor injury, major injury, and fatal); and, (3) DWIs (driving while intoxicated) and hit-and runs did not show a strong pattern. These colocation quotient results could be helpful for predicting crash severity and by providing traffic engineers with more effective traffic safety measures.}

Prediction of crash risk is vital for avoiding secondary crashes and safeguarding highway traffic. For many years, researchers have explored several techniques for early and precise detection of crashes to aid in traffic incident management. With recent advancements in data collection techniques, abundant real-time traffic data is available for use. Big data infrastructure and machine learning algorithms can utilize this data to provide suitable solutions for the highway traffic safety system. This paper explores the feasibility of using deep learning models to detect crash occurrence and predict crash risk. Volume, Speed and Sensor Occupancy data collected from roadside radar sensors along Interstate 235 in Des Moines, IA is used for this study. This real-world traffic data is used to design feature set for the deep learning models for crash detection and crash risk prediction. The results show that a deep model has better crash detection performance and similar crash prediction performance than state of the art shallow models. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted for crash risk prediction using data 1-minute, 5-minutes and 10-minutes prior to crash occurrence. It was observed that is hard to predict the crash risk of a traffic condition, 10 min prior to a crash.}

To provide insights into the contributing factors of AV crashes, this study created a unique database from the California Department of Motor Vehicles 124 manufacturer-reported Traffic Collision Reports and was linked with detailed data on roadway and built-environment attributes. A novel text analysis was first conducted to extract useful information from crash report narratives. Of the crashes that could be geocoded (N = 113), results indicate the most frequent AV crash type was rear-end collisions (61.1%; N = 69) and 13.3% (N = 15) were injury crashes. These noteworthy outcomes and a small sample size motivated us to rigorously analyze rear-end and injury crashes in a Full Bayesian empirical setup. Owing to the potential issue of unobserved heterogeneity, hierarchical-Bayes fixed and random parameter logit models are estimated. Results reveal that when the automated driving system is engaged and remains engaged, the likelihood of an AV-involved rear-end crash is substantially higher compared to a conventionally-driven AV or when the driver disengages the automated driving system prior to a crash. Given the AV-involved crashes, the likelihood of an AV-involved rear-end crash was significantly higher in mixed land-use settings compared to other land-use types, and was significantly lower near public/private schools. Correlations of other roadway attributes and environmental factors with AV-involved rear-end and injury crash propensities are discussed. This study aids in understanding the interactions of AVs and human-driven conventional vehicles in complex urban environments.}

Collisions with cervids are known to be influenced by spatial factors such as topography and forest cover. However, temporal changes in animal and motorist behaviors are often overlooked although they can increase the odds of cervid-vehicle collisions. Consequently, we evaluated potential factors influencing the spatiotemporal distribution of 450 collisions with moose and white-tailed deer that occurred between 1990 and 2015 along the 100-km long highway in southeastern Québec, Canada. Both spatial and temporal factors efficiently explained moose-vehicle collisions but not collisions with white-tailed deer, suggesting that the latter occurred more randomly along the highway. The risk of moose-vehicle collisions was mainly modulated by topographic and habitat variables, as the interactions between slope and elevation and slope and distance to suitable moose habitats had a strong effect on collision risk. Road sinuosity and the proportion of mature coniferous stands around the collision site positively influenced deer-vehicle collisions. A temporal increase in collision numbers was noted in different biological periods during which movement rates are known to be higher (e.g. post-winter dispersal and rut). These results suggest that cervid movement is the main factor influencing collision risk and frequency. Our results indicate that mitigation strategies aimed at decreasing the probability of collision with cervids must be species-specific and should focus more closely on animal movement.}

Counter to this belief, and in line with age-related resource selectivity theory, we hypothesized that older workers would actually be less likely than younger workers to speak up about workplace safety concerns (“safety voice intentions”) when their supervisors are unclear about their own commitment to safety. To test this, we created two realistic scenarios in which we manipulated clarity of supervisor commitment to safety: (1) it is clear the supervisor clearly cares about/is open to hearing suggestions about safety (the “clear commitment” condition) and (2) it is unclear whether the supervisor cares about/is open to hearing suggestions about safety (the “unclear commitment” condition). We randomly assigned participants (N = 80; 58 % women; 40 % over the age of 24) to one of the two scenarios and measured their safety voice intentions. In the face of clear supervisor commitment to safety, younger and adult workers did not differ on their safety voice intentions. However, compared to younger workers, adult workers were less likely to speak up about safety in the face of unclear signals about the supervisor’s commitment to safety. These findings have implications for our understanding of young and adult worker safety voice, and the importance of how supervisors signal commitment to safety.}

This model can explicitly learn from the various features, such as traffic flow characteristics, signal timing, and weather conditions. Specifically, LSTM captures the long-term dependency while CNN extracts the time-invariant features. The synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) is used for resampling the training dataset. Five common models are developed to compare the results with the proposed model, such as the XGBoost, Bayesian Logistics Regression, LSTM, etc. Experiments suggest that the proposed model outperforms others in terms of Area Under the Curve (AUC) value, sensitivity, and false alarm rate.

abstract = {Background
Cycling, as a mode of active transportation, has numerous health and societal benefits, but carries risks of injury when performed on-road with vehicles. Cycle tracks are dedicated lanes with a physical separation or barrier between bicycles and motor vehicles. Studies on the effectiveness of cycle tracks in urban areas in North America, as well as the area-wide effects of cycle tracks are limited.
Aims
Study objectives were to examine the effect of cycle track implementation on cyclist-motor vehicle collisions (CMVC) occurring: (1) on streets treated with new cycle tracks; (2) on streets surrounding new cycle tracks in Toronto, Canada.
Methods
Intervention and outcome data were obtained from the City of Toronto. All police-reported CMVC from 2000 to 2016 were mapped. Analyses were restricted to 2 years pre- and 2 years post-track implementation. Rates were calculated for CMVC on streets with cycle tracks (objective 1) and in five defined areas surrounding cycle tracks (objective 2). Zero-Inflated Poisson regression was used to compare changes to CMVC rates before and after cycle track implementation for both objectives. All models controlled for season of collision and cycle track.
Results
The majority of CMVC on cycle tracks occurred at intersections (75%). The crude CMVC rate increased two-fold after cycle track implementation (IRR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.51–2.81); however, after accounting for the increase in cycling volumes post-implementation, there was a 38% reduction in the CMVC rate per cyclist-month (IRR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.44–0.89). On streets between 151 m – 550 m from cycle tracks, there was a significant 35% reduction in CMVC rates per km-month following track implementation (IRR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.54–0.76).
Conclusions
Cycle track implementation was associated with increased safety for cyclists on cycle tracks, after adjusting for cycling volume. In addition, there was a significant reduction in CMVC on streets surrounding cycle tracks between 151 m – 550 m distance from the tracks (a ‘safety halo’ effect), suggesting an area-wide safety effect of cycle track implementation.}

abstract = {Road traffic accidents have decreased in most developed nations over the last decade. This has been attributed to improvements in vehicle and road design, medical technology and care, and driver education and training. Recent evidence however indicates that fuel price changes also have a significant impact on road traffic accidents through other mediating factors such as reductions in driver exposure through less car travel and more fuel-efficient driving e.g. speed reduction on high-speed roads. So far though, no study has examined the effects of changing fuel prices on road traffic accidents in a country such as Great Britain where fuel prices are kept artificially high for public policy reasons. Consequently, this study was designed to quantify the effects of fuel price on road traffic accident frequency through changes and adjustments in travel behaviour. For this purpose, weekly fuel prices (between 2005–2015) have been used to study the effects on road traffic accidents using the Prais-Winsten model of first order autoregressive (AR1) and the Box and Jenkins seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average models (SARIMA). The study found that with every 1% increase in fuel price there is a 0.4% reduction in the number of fatal road traffic accidents. In light of this, one concern raised was that recent UK government plans to phase out petrol and diesel vehicles by 2040 may also risk a rise in fatal road traffic accidents, and hence this will need to be addressed.}

abstract = {Attributions of fault are often associated with worse injury outcomes; however, the consistency and magnitude of these impacts is not known. This review examined the prognostic role of fault on health, mental health, pain and work outcomes after transport injury. A systematic search of five electronic databases (Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library) yielded 16,324 records published between 2000 and January 2018. Eligibility criteria were: adult transport injury survivors; prospective design; multivariable analysis; fault-related factor analysed; pain, mental health, general health or work-related outcome. Citations (n = 10,558, excluding duplicates) and full text articles (n = 555) were screened manually (Reviewer 1), and using concurrent machine learning and text mining (Reviewer 2; using Abstrackr, WordStat and QDA miner). Data from 55 papers that met all inclusion criteria were extracted, papers were evaluated for risk of bias using the QUIPS tool, and overall level of evidence was assessed using the GRADE tool. There were six main fault-related factors classified as: fault or responsibility, fault-based compensation, lawyer involvement or litigation, blame or guilt, road user or position in vehicle, and impact direction. Overall there were inconsistent associations between fault and transport injury outcomes, and 60% of papers had high risk of bias. There was moderate evidence that fault-based compensation claims were associated with poorer health-related outcomes, and that lawyer involvement was associated with poorer work outcomes beyond 12 months post-injury. However, the evidence of negative associations between fault-based compensation claims and work-related outcomes was limited. Lawyer involvement and fault-based compensation claims were associated with adverse mental health outcomes six months post-injury, but not beyond 12 months. The most consistent associations between fault and negative outcomes were not for fault attributions, per se, but were related to fault-related procedures (e.g., lawyer engagement, fault-based compensation claims).}

This study develops the logistic regression (LR) model and five typical non-parametric models including, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees (DT), and Random Forest (RF) to examine the relationship between influencing factors and vehicle collision risk. Based on the vehicle trajectory data extracted from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) videos using an automated video analysis system, the unconstrained vehicle motion’s collision risk can be evaluated by the extended time to collision (ETTC). Results of model performance comparison indicate that not all non-parametric models have a better prediction performance than the LR model. Specifically, the KNN, SVM, DT and RF models have better model performance than LR model in model training, while the ANN model has the worst model performance. In model prediction, the accuracy of LR model is higher than that of other five non-parametric models under various ETTC thresholds conditions. The LR model implies a pretty good performance and its results also indicate that vehicle yields the higher collision risk when it drives on the left side of toll plaza diverging area and more dangerous situations could be found for an ETC vehicle. Moreover, the vehicle collision risks are positively associated with the speed of the following vehicle and the angle between the leading vehicle speed vector and X axis. Furthermore, the results of DT model show that three factors play important roles in classifying vehicle collision risk and the effects of them on collision risk are consistent with the results of LR model. These findings provide valuable information for accurate assessment of collision risk, which is a key step toward improving safety performance of the toll plaza diverging area.}

abstract = {Objective
We studied which current fatal at-fault crashes would occur despite the most advanced current active safety devices (up to SAE level 2 of driving automation) and how frequent these crashes would be.
Methods
We carried out a cross-sectional study of passenger cars that were first registered during the period 1st January 2010 to 31st December 2017 in Finland. To gain the true exposure for these cars, we accessed the national Vehicular and Driver Data Register to obtain the mileage information and the registration count for the study period of 2010-17. Similarly, we accessed the registry of Finnish road accident investigation teams and included all fatal at-fault crashes among the cars in our study for the same period. We used a real world reference technology for each active safety system in our analysis and chose one car brand as an example. This gave us exact system specifications and enabled testing the operation of the systems on the road. We performed field tests to gain further information on the precise operation of the safety systems in different operating conditions. Finally, we gathered all information on the studied active safety systems and analyzed the investigated at-fault fatal crashes case-by-case using our four level method.
Results
Cars in our study were the primary party in 113 investigated fatal accidents during the years 2010-17. In 87 of the accidents, the leading cause of death was the injuries due to the crash, and these cases were classified as “unavoidable” (n = 58, 67 %), “avoidable” (n = 26, 30 %) or unsolved (n = 3, 3 %). Of the 58 “unavoidable” crashes 21 (36 %) were suicides, 21 (36%) involved active driver input which would have prevented the safety system operation, 15 (17 %) featured circumstances beyond the safety system performance and in one loss-of-control crash the driver had disabled the relevant safety system (electronic stability control). The registration years of the cars in our study (2010-17) totaled 3,772,864 and during this period, the cars travelled 75.9 billion kilometers. The crash incidence of the “unavoidable” at-fault fatal crashes was 0.76-0.80 fatal crashes per billion kilometers and 15-16 fatal crashes per million registration years.
Conclusions
We calculated a crash incidence for the “unavoidable” crashes which was 20–27% smaller than the observed crash rate of ESC-fitted passenger cars in our previous study. We concluded that suicides, active driver input until the crash, and challenging weather and road conditions are the most difficult factors for current active safety systems. Our analysis did not account for issues such as system usability or driver acceptance and therefore our results should be regarded as something that is currently theoretically achievable. However, the observed incidence is a good reference for automated driving development and the crash rate of automated cars.}

Police reports provide a rich source of data on the proximal causes (e.g., impairment by alcohol, failure to look properly) of road traffic collisions. Yet, road safety research has raised concerns about the quality and reliability of police reported data. In the UK crash report form, contributory factors are categorised (e.g., vehicle defects, driver error or reaction) to aid police officers in identifying appropriate factors. However, discord between the classification of contributory factors in crash reports and police officers’ own categorical perceptions may lead to misunderstanding, and in turn, misreporting of contributory factors. The current investigation recruited 162 police officers to report their perceptions of the relations among contributory factors in the UK crash report form. Hierarchical clustering analysis was used to identify an optimal category structure based on police officers’ perceptions. The clustering analysis identified a classification system with seven or eleven categories of contributory factors, maximising the internal coherence of categories and minimising discord with police officers’ perceptions. The findings also yield new insights into police officers’ perceptions of crash causation and demonstrate how statistical techniques can be used to inform the design of road traffic collision report forms.}

However, pedestrian behaviour plays a central role in road accidents, notably in terms of illegal road crossing at signalized intersections. This study focuses on pedestrians crossing illegally at a signal light, and specifically investigates uncertainty behaviour, also referred to as hesitation, which occurs when a pedestrian slows down or stops his/her crossing movement then (1) abandons the crossing by returning to the kerb or (2) accelerates to cross the road more quickly. We sought to understand the causes of this behaviour in France and Japan, two countries where interesting differences have already been demonstrated in the way pedestrians behave. The results show a longer period of uncertainty for pedestrians in Japan compared to France. Japanese pedestrians also hesitated longer when they were alone. This study demonstrates a tendency to speed up if there are a number of pedestrians already crossing the road, but abandoning behaviours were more frequently observed than acceleration. This study confirms that pedestrians may misevaluate the moment to cross and hesitate when they realise that they have made a mistake, thus increasing the risk of an accident. These results could help to find solutions that prevent illegal and dangerous road-crossing behaviours.}

The proposed method allows the length of each hotspot to be determined dynamically based on constraints the users impose. The calculation of the Dynamic Site Length (DSL) method is based on Dynamic Programming, and it is shown to be effective to find the close-to-optimal solution with computationally feasible complexity. The screening method has been demonstrated using historical crash data from extended freeway routes in San Francisco, California. Using the Empirical Bayesian (EB) estimate as a safety measure, we compare the performance of the proposed DSL method with other conventional screening methods, Sliding Window (SW) and Continuous Risk Profile (CRP), in terms of their optimal objective value (i.e., performance of detecting sites under the highest risk). Moreover, their spatio-temporal consistency is compared through the site and method consistency tests. Findings show that DSL can outperform SW and CRP in investigating more hotspots under the same amount of resources allocated to DES by pinpointing hotspot locations with greater accuracy and showing improved spatio-temporal consistency.}

Then we assessed their driving competencies and self-regulation practices by using different scenarios on a driving simulator. These scenarios were designed to test drivers in situations that were intended to solicit the cognitive competencies identified as problematic for elderly drivers (attention, executive functions: anticipation, planning, mental flexibility). Results showed that, although elderly drivers did not always perform as well as young drivers, they could put in place compensatory strategies which may reduce their risk of being injured and future research should explore ways of enhancing those strategies. In particular, more should be done in order to strengthen elderly’s understanding regarding their driving difficulties and help them set up coping methods with respect to these difficulties.}

abstract = {Channelized right turns or slip lanes have been widely implemented as an effective countermeasure of reducing traffic delay and number of conflicts between vehicles at signalized intersections. However, only a few studies have investigated the impact of channelized right turns (in left-band driving countries) on pedestrian safety. Channelized right turns may increase the risks for pedestrians since they bring pedestrian-vehicle interactions in a fully non-signalized environment. Furthermore, the increased turning radius at channelized lanes can lead to higher vehicle speeds. This paper investigates the impact of channelized right turns on pedestrian safety based on surrogate safety and behavior measures. Video data were collected from twelve signalized intersections in the city of Zunyi, China, involving three main types of right-turn designs: 1) non-channelized right-only lanes, 2) non-channelized right-through lanes, and 3) channelized right-turn lanes. Different measures are used, including interaction and behavior measures based on a recent-proposed Distance-Velocity model, the PET measurement, speed measurements, and observations of failures in interactions (pedestrian retreats and evasive maneuvers from pedestrians or vehicles). Results indicate that the design of channelized right-turn lane increases pedestrian risks at signalized intersections from different dimensions of safety. The impact of the nighttime condition on pedestrian safety was also compared. Pedestrians are safer at nighttime at non-channelized locations, while the impact of nighttime conditions on pedestrian safety at channelized intersections was not ascertained. Consequently, cities should be cautious to install channelized intersections as a safety countermeasure. Treatments are needed to improve pedestrian safety if channelized right turns are implemented.}

A total of 42 Chinese drivers were selected to participate in this study according to their score on the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire, including 22 morning-type drivers and 20 evening-type drivers. During the experiment, the participants completed one cognitive task (visual-spatial working memory), two simulated driving tasks (car-following task and pedestrian-crossing task), and the Dula Dangerous Driving Index (DDDI). The results showed that evening-type drivers self-reported more dangerous driving behaviors but had better lateral control on the simulated driving task than morning-type drivers. In addition, evening-type drivers had greater accuracy when performing the visual-spatial working memory task. Moreover, the accuracy on the visual-spatial working memory task positively predicted the percentage of time over the speed limit by 10 mph (POS10) and negatively correlated with the reaction time measure (time to meet pedestrians) in the pedestrian-crossing task. The relationships among chronotype, cognitive ability and driving behavior are also discussed. Understanding the underlying mechanisms could help explain why evening-type drivers perform dangerous driving behaviors more often.}

Based on 2261 car-to-cyclist accidents provided by in-depth accident databases, accidents are analyzed more specifically from kinematic reconstructions. The main accident scenarios are determined: crossing nearside, crossing farside, longitudinal, turning (right and left) and others. Proportion of brakes activation by the drivers before the impact was also given for those scenarios. The relative positions of the cyclists to the vehicle are analyzed from few seconds before the impact until the crash. It is observed that one second before the impact most of the cyclists were at a lateral distance smaller than 5 m to the center line of the car and less than 20 m ahead of car front. Finally, the possible detection of the cyclist by implemented sensors in the vehicle and the possible triggering of an active safety system like an Automatic Emergency Braking or a Forward Collision Warning are studied. Required detection sensors parameters, such as Field Of View (FOV) and the detection range, were analyzed relatively to the scenario’s characteristics, e.g. remaining time after cyclist appearance and before the collision, differences between scenario types. Different sensor FOVs and detection ranges were analyzed to determine their possible rates of cyclist detection. The study concluded that a FOV of 60° and a range of 35 m would detect most of the cyclists in car-to-cyclist accident scenarios. It was also concluded that in about 80% of cases, the last time to trigger brake (tLTTB), i.e. the last moment to brake in order to avoid the accident based on physical and comfort braking limitations by the car, was 1 s before the collision. It was also calculated that with a FOV of 60°, 51% of cyclists could be detected up to 4 s before tLTTB, and 72% up to 1 s before tLTTB. Values found in this paper can be useful to determine some of the specifications of an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS), e.g. detection sensor coverages, available time to trigger an autonomous emergency braking or forward collision warning device. Those values are given for general ADAS sensors specification but also per scenario in the case of sensors that can adapt to a specific scenario.}

An online survey at Time 1 (N = 167) assessed the TPB constructs of attitude, subjective norm and perceived behaviour control (PBC), and the additional factors of habit, mindfulness and cognitive capture. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis showed that the TPB constructs accounted for 76.4% in the variance of young drivers’ intentions. The extended model, which included habit, mindfulness and cognitive capture accounted for a significant 79% of the variance in intention, and these additional factors explained a significant amount of variance over and above the TPB constructs.

Results from a multiple regression analysis of Time 2 found that, as expected, intention was a significant predictor of the behaviour of monitoring/reading a smartphone while driving.

Information collected included a researcher-administered questionnaire, crash details from the Integrated Road Information System (IRIS), injury information from the State Trauma Registry and a virtual on-line site inspection. Overall, 42 % of crashes involved a motor vehicle and 58 % did not involve a motor vehicle. Twenty-one percent of all crashes involved cyclist loss of control, 18% were crashes with another cyclist, 18% involved hitting an object and 1% involved a pedestrian. . Bicycle crashes were severely under-reported with only 40 percent reported to the Police. Approximately half of crashes occurred at intersections (51 %) and half at midblock (non-intersection) sites (49 %). Fifty-seven percent of crashes that occurred at intersections involved a motor vehicle, whereas only 27% of crashes that occurred at midblocks involved a motor vehicle. The majority of cyclists’ injuries were classified as minor according to the Injury Severity Score with the mean number of body regions injured being 4.5 (SD = 2.2). The mean number of days in hospital care was 5.2 days (SD = 5.6, range: 1–33). These findings can be used to guide road infrastructure treatments that reduce the risk of bicycle crashes in Western Australia and insights may inform action in other jurisdictions where cycling is increasing in popularity.}

In the present study, we used a moped riding simulator to investigate the effects of low alcohol dosages (under the limits established in Italy, and in most European countries) on the defensive riding ability of light drinkers, particularly focusing on the degree of danger characterizing their riding performance. We recruited 24 participants through a double-blind, random distribution, balanced, cross-over design. We administered moderate amounts of alcohol to participants during two sessions of moped riding simulation. The results showed that even though BAC levels were always below (mean value: 0.03 g/dL) the limit allowed by Italian traffic law (0.05 g/dL), alcohol induced a reduction in safe riding behaviors, as indicated by the greater amount of hazardous scenes faced with dangerous riding behaviors when participants were under the influence of alcohol than when they were sober. Moreover, low BAC levels had a greater detrimental influence when a certain amount of learning had already been achieved by the participants (i.e., in the last experimental session). The results suggest that the effect of a low dose of alcohol interacts with participants’ self-confidence.}

As many accidents involved with a forklift can be attributed to the low situation awareness (SA) of the operator, it is essential to understand the factors influencing a forklift operator’s SA for reducing forklift accidents, especially of collision type. Against this background, this research aims to investigate how a forklift operator’s SA about other people around can be influenced by the type of subtasks they are carrying out. In this research, a virtual reality (VR) environment is used as the experiment environment, in which subjects perform a series of subtasks, such as driving, turning, reversing, loading and unloading, with a VR forklift simulation model. A SAGAT—an established SA measurement technique based on a series of queries targeting Level 1, 2, and 3 SA—is used as the main method to collect data about subjects’ SA in the experiment. The analysis of the data reveals that a forklift operator is likely to have a reduced SA about the workers around when he/she is performing a loading or unloading task due to attention narrowing, which occurs when a person concentrates on a cognitively demanding task. The findings provide insights into how forklift operator SA could be improved through an SA-oriented safety training program and also how sensing technologies might assist forklift operators with maintaining a good SA.}

abstract = {Recent field data analyses have shown that lumbar spine fractures occurred more frequently in late model vehicles than the early ones in frontal crashes. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate risk factors associated with lumbar spine fractures in frontal crashes. Parametric simulations were conducted using a set of validated vehicle driver compartment model, restraint system model, and a HIII mid-size male crash test dummy model. Risk factors considered in the study included occupant seating posture, crash pulse, vehicle pitch angle, seat design, anchor pre-tensioner, dynamic locking tongue, and shoulder belt load limiter. ANOVA and ANCOVA were used to test the statistical significance (p < 0.05). Simulation results showed that all the factors that reduced the risk of submarining increased the lumbar spine forces, indicating a direct conflict between submarining and lumbar spine fractures. Among all the factors selected, seat structure is the most significant factor in determining the lumbar spine force (p < 0.001). Crash pulse severity, time at which the peak crash deceleration reached, and pitch angle are also crucial for lumbar spine force. Specifically, increase in vehicle pitch angle increased lumbar spine force, but reduced injury measures to other body regions; while a crash pulse with early peak produced greater lumbar spine force than that with a late peak. On average, more reclined posture increased the lumbar spine force compared to upright posture, and decreases in the coefficient of friction between the pelvis and the seat cushion reduced the lumbar spine force. However, they are not statistically significant. This study provided better understanding of effects from design countermeasures to reduce occupant lumbar spine injuries in new generation of vehicle models.}

The current study analyses the braking behaviour and accident probability of the drivers under increasing time pressure conditions. Two perilous events (pedestrian crossing and obstacle overtaking) were designed to examine Brake Pedal Force (BPF) and Brake-To-Maximum Brake (BTMB) transition time on a driving simulator. Eighty-five Indian licensed drivers drove the simulator in three different time pressure conditions: No Time Pressure (NTP) (baseline), Low Time Pressure (LTP), and High Time Pressure (HTP). Random parameters Tobit model was used for analysing BPF and duration analysis approach was considered for BTMB analysis. Further, generalized linear mixed model with logit link function was used to study the effect of BPF and BTMB on accident probability of the drivers. The model results showed that gender, driving profession, approach speed, age, driving history, and driving condition significantly affected braking behaviour of the drivers. It was observed that in pedestrian crossing event, LTP and HTP driving conditions resulted in 42.31 % and 87.28 % increase in BPF and 13 % and 23 % reduction in BTMB respectively with respect to NTP driving condition and the corresponding changes were slightly lower in case of obstacle overtaking event. The accident probability model showed that female drivers needed 119.70 % and 186.08 % more BPF and 37.55 % and 58.51 % less BTMB in LTP and HTP driving conditions respectively to have equivalent risk levels as observed for male drivers. Further, non-professional drivers had to increase their BPF by 166.83 % in LTP and 219.93 % in HTP to offset their increased accident risk as compared to professional drivers under time pressure conditions.}

The specification of safety and efficiency are both based on empirically supported concepts and data. In numerical analyses with empirical vehicle trajectories at two sites, we demonstrate intuitive response to systematic variation in numerical values selected as inputs, as well as whether the scope of the efficiency consideration is selfish or systemwide. The proposed balancing is aligned with the standard “Hand Rule” criterion to demonstrate that a duty of care has been met, in which a burden must be borne if it is less than the product of the probability of loss to a third party and the magnitude of loss. Thus the proposed approach is intended to be useful for designers of control algorithms for AVs to establish that they have met their duty of care, taking both safety and efficiency into account.}

abstract = {Stopping Sight Distance (SSD) is the distance defined in most highway design guides as the distance required by drivers to safely come to a complete stop in case of an emergency. Accordingly, design guides define theoretical values for SSD and recommend that these requirements are satisfied at all points along a highway corridor. SSD is estimated as a function of speed, driver reaction time, and deceleration rate, which are all factors that vary by both driver and driving conditions. Despite the anticipated uncertainty in those variables, they are all modelled deterministically. Unfortunately, this is an inaccurate assumption and provides no information about the extent to which roads designed to meet SSD requirements are able to satisfy road user demand for SSD. Design guides also fail to provide information about the impact a segment that fails to meet driver needs has on safety. To overcome those limitations, this paper assesses the ability of existing roads to satisfy stochastically modelled road user demand for SSD. The Available Sight Distance (ASD) was first quantified for a group of top crash-prone segments, and a Monte Carlo Simulation was used to model demand for SSD. The proportion of the test highways that failed to meet driver demands for SSD was then quantified by comparing the ASD to the required SSD at different levels of driver demand. Furthermore, the paper also compares the safety performance between regions that meet SSD and those that fail to do so. Among other findings, the paper shows that, on average, 6.8 % of the length of the test segments are noncompliant to the SSD demands of 70 % of the driving population. On the other hand, the average percent noncompliance for 30 % of the driving population (the 30 % with limited abilities) was 12.1 %. It was also found that, on average, crash rates in the noncompliant regions were two to three times higher than those in the compliant regions at the 70 % level (i.e., in regions that fail to meet the SSD demands of 70 % of the driving population).}

However, the trend differs across Iran provinces, and hence identifying factors that relate to road fatality and injury counts is an essential tool for improving road safety management programs and policies in the provinces. In this study, a statistical model was developed within a Bayesian framework with the aim of examining the annual fatal and non-fatal injury counts in the provinces of Iran during the period 2005–2015. Specifically, a bivariate spatial negative binomial Bayesian model with random effects was specified and estimated to account for unobserved heterogeneity due to the simultaneity effect between fatal and non-fatal injuries, the presence of province-specific factors, and the spatial correlation between neighboring provinces. All the three effects were found to significantly relate to the frequency of both injury types. Results also indicated that overall fuel consumption and share of diesel fuel consumed were positively related to fatal and non-fatal injuries. Higher population proportions of under 15, and 15−30 years of age were found to be positively associated with fatalities and negatively with non-fatal injuries. Furthermore, the annual number of hot-spots modified per 100 km of rural roads is associated with a decrease in fatalities. Results also suggest that the number of speed cameras operating on rural roads (within a province) might significantly decrease both fatal and non-fatal injuries. Accordingly, the implementation of active and targeted hot spot programs as well as speed camera programs are likely to improve safety performance of the provinces, and help to prioritize area-wide safety initiatives and programs.}

In order to protect them, advanced driver assistance systems are being developed and introduced to the market, including autonomous emergency braking and steering systems (AEBSS) that autonomously perform braking or an evasive manoeuvre by steering in case of a pending collision, in order to avoid the collision or mitigate its severity. This study proposes a new prospective framework for quantifying safety benefit of AEBSS for the protection of cyclists and pedestrians in terms of saved lives and reduction in the number of people suffering serious injuries. The core of the framework is a novel application of Bayesian inference in such a way that prior information from counterfactual simulation is updated with new observations from real-world testing of a prototype AEBSS. As an illustration of the method, the framework is applied for safety benefit assessment of the AEBSS developed in the European Union (EU) project PROSPECT. In this application of the framework, counterfactual simulation results based on the German In-Depth Accident Study Pre-Crash Matrix (GIDAS-PCM) data were combined with results from real-world tests on proving grounds. The proposed framework gives a systematic way for the combination of results from different sources and can be considered for understanding the real-world benefit of new AEBSS. Additionally, the Bayesian modelling approach used in this paper has a great potential to be used in a wide range of other research studies.}

abstract = {Background
To deal with the increasing number of motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) among older drivers, a cognitive test has been introduced to a license renewal procedure for drivers aged ≥75 years since June 2009. This might have prompted the reduction or cessation of driving by older drivers. We therefore examined whether older drivers’ chance of experiencing MVCs as unprotected road users has increased after the test was introduced.
Methods
Using police-reported national data on MVCs from January 2005 through December 2016, we calculated the monthly injury rates (including deaths, severe injuries, and minor injuries) among unprotected road users (bicyclists and pedestrians) by sex and age group (70–74, 75–79, 80–84, and ≥85 years). The ratios of the injury rates of unprotected road users in the three oldest age groups (who were subjected to the test) to those aged 70–74 years (not subjected to the test) were also calculated. Then, we conducted an interrupted time-series analysis based on the injury rate ratios to control for extraneous factors affecting MVCs over the study period.
Results
There was a significant increase in traffic injuries of unprotected road users at the time the test was introduced among females aged 75–84 years, and at a later time among males aged ≥80 years and females aged ≥85 years.
Conclusion
Licensing policies for older drivers should be rigorously evaluated, taking into account the safety of older unprotected road users, and should be balanced against it.}

abstract = {Non-recurrent congestion is frustrating to travelers as it often causes unexpected delay, which would result in missing important meetings or appointments. Major causes of non-recurrent congestion include adverse weather conditions, natural hazards, and traffic accidents. Although there has been a proliferation of studies that investigate how adverse weather conditions and natural hazards impact road congestion in urban road networks, studies that look into determinants of the congestion caused by a traffic accident are scarce. This research fills in this gap in the literature. When a traffic accident occurs on an urban link, the congestion would propagate to and affect adjacent links. We develop a modified version of the Dijkstra's algorithm to identify the set of links in the neighborhood of the accident. We first measure the level of congestion caused by the traffic accident as the reduction in traveling speed on those links. As the impact of congestion varies both in space and in time, we then estimate a generalized linear mixed-effects model with spatiotemporal panel data to identify its determinants. Finally, we conduct a case study using real data in Beijing. We find that: (1) the level of congestion is mostly associated with the types of the traffic accidents, the types of vehicles involved, and the occurrence time; (2) for the three types of traffic accidents, namely, scrape among vehicles, collisions with fixed objects, and rear-end collisions, the level of congestion associated with the first two types are comparable, while that associated with the third type is 8.43% more intense; (3) for the types of vehicles involved, the level of congestion involving buses/trucks is 6.03% more intense than those involving only cars; (4) for the occurrence time, the level of congestion associated with morning peaks and afternoon peaks are 5.87% and 6.57% more intense than that associated with off-peak hours, respectively.}

In this study, a methodology to obtain robust and unbiased results when modeling imbalanced, high-resolution accident data is described. Based on a data set covering the whole highway network of Austria in a fine spatial (250 m) and temporal (1 h) scale, the effects of 48 covariates on accident occurrence are analyzed, with a special emphasis on real-time weather variables obtained through meteorological re-analysis. A balanced bagging approach is employed to cope with the issue of class imbalance. By fitting different tree-based classifiers to a large number of bootstrapped training samples, ensembles of binary classification models are established. The final prediction is achieved through majority vote across each ensemble, resulting in a robust prediction with reduced variance. Findings show the merits of the proposed approach in terms of model quality and robustness of the results, consistently displaying accuracies around 80% while exhibiting sensitivities of approximately 50%. In addition to certain features related to roadway geometrics, surface condition and traffic volume, a number of weather variables are found to be of importance for predicting accident occurrence. The proposed methodological take may not only pave the way for further analyses of high-resolution road safety data including real-time information, but can also be transferred to any other imbalanced classification problem.}

abstract = {Recently, technologies for predicting traffic conflicts in real-time have been gaining momentum due to their proactive nature of application and the growing implementation of ADAS technology in intelligent vehicles. In ADAS, machine learning classifiers are utilised to predict potential traffic conflicts by analysing data from in-vehicle sensors. In most cases, a condition is classified as a traffic conflict when a safety surrogate (e.g. time-to-collision, TTC) crosses a pre-defined threshold. This approach, however, largely ignores other factors that influence traffic conflicts such as speed variance, traffic density, speed and weather conditions. Considering all these factors in detecting traffic conflicts is rather complex as it requires an integration and mining of heterodox data, the unavailability of traffic conflicts and conflict prediction models capable of extracting meaningful and accurate information in a timely manner. In addition, the model has to effectively handle large imbalanced data. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a centralised digital architecture and employs a Deep Learning methodology to predict traffic conflicts. Highly disaggregated traffic data and in-vehicle sensors data from an instrumented vehicle are collected from a section of the UK M1 motorway to build the model. Traffic conflicts are identified by a Regional–Convolution Neural Network (R-CNN) model which detects lane markings and tracks vehicles from images captured by a single front-facing camera. This data is then integrated with traffic variables and calculated safety surrogate measures (SSMs) via a centralised digital architecture to develop a series of Deep Neural Network (DNN) models to predict these traffic conflicts. The results indicate that TTC, as expected, varies by speed, weather and traffic density and the best DNN model provides an accuracy of 94% making it reliable to employ in ADAS technology as proactive safety management strategies. Furthermore, by exchanging this traffic conflict awareness data, connected vehicles (CVs) can mitigate the risk of traffic collisions.}

The aim of this study was to adapt the MDSI to the Spanish spoken in Spain and to the rules and driving habits of Spaniards. The Argentinian version of the MDSI was taken as the source version. The sample consisted of 1173 drivers, who completed the Spanish version of the MDSI. The factor structure was analysed by means of an Exploratory Factor Analysis (AFE) and a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (AFC). The 6-factor structure of the Argentinian version of the MDSI was replicated with higher internal consistency values for each of the DS. The original Argentinian and the Spanish versions share 23 items, indicating a relevant overlap in the construct. A cluster analysis grouped the DS into two groups: maladaptive and adaptive. Significant associations were found between DS measures and demographic variables (gender, age, and education level), driving history and theoretically related constructs like the Domain-Specific Risk-Taking Scale (DOSPERT); Lapses, Errors, Violations; Angry Driving; and Sensitivity to Rewards. The Spanish MDSI provides valid measures that could help us understand complex driving behaviours and promote safe driving.}

Understanding the principal factors that explain accident severity is considered to be the first step towards the adequate design of an accident prevention strategy. In this paper, we examine the contribution of various types of factors (vehicle, driver and others) in explaining accident severity in China. Unlike previous studies, the analysis gives a particular focus on fatal accidents. Using a large sample of 405,177 observations for 4-wheeled vehicles in the year 2017 and various statistical and econometrics approaches (e.g., OLS, quantile regression and extreme value theory), the results show that the factors explaining the severity of accidents differs significantly between normal and extreme severity accidents, e.g. across quantiles. Interestingly, we find that the gender factor is only significant for fatal accidents. In particular, the analysis shows that male drivers have an increased likelihood of extreme risk taking. On the basis of these empirical findings, a new ratemaking approach that aims to improve road safety and prevention is discussed and proposed.}

It has been commonly accepted that CV or AV technologies would reduce human errors in driving and benefit traffic safety. However, the answer of how many crashes can be prevented because of CV or AV technologies has not reached a consistent conclusion. In order to quantitatively answer this question, this study used meta-analysis to evaluate the safety effectiveness of nine common and important CV or AV technologies, and tested the safety effectiveness of these technologies for six countries. First, 73 studies about the safety impact of CV or AV technologies were filtered out from 826 CAV-related papers or reports. Second, the safety impacts of these technologies with regard to assistant types and triggering times have been compared. It shows AV technologies can play a more significant role than CV technologies, and the technologies with closer triggering time to collision time have greater safety effectiveness. Third, in the meta-analysis, the random effect model was used to evaluate the safety effectiveness, and the funnel plots and trim-and-fill method were used to evaluate and adjust publication bias, so as to objectively evaluate the safety effectiveness of each technology. Then, according to the crash data of six countries, the comprehensive safety effectiveness and compilation of safety effectiveness of the above technologies were calculated. The results show that if all of technologies were implemented in the six countries, the average number of crashes could be reduced by 3.40 million, among which the India would reduce the most (54.24%). Additionally, different countries should develop different development strategies, e.g., USA should prioritize the development of the lane change warning and intersection warning, the UK should prioritize applications related to intersection warning and rear-end warning. Overall, this study provides comprehensive and quantitative understating of the safety effectiveness of CA or AV technologies and would contribute to government, vehicle companies, and agencies in deciding the development priority of CA or AV technologies.}

abstract = {Objective
Motorsport crash events are complex and driver restraint systems are unique to the motorsport environment. The National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, Incorporated (NASCAR®) crash and medical datasets provide an opportunity to assess crash statistics and the relationship between crash characteristics and driver injury. Injury risk curves can estimate driver injury risk and can be developed using vehicle incident data recorder information as inputs. These relationships may provide guidance and insight for at-track emergency response, driver triage and treatment protocols.
Method
Eight race seasons of crash and medical record data (including Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) scores) from the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series \& NASCAR Xfinity Series were processed and analyzed. Multiple logistic regression modeling was used to produce injury risk curves from longitudinal and lateral resultant change in velocity, resultant peak acceleration, principal direction of force and the number of impacts per incident.
Results
2065 Unique IDR data files were matched with 246 cases of driver injury or sub-injury (severity below AIS 1) and 1819 no-injury cases. Multiple logistic regression modeling showed increasing resultant change in velocity, resultant peak acceleration and the number of impacts during a crash event all increase estimated driver injury risk. After accounting for the other predictors in the model, right lateral impacts were found to have a lower estimated injury risk. The model produced an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve of 0.80. Across the eight race seasons in this study the overall average resultant change in velocity was 34.4 kph (21.4 mph) and the average resultant peak acceleration was 19.0 G for an average of 258 crashes per season. For 2011 through 2015, full time drivers experienced 134 times more crashes per mile traveled than passenger vehicles, but experienced 9.3 times fewer injuries per crash.
Conclusion
Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate AIS 1+ injury only and AIS 1+ with sub-injury risk for motorsport drivers using motorsport-specific crash and medical record databases. The injury risk estimate models can provide future guidance and insight for at-track emergency medical response dispatch immediately following an on-track crash. These models may also inform future driver triage protocols and influence future expenditures on motorsports safety research.}

abstract = {The predictive method of the Highway Safety Manual (HSM) estimates crash frequency by applying an uncalibrated safety performance function (SPF) and a set of uncalibrated crash modification factors (CMFs) to each location individually; then the predicted crashes must be adjusted by a local calibration factor (LCF) at the aggregate level for at least 30–50 sites per SPF. Although this calibration procedure assures total predicted crashes will be localized, still the prediction of crashes for individual locations suffers from the aggregate localization process. An alternative approach of locally calibrating the HSM predictive method is proposed to improve prediction quality at individual locations while maintaining equality of total observed and total predicted crashes. The methodology incorporates multiple calibration factors for different components of the predictive method (SPF parameters and CMFs) rather than a single calibration factor as recommended by the HSM that only calibrates at the aggregate level. In the proposed method, the application of calibration factors expressed in both weight and power function better reflects the local conditions while still ensuring calibration at the aggregate level. The parameters are estimated through an optimization process of five different methods. Rural two-lane, two-way roads (R2U) data was used from the states of Maryland, Illinois, and Washington. A tool named “Roadway Safety Data Integrator (RSDI)” was developed for data preparation. Different Goodness-of-Fit measures along with CURE plots indicated that the proposed method performed significantly better than the HSM calibration method, calibration function (that will most likely be calibration process in the HSM 2nd edition), calibrated Washington models (for the case of Washington data), and some alternative calibration methods suggested by past studies. Moreover, the results indicated that the additional parameters for CMFs could improve the prediction significantly; a previous study did not find this to be so due to data limitations, but we have improved the methodology and are not so limited. Application of the proposed approach can lead to more accurate identification of hot-spots and site-specific strategies. Considering the limitations of this study, some avenues for further research are discussed.}

A more comprehensive understanding of the ADS safety performances can be established through the California Department of Motor Vehicle disengagement and crash reports. This study comprehensively examines the safety performances (159,840 disengagements, 124 crashes, and 3,669,472 automated vehicle miles traveled by the manufacturers) documented since the inauguration of the testing program. The reported disengagements were categorized as control discrepancy, environmental conditions and other road users, hardware and software discrepancy, perception discrepancy, planning discrepancy, and operator takeover. An applicable subset of disengagements was then used to identify and quantify the 5 W’s of these safety-critical events: who (disengagement initiator), when (the maturity of the ADS), where (location of disengagement), and what/why (the facts causing the disengagement). The disengagement initiator, whether the ADS or human operator, is linked with contributing factors, such as the location, disengagement cause, and ADS testing maturity through a random parameter binary logit model that captured unobserved heterogeneity. Results reveal that compared to freeways and interstates, the ADS has a lower likelihood of initiating the disengagement on streets and roads compared to the human operator. Likewise, software and hardware, and planning discrepancies are associated with the ADS initiating the disengagement. As the ADS testing maturity advances in months, the probability of the disengagement being initiated by the ADS marginally increases when compared to human-initiated. Overall, the study contributes by understanding the factors associated with disengagements and exploring their implications for automated systems.}

abstract = {In this paper, we examine the relationship between traffic enforcement (in the form of roadside breath testing for alcohol) and traffic outcomes (alcohol-related traffic crashes) to identify an optimal point of traffic enforcement. In Western Australia (WA), Police are authorised to stop any driver and measure their blood alcohol concentration via a sample of their breath. Using a metric employed by Ferris et al. (2013) and a methodology analogous to that utilised by Cameron (2013), we model the relationship between alcohol related traffic crashes and the saturation of breath testing in WA from January 2008 to April 2018. Our analysis suggests that given the saturation of breath testing in 2018 (1.2 tests per licenced driver), a 10 % increase in breath testing would be associated with a decline of 0.34 alcohol related traffic crashes (ARTC) per 100,000 drivers per month, equating to six fewer crashes per month, state-wide. In addition, using ‘willingness to pay’ and human capital cost metrics to approximate the social costs of ARTC, we employ a cost-benefit analysis to estimate the point at which the social costs of ARTC equal the economic costs of breath tests. Our analysis suggests that an increase in the number of tests to 143 % of all licensed WA drivers (an increase of 450,000 breath tests from the 2017/18 financial year) would be anticipated to save the state AUD$13.3 million annually in the human capital costs of ARTC. Our findings suggest that a further increase in breath tests to 154% of all licensed WA drivers (an increase of 650,000 breath tests from 2017/18) may save the state AUD$31.0 million annually in willingness to pay costs. The analytics below present a novel combination of methods to approximate the relative economic merits of increases in traffic enforcement. Furthermore, the findings outlined here have practical applications for operational policing, while providing an analytical perspective for policy makers faced with making recommendations regarding the volume and saturation of breath tests.}

abstract = {Objectives
This study assessed the effect of Chile’s 2005 traffic law reform (TLR) on the rates of road traffic deaths (RTD) in children aged 0–14 years, adjusting for socioeconomic differences among the regions of the country.
Methods
Free-access sources of official and national information provided the data for every year of the study period (2002–2013) and for each of the country’s 13 upper administrative divisions with respect to RTD in child pedestrians and RTD in child passengers (dependent variables), and the following control variables: the number of road traffic tickets processed, investment in road infrastructure, poverty, income inequality, insufficient education, unemployment, population aged 0–14 years, and prevalence of alcohol consumption in the general population. Interrupted time series analyses (level and slope change impact model), using generalized estimating equation methods, were conducted to assess the impact of the TLR (independent variable) on the dependents variables.
Results
There was a significant interaction between time and Chile’s 2005 TLR for a reduction in child pedestrians (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79-0.96) and passengers RTD (IRR for interaction 0.80, 95% CI 0.67-0.96) trends. In addition, in child pedestrians, RTD rates were affected by poverty (IRR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02–1.05), income inequality (IRR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00–1.04), and unemployment (IRR 0.94, 95% CI 0.90-0.98), whereas in the case of child passengers, poverty (IRR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01–1.08) and income inequality (IRR 0.93, 95% CI 0.91-0.95) were significant.
Conclusions
Large-scale legislative actions can be effective road safety measures if they are aimed at promoting behavioral change in developing countries, improving the safety of children on the road. Additionally, regional socioeconomic differences are associated with higher RTD rates in this population, making this an argument in favor of road safety policies that consider these inequalities. The number of road traffic tickets processed and the investment in road infrastructure were not significant.}

Safety on urban arterials that are adjacent to a higher speed freeway may be impacted by speed spillover or adaptation. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of raising freeway speed limits on the frequency of crashes on urban arterial roads adjacent to freeways (spillover effects). Crash data within Michigan were collected on 1393 urban arterial road segments before and after freeway speed limits were altered. Before-and-after data was collected simultaneously on 1470 comparison segments of urban arterial where speed limits did not change to control for the regression-to-the-mean bias. The mixed effects negative binomial (MENB) regression model was developed to analyze crash frequency on urban arterials. The results indicate that raising speed limits of freeways by as little as five miles per hour had a likelihood of increasing crash frequency on adjacent arterial roads by as much as 13.9 percent. To investigate if the safety impact of speed spillover changes with the distance from the freeway, influence areas (0–1 mile, 1–2 mile, and 2–3 mile) were used. The findings of this study provide insights into the effects of speed spillover on crash occurrences, and it demonstrates that increasing freeway speed limit has a negative influence on driver compliance with the speed limit on adjacent arterial roads. Correspondingly, the influence of freeway speed on drivers’ speeding behavior on adjacent urban arterials fades away with the distance from the freeway.}

In this study, we use eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)—a Machine Learning (ML) technique—to detect the occurrence of accidents using a set of real time data comprised of traffic, network, demographic, land use, and weather features. The data used from the Chicago metropolitan expressways was collected between December 2016 and December 2017, and it includes 244 traffic accidents and 6073 non-accident cases. In addition, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanation) is employed to interpret the results and analyze the importance of individual features. The results show that XGBoost can detect accidents robustly with an accuracy, detection rate, and a false alarm rate of 99 %, 79 %, and 0.16 %, respectively. Several traffic related features, especially difference of speed between 5 min before and 5 min after an accident, are found to have relatively more impact on the occurrence of accidents. Furthermore, a feature dependency analysis is conducted for three pairs of features. First, average daily traffic and speed after accidents/non-accidents time at the upstream location are interpreted jointly. Then, distance to Central Business District and residential density are analyzed. Finally, speed after accidents/non-accidents time at upstream location and speed after accidents/non-accidents time at downstream location are evaluated with respect to the model’s output.}

Due to increasing transportation demand and potential threat to public, commercial dangerous goods transportation (CDGT) has drawn attention from decision makers and researchers within governmental and non-governmental safety organization. However, there are few studies focusing on driving risk assessment of commercial dangerous-goods truck by environmental factors. In this paper we employ survival analysis methods to analyze the impact of risk exposure factors on non-accident mileage of commercial dangerous-good truck and assess risk level of specific driving environment. Using raw location data from six transportation companies in China, we derive a set of 17 risk exposure factors that we use for model parameters estimation. The survival model and hazard model were estimated using the Weibull distribution as the baseline distribution. The results show that four factors - weather, traffic flow, travel time and average velocity have a significant impact on the non-accident mileage of driver in this company, and the assessment results of survival function and hazard function are robust to the different levels of testing data. The employment time has some effect on the results but does not result in a significant difference in most cases, and the task stability has little impact on the results. The findings of this study should be useful for decision makers and transportation companies to better risk assessment of CDT.}

abstract = {“Semi-controlled” crosswalks are unsignalized, but clearly marked with “yield to pedestrian within crosswalk” signs. Ideally, pedestrians can cross the street immediately after they arrive at the curb. However, real world observations show that pedestrians and vehicles are often involved in non-verbal “negotiations” to decide who should proceed first. This kind of “negotiation” often causes delays for both parties and may lead to unsafe situations. The study in this paper was based on video recordings of the waiting behaviors of 2059 pedestrians interacting with 1003 motorists at selected semi-controlled crosswalks. One such location experienced a conversion from one-way operation to two-way operation, which provided a rare opportunity for a before-and-after study at that location. Multi-state Markov models were introduced as a novel approach to correlate the dynamic process between recurrent events. Time-varying covariates related to pedestrian characteristics, traffic condition, and vehicle dynamics (distance and speed) turned out to be significant. The analytical method developed in this study provides a tool to dynamically model pedestrian waiting decisions with uncertainties. Model results reveal that, after the conversion from one-way to two-way operation, the probability of a pedestrian accepting a lag decreases from 69.7% to just below 60% on the same street. In addition, pedestrians are more hesitant to cross a two-way street than a one-way street. Countermeasures that increase motorist yielding rate or reduce pedestrian confusion will enhance safety such crossing locations.}

Investigators should, however, ensure that the used virtual environment is validated in accordance with the experiment’s intended research question since behavior in virtual environments has been shown to differ to behavior in real environments. This article presents the street crossing decisions of 30 participants who were facing an approaching vehicle and had to decide at what moment it was no longer safe to cross, applying the step-back method. The participants executed the task in a real environment and also within a highly immersive VR setup involving a head-mounted display (HMD). The results indicate significant differences between the two settings regarding the participants’ behaviors. The time-to-contact of approaching vehicles was significantly lower for crossing decisions in the virtual environment than for crossing decisions in the real one. Additionally, it was demonstrated that participants based their crossing decisions in the real environment on the temporal distance of the approaching vehicle (i.e., time-to-contact), whereas the crossing decisions in the virtual environment seemed to depend on the vehicle’s spatial distance, neglecting the vehicle’s velocity. Furthermore, a deeper analysis suggests that crossing decisions were not affected by factors such as the participant’s gender or the order in which they faced the real and the virtual environment.}

The detection algorithm consists of two modules. The first module predicts the bounding boxes of the driver's right hand and right ear from RGB images. The second module takes the bounding boxes as input and predicts the type of distraction. 106,677 frames extracted from videos, which were collected from twenty participants in a driving simulator, were used for training (50%) and testing (50%). For distraction classification, the results indicated that the proposed framework could detect normal driving, using the touchscreen, and talking with a phone with F1-score 0.84, 0.69, 0.82, respectively. For overall distraction detection, it achieved F1-score of 0.74. The whole framework ran at 28 frames per second. The algorithm achieved comparable overall accuracy with similar research, and was more efficient than other methods. A demo video for the algorithm can be found at https://youtu.be/NKclK1bHRd4.}

Unfortunately, many treatments are unfamiliar to or misunderstood by drivers, especially when lacking explicit rules (e.g., shared lanes). To date, research has largely investigated bicycle infrastructure from a bicyclist's perspective, but with little research from the driver's perspective. The objective of this research is to utilize a driving simulator to investigate driver behavior towards different bicycle infrastructure treatments when driver behavior is not provoked by an interaction with bicyclists. More specifically, this research intends to investigate the impact of bicycling frequency and treatment familiarity, as well as the combined effect of the two, on driver behavior at each treatment type. The treatments investigated are shared lane markings called “sharrows”, standard bike lanes, bike boxes, and merge lanes. The results show that bicycling frequency significantly affects the proportion of drivers making eye glances at treatments. In addition, drivers more familiar with bike boxes stopped significantly further back from bike boxes, and drivers more familiar with merge lanes performed the merge maneuver significantly earlier. Furthermore, driver speed and lane positioning at bike lanes was significantly affected by the combination of bike lane familiarity and bicycling frequency, but not individually. This research is a first step towards understanding driver behavior and expectation of bicyclists; an essential understanding for infrastructure treatments that do not provide physical barriers between bicycles and automobiles, and instead rely on driver behavior for safety.}

This paper 1) analyzes the extent to which drivers engage in multitasking additional-to-driving (MAD) under various conditions, 2) specifies odds ratios (ORs) of crashing associated with MAD, and 3) explores the structure of MAD.
Methods
Data from the Second Strategic Highway Research Program Naturalistic Driving Study (SHRP2 NDS) was analyzed to quantify the prevalence of MAD in normal driving as well as in safety-critical events of various severity level and compute point estimates and confidence intervals for the corresponding odds ratios estimating the risk associated with MAD compared to no task engagement. Sensitivity analysis in which secondary tasks were re-defined by grouping similar tasks was performed to investigate the extent to which ORs are affected by the specific task definitions in SHRP2. A novel visual representation of multitasking was developed to show which secondary tasks co-occur frequently and which ones do not.
Results
MAD occurs in 11 % of control driving segments, 22 % of crashes and near-crashes (CNC), 26 % of Level 1–3 crashes and 39 % of rear-end striking crashes, and 9 %, 16 %, 17 % and 28 % respectively for the same event types if MAD is defined in terms of general task groups. The most common co-occurrences of secondary tasks vary substantially among event types; for example, “Passenger in adjacent seat – interaction” and “Other non-specific internal eye glance” tend to co-occur in CNC but tend not to co-occur in control driving segments. The odds ratios of MAD using SHRP2 task definitions compared to driving without any secondary task and the corresponding 95 % confidence intervals are 2.38 (2.17–2.61) for CNC, 3.72 (3.11–4.45) for Level 1–3 crashes and 8.48 (5.11–14.07) for rear-end striking crashes. The corresponding ORs using general task groups to define MAD are slightly lower at 2.00 (1.80–2.21) for CNC, 3.03 (2.48–3.69) for Level 1–3 crashes and 6.94 (4.04–11.94) for rear-end striking crashes.
Conclusions
The number of secondary tasks that the drivers were engaged in differs substantially for different event types. A graphical representation was presented that allows mapping task prevalence and co-occurrence within an event type as well as a comparison between different event types. The ORs of MAD indicate an elevated risk for all safety-critical events, with the greatest increase in the risk of rear-end striking crashes. The results are similar independently of whether secondary tasks are defined according to SHRP2 or general task groups. The results confirm that the reduction of driving performance from MAD observed in simulator studies is manifested in real-world crashes as well.}

abstract = {Mobile phone distracted driving is a major risk factor for crashes. However, this behaviour has been increasing in recent years. Effective enforcement of mobile phone bans while driving faces several obstacles; as such, it is important to consider additional countermeasures. Applications designed to prevent distracted driving are a promising solution, yet more research is needed that examines their effectiveness in reducing dangerous phone use while driving behaviours. Additionally, these applications are voluntary in nature; therefore, an understanding of drivers’ perceptions of the applications is necessary to determine how to improve uptake. A mixed methods design was utilised to examine these factors in a comprehensive manner. A total of 40 participants used the smartphone application “Do Not Disturb While Driving” for iOS phone operating systems or “Android Auto” for Android phone operating systems for approximately one week and completed three diary entries reporting on their experience. Two questionnaires that examined phone use while driving behaviours were also administered to participants; one before and one after completing the study. The quantitative results found that engagement in 1) visual-manual, 2) cognitive-auditory and 3) music mobile phone interactions significantly decreased while using the application. Distraction engagement and mental workload while driving also significantly decreased while using the application. The qualitative results identified a number of areas of improvement that need to be addressed, e.g. activation of the application and Bluetooth connection reliability. The features that required improvement presented an obstacle for effective use of the applications, and in some cases resulted in drivers deciding to stop using the application. Positive perceptions of the application were associated with the experiences of the application functioning appropriately and activating automatically. These results show that applications designed for voluntary use to prevent mobile phone distracted driving are a promising countermeasure, although current applications require several improvements.}

abstract = {Discretionary lane-changing (DLC) is one of the complex driving manoeuvres that requires surrounding traffic information for efficient and safe manoeuvring. The connected environment not only provides such information but also increases situational awareness, which is useful for DLC decision-making. However, the literature is devoid of any concrete evidence of such impact of the connected environment on DLC decision-making. As such, this paper analyses the effects of the connected environment on DLC behaviour. Seventy-eight participants from a diverse background performed DLCs in randomised driving conditions using the CARRS-Q advanced driving simulator. These driving conditions are: baseline (without driving messages), connected environment with perfect communication (fully functioning and uninterrupted supply of driving messages), and connected environment with communication delay (impaired communication). Various key driving behaviour indicators are analysed and compared using a linear mixed model. To analyse the effects of the connected environment on DLC decision-making, two Generalised Estimation Equation (GEE) models are developed for gap acceptance and DLC duration. In addition, a Weibull accelerated failure time hazard-based duration model is developed to investigate the impact of the connected environment on safety associated with DLC manoeuvres. We find that drivers in the connected environment have a larger spacing, larger lead and lag gaps, a longer DLC duration, and a lower acceleration noise compared to the baseline condition. The GEE model on gap acceptance reveals that drivers tend to select relatively bigger gap sizes when the connected environment offers them the subsequent gap information. Similarly, the GEE model for DLC duration suggests that the connected environment increases DLC durations by 2.22 s and 2.11 s in perfect communication and communication delay driving conditions, respectively. Finally, the hazard-based duration model provides insights into the probability of avoiding a lane-changing collision, and indicates that the probability of a lane-changing collision is less in the connected environment driving conditions than in the baseline scenario. Overall, the connected environment improves the DLC driving behaviour and enhances traffic safety.}

This study aims to develop a comprehensive zone-based index to represent both biking attractiveness and cyclist crash risk. The developed Bike Composite Index (BCI) consists of two sub-indices representing bike attractiveness and bike safety, which are estimated using Bike Kilometers Travelled (BKT) and cyclist-vehicle crash data from 134 traffic analysis zones (TAZ) in the City of Vancouver, Canada. The Bike Attractiveness Index is calculated from five factors: bike network density, centrality, and weighted slope as well as land use mix and recreational density. The Bike Safety Index is calculated from bike network coverage, continuity, and complexity as well as signal density and recreational density. The correlation between the Bike Attractiveness Index and the Bike Safety Index in Vancouver is low (r = 0.11), supporting the need to account for both biking attractiveness and safety in the composite index.}

The fast growth of economy in Iran as a developing country has also been accompanied by an alarming situation in terms of fatalities in truck-involved crashes, among the drivers and passengers of the trucks as well as the other vehicles involved. Despite the sizable efforts to investigate the truck-involved crashes, very little is known about the safety of truck movements in developing countries, and about the single-truck crashes worldwide. Thus, this study aims to uncover significant factors associated with injury severities sustained by truck drivers in single-vehicle truck crashes in Iran. The explanatory factors tested in the models include the characteristics of drivers, vehicles, and roadways. A random threshold random parameters hierarchical ordered probit model is utilized to consider heterogeneity across observations. Several variables turned out to be significant in the model, including driver’s education, advanced braking system deployment, presence of curves on roadways, and high speed-limit. Using those results, we propose safety countermeasures in three categories of 1) educational, 2) technological, and 3) road engineering to mitigate the severity of single-vehicle truck crashes.}

Recent studies suggest heavy vehicle drivers self-estimate their sleepiness unexpectedly low during night duties. The present study compared sleepiness ratings of long-haul truck drivers with those of long-haul airline pilots during night and non-night duties. In addition, the correspondence between self-rated manifest and predicted latent sleepiness was examined in the two groups.
Methods
Twenty-two drivers and 33 pilots participated. Their working hours, sleep, on-duty sleepiness, and use of sleepiness countermeasures were measured in naturalistic conditions. Predictions of latent sleepiness were based on the measurements of working hours and sleep using the Sleep/Wake Predictor modelling tool.
Results
Drivers rated lower levels of sleepiness than pilots during both duty types, though predicted latent sleepiness levels were very similar among the two groups. Neither the results of sleep nor those of sleepiness countermeasures explained the difference in self-rated sleepiness.
Discussion
The results raise the possibility that long-haul truck drivers are actually sleepier than they report, and thus are at an increased risk for not responding to sleepiness in a timely manner. A potential explanation for this behavior is lack of education and training on sleepiness among truck drivers as compared with airline pilots. Alternatively, long-haul truck drivers may be exceptionally tolerant to soporific working conditions. The first reported results do not, however, support this hypothesis.}

The Poisson-Tweedie distribution offers a unified framework to model overdispersed, underdispersed, zero-inflated, spatial, and longitudinal count data, as well as multiple response variables of similar or mixed types. The form of its variance function is simple, and can be specified as the mean added to the product of dispersion and mean raised to the power P. The flexibility of the Poisson-Tweedie distribution lies in the domain of P, which includes positive real number values. Special cases of the Poisson-Tweedie distribution models include the linear form of the negative binomial (NB1) model with P equal to 1.0, the geometric Poisson (GeoP) model with P equal to 1.5, the quadratic form of the negative binomial (NB2) model with P equal to 2.0, and the Poisson Inverse Gaussian (PIG) model with P equal to 3.0. A series of models were developed in this study using the Poisson-Tweedie distribution without any restrictions on the value of the power parameter as well as with specific values of the power parameter representing NB1, GeoP, NB2, and PIG models. The effects of fixed and varying dispersion parameters (i.e., dispersion as a function of covariates) on the variance and expected crash frequency estimates were also examined. Three years (2012–2014) of crash data from urban three-leg stop-controlled intersections and urban four-leg signalized intersections in the state of Florida were used to develop the models. The Poisson-Tweedie models or the GeoP models were found to perform better when the dispersion parameter was constant or fixed. With the varying dispersion parameter, the NB2 and PIG models were found to perform better, with both performing equally well. Also, the fixed dispersion parameter values were found to be smaller in the models with a higher value of the power parameter. The variation across the models in their estimates of weight factor, expected crash frequency, and potential for safety improvement of hazardous sites based on the empirical Bayes method was also discussed.}

These three countries were selected to enable comparisons of a priori acceptance between countries of differing levels of exposure to highly automated cars. Participants (N = 1563; 62.1 % male) were recruited in Australia (n = 558), France (n = 625), and Sweden (n = 380) to complete a 20 min online questionnaire. The findings differed according to country of residence. Individuals residing in France reported significantly greater intentions to use highly automated cars when they become publicly available compared to individuals residing in Australia and in Sweden. Of the TPB constructs entered at step 1 in the hierarchical regression, attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control (capability and controllability) were significant predictors of intentions to use highly automated cars for participants residing in Australia and France. For participants residing in Sweden, only attitudes and PBC-capability were significant predictors of intentions. Of the UTAUT constructs entered at step 2, performance expectancy and effort expectancy were significant predictors of intentions for participants residing in France and only performance expectancy a significant predictor of intentions for participants residing in both Australia and Sweden. Age and gender did not add to the prediction of intentions when entered at step 3. However, pre-existing knowledge was a significant negative predictor of intentions when entered at step 3 for participants residing in Australia. Overall, the findings found some support for applying the TPB and UTAUT to assess intentions to use highly automated cars in different countries.

abstract = {Introduction
The threat of application of legal sanctions remains the prominent approach to reduce the prevalence of drink driving in a vast array of motoring jurisdictions. However, ongoing questions remain regarding: (a) the extent that such mechanisms impact upon offending behaviours, (b) the deleterious effect alcohol consumption has on decisions to drink and drive and (c) how best to operationalise (and measure) the concept of drink driving to enhance the accurate measurement of the dependent variable.
Method
This paper reports on an examination of 773 Queensland motorists' (across nine local government areas) perceptions of both legal and non-legal drink driving sanctions (as well as alcohol consumption) in order to gauge the deterrent impact upon a range of measures of drink driving: the driver thinking they are over the limit, the driver knowing they are over the limit, attempts to evade random breath testing, and intentions to re-offend. The sample completed an online or paper version of the questionnaire.
Results
The majority of participants reported “never” engaging in “possible” (74.5 %) or “acknowledged” (83.4 %) drink driving events, although a considerable proportion of the sample reported engaging in “possible” (25.5 %) or “acknowledged” (16.6 %) drink driving and attempting to evade RBT (18 %) events, as well as possible intentions to drink and drive in the future (22 %). Males were more likely to report such events. Perceptions of both legal sanctions (certainty, severity and swiftness) as well as non-legal sanctions (fear of social, internal or physical harm) were relatively high and consistent with previous research. Interestingly, non-legal sanctions were reported as stronger deterrents than legal sanctions. However, multivariate analysis revealed that legal deterrents had limited utility predicting offending behaviours, but rather, demographic characteristics (e.g., younger motorists, males) as well as risky drinking behaviour were better predictors. In regards to intentions to offend, a past conviction for drink driving was also a predictor of re-offending.
Practical applications
These results highlight the ongoing challenges of addressing the problem of drink driving and that some motorists: (a) have entrenched behaviour and/or (b) make the decision to drink and drive before they are under the influence of alcohol.}

Video recordings of in-vehicle and external scenes were coded for precisely defined categories of secondary tasks and related contextual variables. The findings indicated that nearly one-quarter of the total driving time at intersections was spent on secondary activities and that lower engagement occurred within intersections compared to phases immediately upstream or downstream. Drivers were less likely to occupy themselves with secondary tasks when their vehicles were moving than when they were stationary. Elderly drivers showed less inclination to perform secondary tasks than did younger drivers. Lastly, drivers tended to perform secondary tasks less frequently at intersections managed by traffic signs than those controlled by traffic lights, when they did not have priority compared to when they had priority, and in adverse weather conditions compared to fine weather conditions. In conclusion, drivers appeared to self-regulate secondary task engagement in response to roadway and environmental conditions. Specifically, they exercised self-regulation by reducing their secondary task engagement when the driving task was more challenging. The findings from this study provide preliminary evidence for targeting the education and training of drivers and media campaigns related to safe driving strategies and managing distractions.}

abstract = {Introduction
Accident risk is increased for emergency responders driving with warning lights and sirens compared to other road users’ driving. Currently no standards for education of ambulance drivers exist. Research shows that high order understanding trainings focusing on insight to avoid critical driving situations might be more helpful than trainings focusing on car handling. The present controlled intervention study evaluates a one-day simulator-based high order training program specifically designed for ambulance drivers.
Methods
In a longitudinal design with three measurement times multiple methods were used to evaluate the training holistically targeting the levels of reaction to training, learning, behavior and results of training. Questionnaire, knowledge test and driving profile data were analyzed with repeated measures analysis of variance controlling for age and sex. Data of two intervention groups and one control-waiting group was collected between 2014 and 2017 in two German federal states.
Results
183 German paramedics (age: M = 33.1, SD = 9.4, 21.9 % female) participated in the study. 147 participants (80.3 %) completed post-training tests, and 30 participants (16.4 %) completed follow-up measurements six months after training. Participants’ reaction to training was positive directly after the training, and dropped slightly over time. Intervention group participants gained traffic-relevant knowledge compared to control group participants. Risk sensitivity of regular driving situations was the only attitude variable positively affected by training. This effect was not sustained six months after training. Training led to a decrease of average and maximum speed in short- as well as long-term measurements but did not affect drivers’ acceleration. Although speed was lower in post-tests, emergency response times did not differ.
Conclusion
The simulator-based training for paramedics has small but notable effects on drivers’ knowledge, attitudes and real driving behavior. Although only very few measured variables showed positive training effects, no negative training effects were found. Speed was reduced in the long term which underlines the importance of such a training. More research is needed to determine effects on different types of participants and to elicit framework conditions for training integration in formal education.}

In the first step, a grouping was made according to the AIS definition of body regions: head, face, neck, thorax, abdomen and pelvic contents, spine, upper extremities (including shoulder girdle) and lower extremities (including pelvis). In a second step, the body regions were divided in organs, parts of the spine, and parts of the extremities. The three most often injured anatomical structures of each body region were estimated for drivers and front seat passengers in each type of crash. For drivers, an injury risk greater than 2.4 % was found for the lower extremities (pelvis) and the head (concussion) in side oblique near side impacts, for the head in frontal oblique near side impacts (concussion) and for the lower extremities (ankle joint) in frontal impacts. For passengers, an injury risk greater than 2.4 % was found for the thorax (lungs) in side near side impacts, for the head (concussion) in front oblique near side impacts, and for the thorax (sternum) and the upper extremities (wrist, hand) in frontal impacts.

We implement a modified version of the Extended Motif Discovery (EMD) algorithm, a classical variable-length motif detection algorithm for time-series and we applied it to the UAH-DriveSet, a publicly available naturalistic driving dataset. After a systematic exploration of the extracted motifs, we were able to conclude that the EMD algorithm was not only capable of extracting simple manoeuvres such as accelerations, brakes and curves, but also more complex manoeuvres, such as lane changes and overtaking manoeuvres, which validates motif discovery as a worthwhile line for future research.}

abstract = {Inter-national benchmarking of road safety, with the purpose of achieving continuous improvement by learning lessons from existing best practices, has currently been widely encouraged by most countries as an emerging management tool to improve the level of road safety. However, performing a successful road safety benchmarking practice is by no means easy. Challenges exist from ascertaining the benchmarking framework at the very beginning to making final policy decisions. In this study, based on the identification of leading road safety risk factors, a comprehensive set of hierarchically structured safety performance indicators was developed, some necessary data processing procedures were conducted, and the use of data envelopment analysis (DEA) for composite indicator (CI) construction was elaborated. An interval multiple layer DEA-based CI model was proposed to take both the hierarchical structure of the indicators and the data uncertainty into account, and was used to benchmark road safety performance for a set of European countries. Based on the model output, best-performing and underperforming countries were distinguished and all the countries were further ranked by computing their cross-index score. Moreover, by taking the characteristics of each country in the data set into account, country-specific benchmarks for those underperforming countries were identified, and useful insight in the areas of underperformance in each country was gained. Meanwhile, by summarizing the risk aspects that need urgent policy action for all these countries, some specific road safety enhancing recommendations for this region as a whole were formulated.}

The principal component analyses revealed that the four-factor structure of the Pedestrian Behavior Scale (PBS) was highly consistent across the five countries. ANCOVA results revealed significant differences between countries on the PBS items and scale scores. Specifically, Greek and Turkish participants reported transgressive pedestrian behaviors more frequently than Estonian, Kosovar, and Russian pedestrians while Kosovar participants reported transgressive pedestrian behaviors less frequently than Estonian pedestrians. In addition, Turkish and Russian pedestrians reported lapses and aggressive behaviors more frequently than Estonian, Greek, and Kosovar pedestrians. Finally, Turkish and Estonian pedestrians reported positive behaviors more frequently than Kosovar pedestrians. Unexpectedly, the regression analyses showed that values have varying effects on pedestrian behavior in the five countries. That is, context or country may determine the effect of values on pedestrian behaviors. The results are discussed in relation to the previous literature.}

Gap acceptance at intersections is a frequent and complex driving task that requires high visual attention from drivers. This study aims to investigate the effect of mobile phone use on the gap acceptance manoeuvre at intersections. Different mobile phone use positions, intersection type, gap size and driver characteristics were considered in the study. A total of 41 licenced drivers drove in an advanced driving simulator in three phone use conditions: baseline (no phone use), using the phone under the steering wheel (covert) and using the phone above the steering wheel (overt). Drivers drove the simulator three times and experienced two intersection types (straight-forward vs. left-turn) and two gap sizes (4 s vs. 7 s) during each drive. A parametric accelerated failure time (AFT) duration model was developed to evaluate the intersection crossing completion time of drivers. The results showed no significant difference of gap acceptance behaviours between the two phone use positions. The distraction task did not affect drivers’ gap acceptance decision, but it increased the crossing completion time by over 10 % compared to baseline. Besides, drivers behaved conservatively at intersections while using a mobile phone, such as adopting a larger deceleration, waiting a longer time, and mainting a larger distance to the front vehicle, etc. However, these compensational behaviours were not helpful in improving the intersection traffic situation regarding both safety and efficiency. Intersection type and gap size were both significant factors of gap acceptance decision and crossing completion time. Additionally, younger drivers were more likely to accept a gap than older drivers, and female drivers spent longer time to cross the intersection than males.}

Coupled friction tests have been performed in a controlled manner on five test track with varying texture properties and significant statistical relationship has been derived between Wet Grip Index (WGI), as defined in the European Tyre Labelling Procedure and the International Friction Index (IFI), according to World Road Association (PIARC) friction harmonization experiment. If a temperature correction of skid data is applied a good correlation between WGI and IFI can be obtained.

However, research has devoted scant attention to advance guide signs for exit ramps. This study aimed to identify and propose optimal design alternatives for exit ramp advance guide signs for different types of exit spacing. This study conducted a driving simulation experiment consisting of five design alternatives of advance guide signs and two exit ramp spacing variation. Eight indicators were measured. The repeated-measure analysis of variances (ANOVA) and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) were performed for the influence analysis and efficiency evaluation of different schemes. Influence analysis results showed better design alternatives in five schemes of advance guide signs, enabling drivers to more easily locate destination exits and change lanes fewer times, in addition to reducing drivers’ need to decelerate, and improving traffic flow in the key influence range of destination exit ramps. The percentage of drivers successfully locating the destination exits also increased with optimal design alternatives of advance guide signs. When the exit ramp spacing tightened, on the other hand, drivers had to make more lane changes and accelerate and decelerate more frequently in the key influence range. As a result, a lower percentage of drivers successfully located destination exits. Efficiency evaluation results were also obtained. In tight spacing, three advance guide signs are recommended to be placed at 1 km, 0.5 km and 0 km prior to the beginning of the tapered deceleration lane. If conditions are limited, at least two advance guide signs should be used. With greater spacing, four advance guide signs are recommended, located at 2 km, 1 km, 0.5 km, and 0 km prior to the beginning of the tapered deceleration lane. If road conditions are limited, three advance guide signs should be used.}

In a prior study we identified potential eye movement and EEG markers of cognitive distraction during driving hazard perception. However the extent to which these markers are affected by the demands of the hazard perception task are unclear. Therefore in the current study we assessed the effects of secondary cognitive task demand on eye movement and EEG metrics separately for periods prior to, during and after the hazard was visible. We found that when no hazard was present (prior and post hazard windows), distraction resulted in changes to various elements of saccadic eye movements. However, when the target was present, distraction did not affect eye movements. We have previously found evidence that distraction resulted in an overall decrease in theta band output at occipital sites of the brain. This was interpreted as evidence that distraction results in a reduction in visual processing. The current study confirmed this by examining the effects of distraction on the lambda response component of subjects eye fixation related potentials (EFRPs). Furthermore, we demonstrated that although detections of hazards were not affected by distraction, both eye movement and EEG metrics prior to the onset of the hazard were sensitive to changes in cognitive workload. This suggests that changes to specific aspects of the saccadic eye movement system could act as unobtrusive markers of distraction even prior to a breakdown in driving performance.}

The study was motivated by the longer-term goal of predicting injury outcomes in a future fleet in which all vehicles are expected to have passive safety performance equivalent to a 5-star NCAP rating level (the highest star rating and lowest risk of injury). The dataset used to evaluate injury risk was the National Automotive Sampling System / Crashworthiness Data System (NASS/CDS). Case years 2010–2015 were used. An injured occupant was defined as a vehicle occupant who experienced an injury of maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) of 2 or greater, or who were fatally injured. Injury severity was scored using AIS-2005 (2008 update). Cases were selected in which front-row occupants of late-model vehicles were exposed to a near-side crash. Logistic regression was used to develop an injury model with delta-v, belt status, age, and gender as predictor variables. The side crash performance of each vehicle was identified and added to the model by matching each case with the associated performance in the NCAP moving deformable barrier side impact crash test. NCAP MDB test performance, delta-v, and occupant age, sex, and BMI were found to be significant predictors of injury risk. The effect of a 5 % higher risk in the MDB test (approximately one star rating worse) was comparable to a 2.84 km/h increase in delta-v. This model informs the development of active safety systems in a future fleet where vehicle passive safety performance is higher, quantified by the NCAP MDB test.}

For this purpose, the Second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP2) Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) data are used, which include forward-facing videos and time series information with regard to trips conducted at or near the locations of HVE implementation. To capture the intensity and duration of speeding and tailgating, scaled metrics are developed. These metrics can capture varying levels of aggressive driving behavior enabling, thus, a direct comparison of the various behavioral aspects over time and among different drivers. To identify the effect of HVE and other trip, driver, vehicle or environmental factors on speeding and tailgating, while accounting for possible interrelationship among the behavior-specific scaled metrics, Seeming Unrelated Regression Equation (SURE) models were developed. To analyze the likelihood of occurrence of unsafe lane changes and ‘other’ aggressive driving behavior types, a grouped random parameters ordered probit model with heterogeneity in means and a correlated grouped random parameters binary logit model were estimated, respectively. The results showed that drivers’ awareness of HVE implementation has the potential to decrease aggressive driving behavior patterns, especially unsafe lane changes and ‘other’ aggressive driving behaviors.}

This paper evaluates the effects of HRGC geometric parameters on crash occurrence and severity likelihoods. The competing risk algorithm is selected to simultaneously analyze crash occurrence and severities. Four main HRGC geometric factors, along with other contributors, are investigated at 3,194 public HRGCs in North Dakota. This study focuses primarily on four geometric features of an HRGC: (1) acute crossing angle, (2) number of tracks (indicator of crossing width), (3) the roadway distance between the HRGC and the signalized intersection, and (4) number of highway lanes. Distance to the nearest roadway intersections and highway-railway crossing angles are map-based calculations drawn from geographic information systems (GIS). The findings are: (1) all contributors tested in this study, including highway characteristics, traffic exposures from both railway and highway, and the four geometric features, significantly affect at least one crash severity level; (2) all contributors significantly impact crash frequency except for the distance between crossings and the nearest roadway intersection; and (3) geometric parameters’ long-term effects on cumulative probability of crash severity and occurrence over 30 years is also evaluated. Crossings with three main tracks contribute the highest long-term crash probabilities.}

To enhance road safety, it was suggested that researchers should shift their efforts to exploring which billboard characteristics are distracting by nature. This line of research may promote the establishment of concrete guidelines for the least distracting permissible billboards. A previous study classified billboards into three clusters: 1. Loaded (colorful billboards with small quantities of graphic elements and large quantities of text); 2. Graphical (colorful billboards with large quantities of graphic elements and small quantities of text); and 3. Minimal (billboards with few or no graphic elements, few colors, and a small amount of text). The current study systematically explores the effect of these three clusters on drivers’ performance in a driving simulator. Eighteen participants drove in scenarios which systematically manipulated the following variables: the perceptual load on the road, the perceptual load on the sides of the road, location of preplanned critical events, and the presence of billboards from each one of the three previously identified clusters. The findings show that the presence of billboards from the Loaded and Minimal clusters significantly compromised road safety in various experimental conditions. However, the presence of billboards from the Graphical cluster significantly affected drivers’ performance only in one experimental condition. The conclusion, for the time being, is that Graphical billboards, which include a large quantity of graphic elements with few or no textual elements, are the least harmful while driving.}

abstract = {Run-off-road (ROR) crashes have always been a major concern as this type of crash is usually associated with a considerable number of serious injury and fatal crashes. A substantial portion of ROR fatalities occur in collisions with fixed objects at the roadside. Thus, this study seeks to investigate the severity of ROR crashes where elderly drivers, aged 65 years or more, hit a fixed object. The reason why the present study investigates this issue among older drivers is that, comparing to younger drivers, this age group of drivers have different psychological and physical features. Because of these differences, they are more likely to get injured in ROR types of crashes. This paper applies two types of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, including hybrid Intelligent Genetic Algorithm and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using the crashe information of California in 2012 obtained from Highway Safety Information System (HSIS) database. Although the results showed that the developed ANN outperformed the hybrid Intelligent Genetic Algorithm, the hybrid approach was more capable of predicting high-severity crashes. This is rooted in the way the hybrid model was trained by taking advantage of the Genetic Algorithm (GA). The results also indicated that the light condition has been the most significant parameter in evaluating the level of severity associated with fixed object crashes among elderly drivers, which is followed by the existence of the right and left shoulders. Following these three contributing factors, cause of collision, Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT), number of involved vehicles, age, road surface condition, and gender have been identified as the most important variables in the developed ANN, respectively. This helps to identify gaps and improve public safety towards improving the overall highway safety situation of older drivers.}

Indeed, this phenomenon can lead to a complete loss of contact between the tire and the road caused by the layer of water that develops between them, resulting in a complete loss of longitudinal and lateral grip. Although the phenomenon of hydroplaning is about 60 years old, it is almost impossible to find any scientific estimation of how frequently vehicle accidents can be caused by hydroplaning, especially in Europe. To cover this gap, the well-known German In-Depth Accident Study (GIDAS) project has assisted to conduct a study. Thanks to GIDAS, it was possible to identify a sufficient number of cases on wet roads including a high accuracy of information about relevant parameters. With a physical analysis of all the cases, it was possible to compute the probability for an accident case to be in a full hydroplaning situation. This allowed for a precise estimate of the real importance of full hydroplaning situations on accident occurrence, which appears to be a much rarer accident cause than most drivers think.}

The situations investigated as part of an ISO 26262 hazard \& risk analysis are broken down into crash configurations. These crashes are analyzed from the perspective of the ADAS-equipped vehicle with the failing system as well as from the crash opponent's point of view. Mainly due to sample size limitations, we focus on belted front-row vehicle occupants. We cluster the crash data into traffic domains (TD) based on the speed limit, i.e., residential streets, city roads, arterial thoroughfares, rural roads, and intercity highways and calculate the crash speed distribution for each domain. The injury severity clustering is based on the ISS injury aggregator with cut-offs at 4, 9, and 16 for S1, S2, and S3, respectively. We estimated the 90th-percentiles of the S-parameter cut-offs with a 95% confidence level using the GIDAS accident database. The percentiles were calculated for the ADAS-equipped vehicle as well as for the crash opponent, stratified for crash type (front, oblique, side). The stratification had to be detailed further for side crashes as impact direction (near-side vs. far-side) and availability of a curtain airbag restraint system have a significant impact on injury severity.

Since 1990, the Victorian GDL scheme has undergone several modifications including the introduction of new requirements and the stricter enforcement of existing regulations. Our evaluation of the GDL is based on monthly mortality and morbidity data for drivers 18–25 for the period January 2000 to June 2017. We estimate the immediate and long-term impacts of each policy change to the GDL system. Our results indicate that several initiatives in the GDL system have had impacts on both fatalities and injuries requiring hospitalisation when differentiated by gender. In a number of cases we observe that reactions to these measures are common to both genders. These include: the signalling of the proposed GDL changes in the media, the introduction of an extra probationary year for those under 21, the total alcohol ban for the entire probationary period, and limits on peer passengers for the first year. Stricter mobile phone restrictions appear to have had no impact on injuries for either males or females although they were associated with lower fatality rates for both. In addition, we found an indication that in the period prior to the introduction of the mandatory requirement of 120 h supervised driving, there was a rise in male driver injuries possibly caused by a rush of more inexperienced learners to obtain their probationary licence.}

abstract = {As part of the emerging world of intelligent transportation, there is considerable interest in developing connected vehicles that are more capable of identifying and guiding individual drivers’ behavior than collecting mileage as a moving cart. The two goals of this study are (a) to build a conceptual framework for driver assessment and (b) develop recommendation systems to evaluate individual driving performance and guide driver behaviors, thus improving the network traffic conditions and individuals’ perceived safety. A safety score is defined relatively by comparing a driver’s individual pattern to a standard “safe driver” pattern. To elaborate, the proposed system adopts advanced data mining techniques to extract, identify, characterize, and display driving behavior patterns. The scoring system provides a basis of assessing individual drivers, who are then recommended to mimic a nearby “safe” driver in a connected environment. To evaluate and implement the proposed conceptual framework, an anonymous trajectory dataset collected from Pittsburgh urban area is applied to build the scoring system, which is then integrated within a virtually simulated environment. The results show that the proposed behavior assessment and recommendation system framework improves the overall performance of a connected traffic system beyond those attained through baseline connectivity principles.}

The behavior of young people, including their driving norms, is influenced by the dominant social discourse in their age group. Thus, the nature of the interaction between young drivers and their peers may contribute to increased or decreased risk exposure not only for everyone in the car, but also for other road users, and therefore warrants deeper examination. This study aims to shed light on driving with friends as a particular case of driving with peers. It was designed to examine the role of the four dimensions of the Safe Driving Climate among Friends (SDCaF) scale, in predicting young drivers’ intention to take risks behind the wheel, beyond the contribution of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). The sample consisted of 166 participants (70 men, 96 women), ranging in age from 17 to 24 years, who completed a set of self-report questionnaires. The findings demonstrate that the SDCaF dimensions, and especially perceived friends' pressure while driving, add to the explained variance in intention to engage in risky driving, beyond the variance explained by gender and the three components of the TPB. In addition to its theoretical expansion of the TPB model to include specific components relating to perceived driving with friends, the study’s practical significance lies in directing efforts towards revealing pathways to reduce reckless driving among young people, through engaging their friends in the process.}

However, other important environmental factors such as road alignment have not been considered. This paper aims to propose a methodology in investigating rear-end collision avoidance behavior under varied foggy conditions, with focusing on changes in visibility and road alignment in this study. A driving simulator experiment with a mixed 2 × 4 × 6 factor design was conducted using an advanced high-fidelity driving simulator. The design matrix includes two safety-critical conditions, four visibility conditions, and six road alignment situations (in terms of the road curve and slope). Behavior variables from different dimensions were identified and compared under varied conditions. To estimate the safety of drivers, a time-based measurement, speed reduction time, is selected among the variables as a measure of safety. The survival analysis approach was introduced to model the relationship between environmental factors and driver safety, using speed reduction time as the survival time. Both the Kaplan-Meier method and the COX model were applied and compared. Results generally suggest that reduced visibility leads to more dangerous rear-end collision avoidance behavior from different aspects. Though findings are mixed regarding the road alignment, the impact of the road alignment was found to be significant. Interestingly, conditions of downward slope were found to be safer. Overall, the COX model outperformed the Kaplan-Meier method in understanding the impact of environmental factors, and it can be applied to investigate other contributing factors for freeway safety under foggy weather conditions.}

In the United States (U.S.), the Highway Safety Manual provides a number of SPFs for a variety of road facilities. Due to the limited availability of traffic data in many regions, the transferability of SPFs has been an important topic in traffic safety analysis and has been evaluated by several studies. Nevertheless, the international transferability of freeway SPFs and the applicability of transferred SPFs on hotspot identification has been rarely investigated. Based on data from two Chinese cities, Shanghai and Suzhou, and three U.S. states, Texas, New York and Florida, this study analyzes the transferability of freeway SPFs between Chinese and U.S. regions. These SPFs are then transferred to the other country and their performance on hotspot identification is investigated. SPFs were developed in the frameworks of Poisson, Poisson-lognormal and negative binomial regressions for the five localities separately, and were calibrated using the calibration functions before being transferred. Without calibration, the poor model transferability was found between the two countries, while after calibration, the transferred SPFs between Shanghai/Suzhou and Texas/New York showed satisfactory performance on both model fitting and hotspot identification. However, the transferability of SPFs between Florida and the Chinese cities turned out to be unsatisfactory regardless of whether being calibrated or not, which was attributable to the considerable difference in traffic flow. The findings of this study are expected to be a good reference for researchers and practitioners who want to understand the transferability and applicability of SPFs in the international context.}

A survey of over 3400 respondents across Bangladesh, China, Kenya, Thailand, the UK, and Vietnam revealed a similar pattern for most of the relationships assessed, in most countries; those who reported higher fatalistic beliefs or more external attributions of causality also reported performing riskier pedestrian behaviours and holding more dangerous attitudes to road safety. The strengths of relationships between constructs did, however, differ by country, behaviour type, and aspect of fatalism. One particularly notable country difference was that in Bangladesh and, to a lesser extent, in Kenya, a stronger belief in divine influence over one’s life was associated with safer attitudes and behaviours, whereas where significant relationships existed in the other countries the opposite was true. In some cases, the effect of fatalistic beliefs on self-reported behaviours was mediated through attitudes, in other cases the effect was direct. Results are discussed in terms of the need to consider the effect of locus of control and attributions of causality on attitudes and behaviours, and the need to understand the differences between countries therein.}

Identifiable individual-level driver licensing and motor vehicle crash data are essential to advancing transportation safety research. However, epidemiologic studies using such data are rare, which may reflect their inaccessibility. We conducted a legal mapping study to evaluate US state laws regulating access to driver licensing and motor vehicle crash data for use in scientific research.
Methods
Legal statutes regulating the release of driver licensing and motor vehicle crash data for all 50 US states and the District of Columbia (D.C.) were retrieved. Legal text was evaluated to determine whether these jurisdictions authorize release of identifiable individual-level licensing and crash data for use in non-governmental research.
Results
Thirty-six states and D.C. explicitly authorize release of identifiable individual-level licensing data to researchers. Only five states and D.C. authorize release of identifiable individual-level crash records. No states explicitly prohibit the release of individual-level data about licensing records and only three states prohibit release of individual-level crash record data, meaning that in many states it is ambiguous whether and when releasing such data to researchers is permitted.
Conclusions
It is important to understand why licensing data are not used more frequently in transportation safety research given that many state laws permit access for non-governmental researchers. Reforming state laws to clarify and increase access to identifiable individual-level crash report data is an important priority for transportation safety advocates and researchers.}

In Beijing, a type of new-designed crosswalk markings in China (NCMC) was installed. However, evaluating the effectiveness of this type of crosswalk markings was not conducted. Accordingly, the objective of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of this type of new-designed crosswalk markings. During the evaluation process, the vehicle-pedestrian interaction was considered; standard crosswalk markings in China (SCMC) were taken as a control group. In addition, empirical data were collected from a driving simulator, and nine evaluating indicators representing vehicle operating data, drivers’ maneuvering data and drivers’ subjective evaluation were proposed. In order to combine nine indicators, a Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method was used in this study to achieve the premium degrees of these two types of crosswalk markings. The evaluation result showed that, for intersections with high or low pedestrian flow, the comprehensive effectiveness and influences on drivers’ driving behaviors with presence of NCMC were better than those with presence of SCMC, no matter where vehicle-pedestrian interactions occurred. For intersections with no pedestrians, the comprehensive effectiveness and influences on drivers’ driving behaviors with presence of NCMC were worse than those with presence of SCMC, no matter where vehicle-pedestrian interaction occurred. These results may provide references for facility installing and future development of standards.}

abstract = {For pedestrians, the risk of dying in a traffic accident is highest on rural roads, which are often characterized by a lack of sidewalks and high traffic speed. In fact, hitting the pedestrian during an overtaking attempt is a common crash scenario. To develop active safety systems that avoid such crashes, it is necessary to understand and model driver behavior during the overtaking maneuvers, so that system interventions are acceptable because they happen outside drivers’ comfort zone. Previous modeling of driver behavior in interactions with pedestrians primarily focused on road crossing scenarios. The aim of this study was, instead, to address pedestrian-overtaking maneuvers on rural roads. We focused our analysis on how drivers adjust their behavior with respect to three safety metrics (in order of importance): 1) minimum lateral clearance when passing the pedestrian, 2) overtaking speed at that moment, and 3) the time-to-collision at the moment of steering away to start the overtaking maneuver. The influence of three factors on the safety metrics was investigated: 1) walking direction (same as the overtaking vehicle or opposite), 2) walking position (on the edge of the vehicle lane or 0.5 m away from the edge on the paved shoulder), and 3) oncoming traffic (absent or present). Seventy-seven overtaking maneuvers in France from the naturalistic driving study UDRIVE and 297 maneuvers in Sweden from field tests were analyzed. Bayesian regression was used to model how minimum lateral clearance and overtaking speed depended on the three factors. Results showed that drivers maintained smaller minimum lateral clearance and lower overtaking speed when the pedestrian was walking in the opposite direction, on the lane edge, or when oncoming traffic was present. Minimum lateral clearance and time-to-collision were only weakly correlated with overtaking speed. The regression models predicted distributions similar to those actually observed in the data. The time-to-collision at the moment of steering away was comparable in value to the time-to-collision used by Euro NCAP for testing active safety systems in car-to-pedestrian longitudinal scenarios since 2018. This study is the first to analyze driver behavior when overtaking pedestrians, based on field test and naturalistic driving data. Results suggest that pedestrian safety is particularly endangered in situations when the pedestrian is walking opposite to traffic, close to the lane, and when oncoming traffic is present. The Bayesian regression models from this study can be used in active safety systems to model drivers’ comfort in overtaking maneuvers.}

However, safety statistics have reached a plateau and actions for further improvement of OHS management systems are called for. OHS is a form of organizational expertise that has both tacit and explicit dimensions and is situated in the ongoing practices. There is a need for institutionalization and for the transfer of knowledge across and along construction supply chains to reduce OHS risks and facilitate cultural change. The focus of this article is the factors that facilitate OHS knowledge transfer in and between organizations involved in construction projects. An interpretative methodology is used in this research to embrace tacit aspects of knowledge transfer and application. Thematic analysis is supported by a cognitive mapping technique that allows understanding of interrelationships among the concepts expressed by the respondents. This paper demonstrates inconsistency in OHS practices in construction organizations and highlights the importance of cultivating a positive safety culture to encourage transfer of lessons learnt from good practices, incidents, near misses and failures between projects, from projects to programmes and across supply chains. Governmental health and safety regulations, norms and guidelines do not include all possible safety issues specific to different working environments and tied to work contexts. The OHS system should encourage employees to report near misses, incidents and failures in a ‘no-blame’ context and to take appropriate actions. This research provides foundation for construction project practitioners to adopt more socially oriented approaches towards promoting learning-rich organizational contexts to overcome variation in the OHS and move beyond the current plateau reached in safety statistics.}

Investigating drivers’ behavior while performing passing maneuvers could provide helpful information on the factors that influence this process. Driving simulators have become important tools for driving behavior research studies as they are safe, facilitate the controlled use of experimental variables, and generate detailed output data. It remains to be seen whether simulator results can be considered representative of real-life driving conditions. With respect to passing maneuvers, no study has made a comprehensive and direct comparison between drivers’ passing behavior in the field and driver behavior observed in a simulated environment. In this validation study, a fixed-base interactive simulator was used to collect data from fifty-four participants (eighteen Iranians and thirty-six Italians) involved in several traffic scenarios on a two-lane rural highway segment (obtained by varying the speed of opposing vehicles, lead vehicles and headways in the opposite direction). A 3D model and its environmental characteristics were realized from the real segment which had previously been surveyed with drones to collect videos and derive data on real passing maneuvers. The results for the two-sided K–S test revealed no statistically significant difference in the accepted gap, effective accepted gap, perception reaction time, and time to collision variables between the field and the simulator at the 95 % confidence level. However, when conducting a one-sided K–S test, some statistical directional differences were found in the cases of the accepted gap and perception reaction time variables, which exhibited lower values in the field compared to the simulator again at the 95 % confidence level. Although the passing duration was statistically higher in the simulator than in the field, the shape of the two distributions was not statistically different. Analysis showed that differences in the passing duration are due to the lower passing vehicle speed and lower speed difference with the simulator than in the field, which are caused by truncating headways in the subject direction in the simulator. The cultural background of participants did not result in any discernible difference in passing behavior. The results would support a more extensive use of driving simulators in future passing behavior studies.}

abstract = {Background
Several factors may influence the decision to drink-drive (DD) in young drivers, such as the amount of alcohol consumed, exposure to an in-vehicle alcohol feedback device, and subjective responses to alcohol. Understanding of their influence on DD is lacking and may be key for targeted intervention. This randomized controlled, double-blinded, driving simulation experiment tested three main hypotheses; young drivers are more likely to engage in DD with: i) lower alcohol dose; ii) lack of exposure to an in-vehicle alcohol feedback (FB) device; and iii) lower subjective responses to alcohol intoxication (SR). Interactions between the decision to DD and SR, FB and sex were also explored.
Methods
Males (n = 80) and females (n = 80) aged 20–24 years old were randomly assigned to two conditions: i) alcohol dose (0.45 g/kg or 0.65 g/kg); and ii) exposure to an in-vehicle alcohol feedback device (no or yes). Assessment of participants’ SR following alcohol intake was based upon two measures: i) subjective intoxication measured by the discrepancy between an objective measure of intoxication and their subjective estimate of intoxication; and ii) perception of capacity to drive safely under alcohol (for both variables, a higher score represents lower SR). Participants were then asked to make either a negative or positive decision to DD while confronted with time-based contingencies related to their decision. Logistic regression and moderation analyses tested hypotheses.
Results
Approximately 60 % of participants decided to DD. Higher odds of DD were found in participants reporting higher capacity to drive (adjusted odds ratio [β] = 1.03, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1.01–1.05) and who were males (β  = 7.70; 95 % CI = 1.34–5.57). A main effect of either FB exposure or alcohol dose was not detected. Moderation analysis showed that lower SR, represented by higher perceived capacity to drive safely under alcohol was selectively predictive of greater likelihood of a decision to DD in participants not exposed to FB (effect = .054, p < .001, 95 % CI = .026–.083).
Conclusions
Lower SR was found to be associated with a greater likelihood of the decision to DD in young drivers, while exposure to an in-vehicle FB device had no effect on DD. Importantly, FB exposure appeared to disrupt the relationship between lower SR and the decision to DD, signaling that FB may be selectively effective for young drivers possessing lower SR. Future studies are needed to clarify whether FB technology, and other interventions, can be targeted to deter DD in the young drivers most likely to benefit.}

The mutual influence between two or even more adjacent speed cameras is a relevant attribute worth taking into account when evaluating the safety impacts of speed cameras. This paper investigates the safety effects of two or more speed cameras observed within a specific radius which are defined as multiple speed cameras. A total of 464 speed cameras at treated sites and 3119 control sites are observed and related to road traffic accident data from 1999 to 2007. The effects of multiple speed cameras are evaluated using pairwise comparisons between treatment units with different doses based on the propensity score methods. The spatial effect of multiple speed cameras is investigated by testing various radii. There are two major findings in this study. First, sites with multiple speed cameras perform better in reducing the absolute number of road accidents than those with a single camera. Second, speed camera sites are found to be most effective with a radius of 200 m. For a radius of 200 m and 300 m, the reduction in the personal injury collisions by multiple speed cameras are 21.4 % and 13.2 % more than a single camera. Our results also suggest that multiple speed cameras are effective within a small radius (200 m and 300 m).}

Of interest were both the participants’ compliance with the target detour message, as well as their later recall and recognition of the message. The results suggested that, first and foremost, there was significantly lower compliance with the detour message when it had been preceded by irrelevant messages on the VMS. All of the groups showed reasonably good memory for the detour message. The implications of the present study are that presentation of irrelevant messages, including advertisements and safety slogans, may result in reduced compliance to traffic-relevant messages on VMSs.}

abstract = {Speeding behaviour is known to influence crash risk among alcohol-impaired drivers, but this relationship is scarcely explored. The present study investigated the effects of different Blood Alcohol Concentrations (BAC) levels on driving performance with respect to mean speed of drivers and their ability to avoid crashes during sudden events while driving. Eighty-two drivers participated in the simulation driving experiment at four BAC levels (0%, 0.03 %, 0.05 % and 0.08 % BAC) in rural and urban driving scenarios. Two sudden events (pedestrian crossing and road crossing by parked vehicles (a car and a truck) in the perpendicular direction of traffic) were designed to evaluate the crash probabilities in both the driving scenarios. Generalized linear mixed models were developed to analyse the effects of BAC levels and driver attributes (e.g., age, gender) on mean speeds and crash probabilities. Results for mean speed showed that, compared to sober state, drivers drove 3.5 kmph, 5.76 kmph and 8.78 kmph faster at 0.03 %, 0.05 % and 0.08 % BAC respectively in the rural environment and this increment was 3.6 kmph, 3.69 kmph and 4.13 kmph in the urban environment. The model results for crash probabilities revealed that 0.03 %, 0.05 % and 0.08 % BAC levels increased the crash probabilities by 1.9 times, 2 times and 3 times in case of the rural environment and 2 times, 2.3 times and 3.5 times respectively in the urban driving environment.}

Specifically, sixty drivers drove in an anger-inducing simulated driving scenario. A video camera recorded their verbal and gestural expression during the simulator drive. Two weeks before the simulator drive, we assessed participants’ basic personality traits, driving anger expression, and aberrant driving behaviour via an online survey. State anger was measured immediately before and after the simulator drive. From recorded simulator and video data, we obtained four measures: the number of accidents (simulator), an aggressive driving score (simulator), verbal expression of driving anger (video), and related gestures and headshakes (video). Verbal and gestural expression while driving were related to an increase in state anger in the simulator drive and different self-reported measures: While observed verbal expression was positively related to lapses and negatively related to constructive expression, gestural expression was positively related to both self-reported violations and self-reported aggressive expression. The traits Emotionality and Honesty-Humility were related to an increase in state anger and to verbal expression in the simulator drive, yet, age and gender modified the relation to personality traits. Results can support the development of personalised anger management interventions and anger mitigating in-vehicle devices.}

abstract = {Introduction
This study examines the relationship between two variables–mindfulness and income–with regards to their relationship to the use of smartphones by young drivers, which has been known to increase the likelihood of car accidents, endangering young drivers and other road users. The study focuses on the relationship between these variables and the use of smartphones while driving, and how this relationship differs between males and females.
Method
The study sample included 221 young drivers who were legally permitted to drive without supervision. The subjects were first asked to complete questionnaires on mindfulness and income. Next, their smartphone use while driving was monitored over a one-month period. This study is unique as it used an objective smartphone monitoring application (rather than self-reporting) to count the number of times the young participants actually touched their smartphones while driving.
Results
The findings show that the effects of social and personal factors (i.e., income and mindfulness) on the use of smartphones while driving are significant for males but not for females.
Conclusions
Most studies that investigate differences between males and females with respect to safety focus on differences in the averages of safety-related variables (such as safety performance and outcomes). In the current study, however, we identified differences in relationships between variables and demonstrated that what predicts safety-related behavior in males may not be a good predictor for females.
Practical applications
Mindfulness and income can be used to identify male populations that are at risk of using smartphones while driving. Interventions that improve mindfulness can be used to reduce the use of smartphones by male drivers.}

Fatal accidents involving motorcycles contain mode specific characteristics, and in common with fatal accidents involving all road users, speed typically presents as a significant contributory factor. The aim of the present study is to provide quantitative estimates for the contribution of speed in situations commencing from the reaction location to the safety critical event involving a motorcyclist and resulting in a fatal accident. The contribution of speed to the resulting accident risk and accident severity is considered from this reaction point. A speed-squared versus stopping distance domain, termed the severity-risk space, is examined to determine the accident measures. The defined accident measures, namely, accident risk, accident severity and accident severity risk are calculated for sixteen fatal accidents from a police dataset of recent UK motorcycle accidents. The estimates of the defined measures are provided in terms relative to values estimated for the vehicle travelling at the speed limit at the safety critical event. The relative accident risk in response to a safety critical situation shows a partial speed dependent reaction phase and a speed-squared dependent braking phase and ranges from 1.3 to 2.8. The speed-squared dependent accident severity measure ranges from 1.4 to 7.3 at pre-impact speeds. The relative accident severity risk shows speed squared to speed cubed dependency components during the reaction phase and a speed to the power of four dependent braking phase and ranges from 2.3 to 22.8. In eight cases the collision would have been avoided had the motorcyclist been travelling at the speed limit at the critical point and in the other eight cases the relative accident severity at impact ranged from 1.4 to 17.2. The speed-squared versus stopping distance domain provides an informative parameter space for considering the accident risk and accident severity dimensions of road user accidents.}

abstract = {Objective
Protected bike lanes separated from the roadway by physical barriers are relatively new in the United States. This study examined the risk of collisions or falls leading to emergency department visits associated with bicycle facilities (e.g., protected bike lanes, conventional bike lanes demarcated by painted lines, sharrows) and other roadway characteristics in three U.S. cities.
Methods
We prospectively recruited 604 patients from emergency departments in Washington, DC; New York City; and Portland, Oregon during 2015–2017 who fell or crashed while cycling. We used a case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression to compare each fall or crash site with a randomly selected control location along the route leading to the incident. We validated the presence of site characteristics described by participants using Google Street View and city GIS inventories of bicycle facilities and other roadway features.
Results
Compared with cycling on lanes of major roads without bicycle facilities, the risk of crashing or falling was lower on conventional bike lanes (adjusted OR = 0.53; 95 % CI = 0.33, 0.86) and local roads with (adjusted OR = 0.31; 95 % CI = 0.13, 0.75) or without bicycle facilities or traffic calming (adjusted OR = 0.39; 95 % CI = 0.23, 0.65). Protected bike lanes with heavy separation (tall, continuous barriers or grade and horizontal separation) were associated with lower risk (adjusted OR = 0.10; 95 % CI = 0.01, 0.95), but those with lighter separation (e.g., parked cars, posts, low curb) had similar risk to major roads when one way (adjusted OR = 1.19; 95 % CI = 0.46, 3.10) and higher risk when they were two way (adjusted OR = 11.38; 95 % CI = 1.40, 92.57); this risk increase was primarily driven by one lane in Washington. Risk increased in the presence of streetcar or train tracks relative to their absence (adjusted OR = 26.65; 95 % CI = 3.23, 220.17), on downhill relative to flat grades (adjusted OR = 1.92; 95 % CI = 1.38, 2.66), and when temporary features like construction or parked cars blocked the cyclist’s path relative to when they did not (adjusted OR = 2.23; 95 % CI = 1.46, 3.39).
Conclusions
Certain bicycle facilities are safer for cyclists than riding on major roads. Protected bike lanes vary in how well they shield riders from crashes and falls. Heavier separation, less frequent intersections with roads and driveways, and less complexity appear to contribute to reduced risk in protected bike lanes. Future research should systematically examine the characteristics that reduce risk in protected lanes to guide design. Planners should minimize conflict points when choosing where to place protected bike lanes and should implement countermeasures to increase visibility at these locations when they are unavoidable.}

In this study, a spatio-temporal kernel density estimation (STKDE) model, integrating spatio-temporal statistics and three-dimensional visualization techniques, was applied to reveal the spatial and temporal patterns of traffic violation behavior at urban intersections. The multivariate Gaussian kernel function was selected for space and time density estimation, as it has been shown to be a good arbitrary probability density function for continuous multivariate data. Because the STKDE model builds a space-time cube that adopts different colors of voxels to visualize the density of traffic violations, an optimal bandwidth selector that combines unconstrained pilot bandwidth matrices with a data-driven method was selected for achieving the best visualization result. The raw AES traffic violation data over 200 weekdays from 69 intersections in the city of Wujiang were empirically analyzed. The results show that the STKDE space-time cube made it easier to detect the spatio-temporal patterns of traffic violations than did the traditional hotspots map. An interesting finding was that traffic sign violations and traffic marking violations were primarily concentrated not in regular peak hours, but during the time period of 14:00-16:00, which indicates that these intersections were the most congested during this period. Primarily, the STKDE model identified seven patterns of spatio-temporal traffic violation hotspots and coldspots. These results are important because their prediction of temporal trends of traffic violations may help contribute toward the understanding and improvement of intersection safety problems.}

A 2 × 2 experimental driving simulation study was undertaken which aimed to determine the impact of signage (RIAWS versus traditional painted) and sign content (80 km/h versus slow down) on drivers’ instantaneous speed at rural intersections. The driving simulator assessment was completed by 96 drivers aged between 18 and 80 years with a current WA C class licence (passenger vehicle). This provided a total of 384 observations. The results of a two-way ANOVA found a significant interaction effect between speed signage and sign content (F(1,3) = 11.78, p < 0.001). The RIAWS “80 km/h” sign resulted in significantly lower instantaneous speeds than all other types of signs including RIAWS “slow down signs (p < 0.001), traditional painted “80 km/h” signs (p = 0.023) and traditional painted “slow down” signs (p = 0.001). Overall, the study found that RIAWS “80 km/h” sign and not the RIAWS “slow down” sign provided the most effective option for reducing driver speeds on approach to rural intersections. Further research is needed to determine the most effective placement of the RIAWS “80 km/h” signs and how they perform on curved roads.}

This study intended to focus on safety issues associated with the planning, design, and operation of signalized intersections, and identify the risk factors affecting the frequency and severity of crashes. Assuming that user behavior is influenced by the design and traffic operational characteristics of a location, this study specifically aims to investigate the effects of geometric, infrastructural, traffic control and land use parameters on the number of crashes and their severity across 52 signalized intersections of Kolkata. These data were associated with crash records from 2011 through 2014, to extract important insights, using statistical tests such as correlation analysis and independent samples t-test, as well as multivariate regression analysis for crash prediction purposes. Based on the assessments carried out in this study, there is evidence that factors such as total approach traffic volume, blocked carriageways, traffic configuration, presence of protected right turning phase, type of minor road, tram stops, etc. significantly affect the frequency of crashes while presence of all-red time, protected right turning phase, blocked carriageway, non-motorized traffic, and visibility of road markings affect the severity of crashes at signalized intersections of Kolkata. In the absence of other road traffic safety studies involving rigorous statistical analysis, these findings can significantly contribute to policy-making decisions that are aimed at improving the safety of signalized intersections in the city of Kolkata.}

abstract = {Traffic crash detection is a major component of intelligent transportation systems. It can explore inner relationships between traffic conditions and crash risk, prevent potential crashes, and improve road safety. However, there exist some limitations in current studies on crash detection: (1) The commonly used machine learning methods cannot simulate the evolving transitions of traffic conditions before crash occurrences; (2) Current models collected traffic data of only one temporal resolution, which cannot fully represent traffic trends in different time intervals. Therefore, this study proposes a Long short-term memory (LSTM) based framework considering traffic data of different temporal resolutions (LSTMDTR) for crash detection. LSTM is an effective deep learning method to capture the long-term dependency and dynamic transitions of pre-crash conditions. Three LSTM networks considering traffic data of different temporal resolutions are constructed, which can comprehensively indicate traffic variations in different time intervals. A fully-connected layer is used to combine the outputs of three LSTM networks, and a dropout layer is used to reduce overfitting and improve prediction performance. The LSTMDTR model is implemented on datasets of I880-N and I805-N in California, America. The results indicate that the LSTMDTR model can obtain satisfactory performance on crash detection, with the highest crash accuracy of 70.43 %. LSTMDTR models constructed on one freeway can be transferred to other similar freeways, with 65.12 % of crash accuracy on transferability. Compared with machine learning methods and LSTM models with one or two temporal resolutions, the LSTMDTR model has been validated to perform better on crash detection and transferability. A proper number of neurons in the LSTMDTR model should be determined in real applications considering acceptable detection performance and computation time. The dropout technique can reduce overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the LSTMDTR model, increasing crash accuracy from 64.49 % to 70.43 %.}

However, few studies in the literature deal with this topic and there are no studies modeling the total overtaking duration, i.e. the time during which extreme hazards are manifest. The present paper aims to analyze the motorcyclists’ behavior during overtaking and to model the total overtaking duration. A field experiment, using instrumented motorcycles, was performed to collect data and a survival analysis was carried out to model the total overtaking duration. Twenty young motorcyclists drove their own motorcycles, which were instrumented with a camera and a global positioning system device (GPS), onto a two-lane suburban road in Rome. A total of 101 overtaking maneuvers were recorded. A methodology, based on video and GPS analyses, was developed to obtain data describing the motorcyclists’ behavior. The obtained results showed that the mean values of the main parameters of the overtaking maneuver (total overtaking duration - 6.6 s - and distance - 109.7 m - lateral distance from the passed vehicle - 1.50 m) were consistent with the few data available in the revised literature. The total overtaking duration was modelled using a hazard-based duration model. The parametric accelerated failure time duration model with a log-logistic distribution, which was the best-fitted distribution, identified the covariates which affected, in a statistically significant way, the total overtaking duration. The obtained model revealed that the overtaking duration depends on several covariates. The greater average impact was found for the initial distance and speed difference, while the initial lateral distance and final distance produced a minor impact. When performing a multiple overtaking, the duration of the maneuver tended to increase by 31 %. This research can be considered as a pilot study and a starting point for future advances on motorcyclists’ behavior during overtaking maneuver and for modeling the total overtaking duration. In addition, the findings of this study could contribute to the development of advanced rider assistance systems for the overtaking maneuver based on current driving conditions.}

Penalty point and fine strategies are often used in parallel. Different degrees of penalty points and/or fines are imposed according to the specific violation behavior of drivers. However, the question of whether each penalty produces positive effects in maintaining a driver’s compliance with traffic regulations and promoting the driver’s traffic safety is still unanswered. This study focuses on quantifying the effects of penalty point and fine strategies on violation recurrences and accident occurrences of drivers. A frailty survival analysis method is conducted to jointly model the occurrence of violation and accident events of each individual. The frailty term in the model is leveraged to address the unobserved heterogeneity among drivers. Personal characteristics and penalty status are also incorporated as covariates in the model. Actual violation and accident data from a province in China are utilized to calibrate the model. The results show that penalty point strategy exhibits deterrent and binding effects; however, penalty fine strategy does not show the expected effects. The number of years of driving is also a significant factor that influences violation recurrence and accident occurrence. The present study provides insightful information for improving violation penalty mechanisms.}

The analysis uses crash data from the state of Ohio between 2011 and 2015 available from the Highway Safety Information System. To determine if weather conditions should be considered separately for truck safety analyses, parameter transferability tests are conducted; the results suggest that weather conditions should be modeled separately with a high level of statistical confidence. To this end, three separate mixed logit models are estimated for three different weather conditions: normal, rain and snow. The estimated models identify a variety of statistically significant factors influencing the injury severity. Different weather conditions are found to have different contributing effects on injury severity in truck-involved crashes. Rural, rear-end and sideswipe crash parameters were found to have significantly different levels of impact on injury severity. Based on the findings of this study, several countermeasures are suggested: 1) safety and enforcement programs should focus on female truck drivers, 2) a variable speed limit sign should be used to lower speeds of trucks during rainy condition, and 3) trucks should be restricted or prohibited on non-interstates during rainy and snowy conditions. These countermeasures could reduce the number and severity of truck-involved crashes under different weather conditions.}

This work shows that this is not always the case when considering pedestrian fatalities. Given the unavoidable uncertainty in vehicle motion, environmental parameters, and pedestrian behavior, emergency avoidance maneuvers often involve some chance of a collision. Maneuvers that aim to keep the vehicle as far away from the pedestrian as possible will theoretically minimize collisions; but if this strategy is followed and a collision occurs nonetheless, it will often be at a higher speed than would occur with alternative strategies. This is a result of the tires’ friction ellipse which enforces a constraint between steering versus braking; for collision avoidance, braking must be reduced if pedestrian clearance is to be maximized. This work shows that in some common pedestrian collision situations, the net effect of this increase in vehicle speed for pure avoidance offsets the benefits of reducing collisions. Pedestrians, if hit, would be hit at higher speeds leading to a net reduction in pedestrian survivability for collision-minimizing maneuvers. First, this trend is demonstrated and explained using a simplified point-mass model of a vehicle, which is then verified with a higher-fidelity vehicle model as well as experimental maneuvers with an instrumented vehicle. While real accidents involve dozens of important parameters, this research provides a general framework for an under-recognized effect under certain common conditions. The implication of this finding suggests that future research in pedestrian avoidance should consider fatality minimization as an alternative objective to collision minimization.}

To promote wider use of the systemic safety approach, this paper aims at developing and validating a procedure to rank unsignalised urban intersections for safety improvement based on the evaluation of risk factors by road safety inspections. The procedure assesses a Safety Index (SI) that measures the safety performance of unsignalised urban intersections. The SI is formulated by combining two components of risk: the exposure of road users to road hazards (Exposure) and the risk factors, which increase the probability of involvement in crashes (Risk Index). The SI is made of two elements, one related to vehicles and one to pedestrians. Twenty-three detailed safety issues and ten general safety issues are assessed to compute the vehicle Risk Index and the pedestrian Risk Index. Safety issues were selected considering that they are common issues and that effective remedial measures exist and have already proven their effectiveness. Finally, criteria for identifying and ranking safety issues were defined. The SI has two main practical applications. High risk intersections, where safety measures that can reduce crash frequency exist, can be identified and ranked by the SI. Specific safety issues, that give more contribution to unsafety, are pointed out in order to give indication about more appropriate safety measures according to the systemic safety approach. The procedure was validated with a sample of eighty-nine urban intersections located in Orange County (Florida, U.S.). For these intersections, the SI scores, the Empirical Bayes (EB) safety estimates, and the potential for improvement (PFI) were compared. The correlation between the SI scores and the EB estimates was highly significant both for vehicles (R2 = 0.66) and pedestrians (R2 = 0.58) as well as for the total crashes (R2 = 0.68). The results from the Spearman's rank-correlation analysis provided further validation for the SI indicating that ranking from the SI and the EB estimates agree at the 99.9% confidence level for vehicles (ρs = 0.78), pedestrians (ρs = 0.93), and total (ρs = 0.93).}

abstract = {This study investigates the traffic conflict risks at the upstream approach of toll plaza during the vehicles’ diverging period from the time of arrival at the diverging area to that of entering the tollbooths. Based on the vehicle’s trajectory data extracted from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) videos using an automated video analysis system, vehicles’ collision risk is computed by extended time to collision (TTC). Then, two time-varying mixed logit models including time-varying random effects logistic regression (T-RELR) model and time-varying random parameters logistic regression (T-RPLR) are developed to examine the time varying effects of influencing factors on vehicle collision risk, and four models including the standard random effects logistic regression (S-RELR) model, standard random parameters logistic regression (S-RPLR) model, distance-varying random effects logistic regression (D-RELR) model and distance-varying random parameters logistic regression (D-RPLR) are developed for model performance comparison. The results indicate that the T-RPLR model has the highest prediction accuracy. Eight influencing factors including following vehicle’s travel distance, following vehicle’s initial lane, following vehicle’s toll collection type, leading vehicle’s toll collection type, distance between two vehicles’ centroids, and following vehicle’s speed, are found to have time-varying effects on collision risk. Meanwhile, the first six factors are found to exhibit heterogeneous effects over the travel time. Another important finding is that the vehicle that comes from the innermost lane has an increasing trend to be involved in traffic conflicts, whereas the collision risks of other vehicles decrease as the travel time increases. Moreover, vehicles with higher speed have a decreasing probability to be involved in crashes over the travel time. Interestingly, the results of D-RPLR model are similar with that of T-RPLR model. These findings provide helpful information for accurate assessment of collision risk, which is a key step toward improving safety performance of the toll plazas’ diverging areas.}

Existing crash prediction models can be transferred if calibrated, but the current aggregate calibration method limits prediction accuracy and the disaggregate method is resource-consuming. Transfer learning is another approach to calibration that acquires knowledge from old data domains to solve problems in new data domains. An instance-based transfer learning technique, TrAdaBoost.R2, is adopted in this study since it meets the requirement of site-based crash prediction model transfer. TrAdaBoost.R2 was compared with AdaBoost.R2 using a simply pooled data set to examine the efficiency in extracting knowledge from a spatially outdated source data domain (old data domain). The target data domain (new data domain) was sampled to test the technique’s adaptability to small sample size. The calibration factor method based on a negative binomial model was employed to compare its predictive performance with that of the transfer learning technique. Mean square error was calculated to evaluate the prediction accuracy. Two cities in China, Shanghai and Guangzhou, were taken mutually as source data domain and target data domain. Results showed that the models constructed with TrAdaBoost.R2 had better prediction accuracy than the conventional calibration method. The TrAdaBoost.R2 is recommended due to its predictive performance and adaptability to small sample size. Crash prediction models are proposed to construct for peak and off-peak hours separately.}

Current Australian drivers aged over 60 years (N = 258) responded to a self-report questionnaire. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated increased use of tactical behaviours were associated with greater driving difficulty, more readiness to change and male gender (R2 = 23.2%) . These effects were moderated by a significant association between readiness to change, driving modifications for health reasons and age (R2chg = 2.9%). Greater readiness to change was associated with increased use of tactical behaviours for older drivers who did not modify driving for health reasons, independent of ageIndependent of age. This association was also found for younger old drivers with health difficulties, but not for older old drivers with health difficulties. Hierarchical regression indicated that greater readiness to change, increased driving difficulty, female gender and modification of driving for health reasons were associated with reports of increased strategic self-regulation (R2 = 50.8%). These effects were moderated by readiness to change and age, and readiness to change and gender (R2chg = 2.1%). The association between readiness to change and strategic self-regulation was stronger for women than men, and the strength of this association became substantially stronger with increasing age. It was concluded that readiness to change driving behaviour may promote different forms of driving self-regulation for different individuals, and that older drivers may use the different forms of driving self-regulation independently of one another.}

These road areas may be classified as urban or rural and evince obvious differences such as speed limits, number of intersections, vehicle types, etc. However, no study comparing rear-end crashes occurring in urban and rural areas has yet been conducted. Therefore, the present investigation focused on the comparison of diverse factors affecting the likelihood of rear-end crash severities in the two types of roadways. Additionally, hierarchical logistic models grounded in a spatial basis concept were applied by determining varying parameter estimations with regard to road segments. Additionally, the study compared coefficients with multilevel correlation model and those without multilevel correlation. Four models were established as a result. The data used for the study pertained to rear-end crashes occurring on Thai highways between 2011 and 2015. The results of the data analysis revealed that the model parameters for both urban and rural areas are in the same direction with the larger number of significant parameter values present in the rural rear-end crash model. The significant variables in both the urban and rural road segment models are the seat belt use, and the time of the incident. To conclude, the present study is useful because it provides another perspective of rear-end crashes to encourage policy makers to apply decisions that favor rules that assure safety.}

Threat-assessment and decision-making algorithms for FCW and AEB aim to find the best compromise for safety by intervening at the “right” time: neither too early, potentially upsetting the driver, nor too late, possibly missing opportunities to avoid the collision. Today, the extent to which activation times for FCW and AEB should depend on factors such as pedestrian speed and lane width is unknown. To guide the design of FCW and AEB intervention time, we employed a fractional factorial design, and determined how seven factors (crossing side, car speed, pedestrian speed, crossing angle, pedestrian size, zebra-crossing presence, and lane width) affect the driver’s response process and comfort zone when negotiating an intersection with a pedestrian. Ninety-four volunteers drove through an intersection in a fixed-base driving simulator, which was based on open-source software (OpenDS). Several parameters, including pedestrian time-to-arrival and driver response time, were calculated to describe the driver response process and define driver comfort boundaries. Linear mixed-effect models showed that driver responses depended mainly on pedestrian time-to-arrival and visibility, whereas factors such as pedestrian size, zebra-crossing presence, and lane width did not significantly influence the driver response process. Drivers released the accelerator pedal in 99.8 % of the trials and braked in 89 % of the trials. Forty-six percent of the drivers changed their negotiation strategy (proportion of pedal braking to engine braking) to minimize driving effort over the course of the experiment. In fact, 51 % of the of the inexperienced drivers changed their response strategy whereas only 40 % of the experienced drivers did; nevertheless, all drivers behaved similarly, independent of driving experience. The flexible and customizable driving environment provided by OpenDS may be a viable platform for behavioural experiments in driving simulators. Results from this study suggest that visibility and pedestrian time-to-arrival are the most important variables for defining the earliest acceptable FCW and AEB activations. Fractional factorial design effectively compared the influence of seven factors on driver behaviour within a single experiment; however, this design did not allow in-depth data analysis. In the future, OpenDS might become a standard platform, enabling crowdsourcing and favouring repeatability across studies in traffic safety. Finally, this study advises future design and evaluation procedures (e.g. new car assessment programs) for FCW and AEB by highlighting which factors deserve further investigation and which ones do not.}

Crash risk factors are important to understand in order to improve safety and increase cycling uptake. Many studies of cycling crash risk are based on combining diverse sources of crash and exposure data, such as police databases (crashes) and travel surveys (exposure), based on shared geography and time. When conflating crash and exposure data from different sources, the risk factors that can be quantified are only those variables common to both datasets, which tend to be limited to geography (e.g. countries, provinces, municipalities) and a few general road user characteristics (e.g. gender and age strata). The Physical Activity through Sustainable Transport Approaches (PASTA) project was a prospective cohort study that collected both crash and exposure data from seven European cities (Antwerp, Barcelona, London, Örebro, Rome, Vienna and Zürich). The goal of this research was to use data from the PASTA project to quantify exposure-adjusted crash rates and model adjusted crash risk factors, including detailed sociodemographic characteristics, attitudes about transportation, neighbourhood built environment features and location by city. We used negative binomial regression to model the influence of risk factors independent of exposure. Of the 4,180 cyclists, 10.2 % reported 535 crashes. We found that overall crash rates were 6.7 times higher in London, the city with the highest crash rate, relative to Örebro, the city with the lowest rate. Differences in overall crash rates between cities are driven largely by crashes that did not require medical treatment and that involved motor-vehicles. In a parsimonious crash risk model, we found higher crash risks for less frequent cyclists, men, those who perceive cycling to not be well regarded in their neighbourhood, and those who live in areas of very high building density. Longitudinal collection of crash and exposure data can provide important insights into individual differences in crash risk. Substantial differences in crash risks between cities, neighbourhoods and population groups suggest there is great potential for improvement in cycling safety.}

abstract = {Traffic congestion is more likely to lead to aggressive driving behavior that is associated with increased crash risks. Previous studies mainly focus on driving behavior during congestion when studying congestion effects. However, the negative effects of congestion on driving behavior may also affect drivers’ post-congestion driving. To fill this research gap, this study examined the influence of traffic congestion on driver behavior on the post-congestion roads (i.e., the roads travelled right after congestion). Twenty-five subjects participated in a driving simulation study. They were asked to complete two trials corresponding to post-congestion and non-congestion conditions, respectively. Driver behavior quantified by driving performance measures, eye movement measures, and electroencephalogram (EEG) measures was compared between the two conditions. Ten features were selected from the measures with statistical significance. The selected features were integrated to characterize drivers’ response patterns using a hierarchical clustering method. The results showed that driver behavior in post-congestion situations became more aggressive, more focused in the forward area but less focused in the dashboard area, and was associated with lower power of the β-band in the temporal brain region. The clustering results showed more aggressive and lack-of-aware response patterns while driving in post-congestion situations. This study revealed that traffic congestion negatively affected driver behavior on the post-congestion roads. Practical implications for driving safety education was discussed based on the findings from the present study.}

abstract = {Traffic accidents are becoming a significant cause for unnatural deaths around the world, with more than 1.25 million fatalities in road accidents each year, and over 20 million people severely injured. A large portion of accidents that result in fatalities involve interaction between vehicles and pedestrians. In the literature, researchers speculate on a wide range of reasons for these figures. This paper focuses on the relationship between pedestrians’ urgency to cross a busy road and the resulting level of risk for an accident. The probability for an accident is determined by a prediction model for a collision between drivers and pedestrians at congested conflict spots. The model is based on a motion planner called the Probabilistic Navigation Function (PNF), initially designed for robot navigation in dynamic cluttered and uncertain environments. The model predicts pedestrians’ trajectories when crossing a busy road in a sub-meter accuracy, based on the risk they are willing to take (a reflection of the level of urgency to cross the road). The paper describes an unexpected and surprising pedestrian behavior in simple road crossings scenarios. When the model is given a loose risk boundary (that reflects a high level of pedestrian urgency to cross), the resulting trajectory exposes the pedestrian to a lower risk compared with a trajectory constructed with a strict risk boundary (that reflects a more conservative pedestrian). This is equivalent to claiming that, paradoxically, pedestrians in some scenarios who are willing to take higher levels of risk, face a decreased probability for an accident while crossing a congested road. The paper introduces the PNF model for crossing pedestrians, analyses their performance in a set of simulations, and explains its rationale. Next, an analytic estimation for the risk level as a function of the crossing angle of the selected trajectory is provided. A series of experiments conclude the paper and support the claim that this phenomenon is frequent among crossing pedestrians. The experimental results suggest that in some common scenarios, more cautious pedestrians may lower the initial risk for an accident at the expense of a total higher risk for an accident during the entire road crossing process, compared with a pedestrian who takes an initial higher level of risk that results in, overall, a decreased probability for an accident. A statistical analysis implies that there are significant differences in this occurrence between adults and children.}

The prognosis of post-traumatic headache is poorly understood.
Objective
To develop and validate a prognostic model to predict the presence of post-traumatic headache six months after a traffic collision in adults with incident post-traumatic headache.
Design
Secondary analyses of adults with incident post-traumatic headache injured in traffic collisions between November 1997 and December 1999 in Saskatchewan, Canada (development cohort); and between January 2004 and January 2005 in Sweden (validation cohort).
Setting
The Saskatchewan cohort (development) was population-based (N = 4162). The Swedish cohort (validation) (N = 379) were claimants from two insurance companies covering 20 % of cars driven in Sweden in 2004.
Participants
All adults injured in traffic collisions who completed a baseline questionnaire within 30 days of collision. Excluded were those hospitalized >2 days, lost consciousness >30 min, or reported headache <3/10 on the numerical rating scale. Follow-up rates for both cohorts were approximately 80 %.
Predictors
Baseline sociodemographic, pre-injury, and injury factors.
Outcome
Self-reported headache pain intensity ≥3 (numerical rating scale) six months after injury.
Results
Both cohorts were predominantly female (69.7 % in Saskatchewan, 65.2 % in Sweden), with median ages 35.9 years (Saskatchewan), and 38.0 years (Sweden). Predictors were age, work status, headache pain intensity, symptoms in arms or hands, dizziness or unsteadiness, stiffness in neck, pre-existing headache, and lower recovery expectations. With a positive score (i.e., ≥0.75 probability), the model can rule in the presence of post-traumatic headache at six months (development: specificity = 99.8 %, 95 % CI 99.5 %–99.9 %; sensitivity = 1.6 %, 95 % CI 1.0 %–2.6 %; positive likelihood ratio (LR+) = 8.0, 95 % CI 2.7−24.1; negative likelihood ratio (LR-) = 1.0, 95 % CI 1.0−1.0; validation: specificity = 95.5 %, 95 % CI 91.1 %–97.8 %; sensitivity = 27.2 %, 95 % CI 20.4 %–35.2 %); LR+ = 6.0, 95 % CI 2.8−13.2; LR- = 0.8, 95 % CI 0.7−0.8).
Conclusions and relevance
Clinicians can collect patient information on the eight predictors of our model to identify patients that will report ongoing post-traumatic headache six months after a traffic collision. Future research should focus on selecting patients at high risk of poor outcomes (using our model) for inclusion in intervention studies, and determining effective interventions for these patients.}

However, the entrance and exit parts of a tunnel are mostly considered symmetrical in previous studies, and the different lengths (long, medium, and short) of tunnels have not been separately studied. This study aims to investigate the characteristics of traffic crashes in freeway single tunnels by separately considering the entrance and exit of the tunnel as well as the different lengths of tunnels. A six-zone approach is proposed, and the data from 156 single tunnels in Hunan province, China, are applied for safety analysis. The crash rate, crash type, and contributing crash factors are compared between the conventional four-zone approach and the proposed method, and the three types of tunnels with different lengths are also compared for in-depth analysis. Results show that the proposed six-zone method provides a better understanding of the tunnels crash characteristics. The most crash-prone zones for long, medium, and short tunnels are the mid-zone, the entrance zone, and the access zone, respectively. Furthermore, at the tunnel entrance, drivers usually fail to maintain safe distance, which results in the high proportion of rear-end crashes, while at the tunnel exit, they do speeding and improper lane change that increases the risk of sideswipe, rollover, and collision with fixed objects. The study also discusses the crash occurrence mechanism for different types of tunnels. Findings of this study shed some light on the engineering and policy implications for improving traffic safety of the freeway tunnels.}

The complexity of the task depends on several factors, but this research focuses on work zone configurations and their effect on driver performance and gaze behavior. The increase in work zone fatalities in the United States between 2015 and 2018 coupled with the limited literature of driver behavior in these complex environments requires a more comprehensive study. Given the nature of these crashes, typically lane departures, gaze behavior provided an additional physiological dimension to the present research. A framework that comprises of the interactions between driver characteristics, mental workload, and situation awareness, with longitudinal control, lateral control, and gaze behavior is proposed. Crash analysis and a simulator study with 90 participants were carried out to investigate the performance and gaze-based changes with respect to various work zone configurations. Distracted driving was also studied by including a secondary task. The results showed a significant interaction between the longitudinal control and the standard deviation of horizontal gaze position in predicting lateral control. Also, significant differences in lateral control and horizontal gaze variations were observed between genders. Female drivers showed lower lateral position deviations and lower horizontal gaze variability. This was a key finding given the inherently higher number of work zone crashes involving male drivers. Placing work zone barriers further away, by up to one meter from pavement edges, could significantly decrease mental workload and improve safety in work zones.}

Excessive alcohol use, especially binge drinking, is an important risk factor for unintentional and intentional injuries. This study used hospital discharge data (HDD) to estimate the prevalence and trends of treatments for alcohol-related injury (ARI) in Minnesota, and discussed opportunities and challenges for public health surveillance.
Method
We examined hospital-treated ARI in Minnesota between 2000 and 2015 using HDD (age ≥12 years). ARI was defined as hospital discharges with an injury diagnosis and a diagnosis related to alcohol in any diagnosis field.
Results
The number of hospital-treated injuries increased by 30 % between 2000 and 2015. The number of those injuries that were alcohol-related increased by 166 % from 2000 to 2015. ARI were more likely to be treated as inpatients than all injuries—in 2015, 34 % of ARI were inpatient, compared to 17 % of all injuries. Patients treated for ARI were more likely to be male and older than the average injury patient. In 2015, ARI were more likely than all injuries to be self-inflicted (11.6 % vs. 1.9 %), related to assault (14.4 % vs. 3.6 %), and less likely to be unintentional (63.8 % vs. 78.5 %).
Conclusions
These analyses suggest that the rate of hospital-treated ARI increased more steeply from 2000 to 2015 than all injuries. While there are significant challenges to using HDD for surveillance, further work to assess the validity of the data source is warranted.}

Previous research has investigated this manoeuvre in different experimental environments, including naturalistic driving, naturalistic cycling, and simulator studies. These studies highlight the significance of oncoming traffic—but did not extensively examine the influence of the cyclist’s position within the lane. In this study, we performed a test-track experiment to investigate how oncoming traffic and position of the cyclist within the lane influence overtaking. Participants overtook a robot cyclist, which was controlled to ride in two different lateral positions within the lane. At the same time, an oncoming robot vehicle was controlled to meet the participant’s vehicle with either 6 or 9 s time-to-collision. The order of scenarios was randomised over participants. We analysed safety metrics for the four different overtaking phases, reflecting drivers’ safety margins to rear-end, head-on, and side-swipe collisions, in order to investigate the two binary factors: 1) time gap between ego vehicle and oncoming vehicle, and 2) cyclist lateral position. Finally, the effects of these two factors on the safety metrics and the overtaking strategy (either flying or accelerative depending on whether the overtaking happened before or after the oncoming vehicle had passed) were analysed. The results showed that, both when the cyclist rode closer to the centre of the lane and when the time gap to the oncoming vehicle was shorter, safety margins for all potential collisions decreased. Under these conditions, drivers—particularly female drivers—preferred accelerative over flying manoeuvres. Bayesian statistics modelled these results to inform the development of active safety systems that can support drivers in safely overtaking cyclists.}

abstract = {Background
Urban planners frequently neglect the role of subjective risk perception during urban cycling. Several findings suggest a complex relationship between the risk of being involved in a crash and the subjective anticipation of this risk.
Data collection and methods
We investigate the relation of objective risks (operationalized through crashes involving cyclists) and subjective risk perception (operationalized through citizens’ reports in a crowdsourcing project) in a medium-sized German city. Using GIS methods, these datasets are linked to various infrastructure and traffic properties that have been found relevant for cycling safety.
Results
Despite a generally high alignment of objective and subjective risk, our findings highlight that the subjective risk perception at a given location can deviate significantly from the actual crash risk. For example, the subjective perception of high risk on one-way streets with bikeways in opposing direction is not matched by a high level of objective risk. Vice versa, some rather dangerous situations (e.g., tram stops) are not perceived as particularly dangerous.
Conclusions
Understanding why and where cyclists over- or underestimate the actual crash risk may provide a foundation for the design of safer cycling infrastructures, as well as for promoting cycling as a comfortable mode of transportation.}

This investigation has shown that accidents due to the traffic represent around 50 % of the total number of accidents every year. Among them, rear-end collisions hold a 20 % share. These numbers display the fact that the interaction between drivers can be held responsible of those incidents. In this respect, we have explored the reasons behind the conflict situations that may be responsible of the occurrence of rear-end collisions by the mean of a cognitive psychology based cellular automata model. Indeed, through field experiments performed by an embedded camera, we have extricated a psychological cognitive process of anticipation. We have defined the latter as the tendency of drivers to accelerate based on the history of their predecessor. Then, we have exploited the tools of the physics of traffic by which we have developed a CA-model that take into consideration this process. As a result, we were able to generate those incidents’ situations. By considering two types of drivers: conservative who respect the learned information about the safe manoeuvres but make mistakes or aggressive who violate those secure processes, we have proved the complexity of the relationship between the states of the traffic flow and the drivers’ behaviours. In fact, we have shown that rear-end collisions are a result of the anticipation as a response of the drivers to the traffic conditions: the congestion. Moreover, we have also highlighted an improvement of the flow in the congested state up to 11 % due to the anticipation, but that can only be achieved through vehicle-to-vehicle communication. Finally, we have investigated the hot spots. We have found that the traffic perturbations, that generate those hot spots and can be responsible of collisions, are more likely to be located away in the downstream direction. The distance between the two locations depends on the traffic density. This difference between the positions of the traffic perturbation and the hot spot has showcased the complexity, in time and space, of the transmission and the reception of deceleration information by the drivers.}

The illumination level and size of the GPS display may influence the duration and frequency of a driver’s glances, which in turn may affect driver distraction. In a simulated driving experiment requiring the use of a GPS, the GPS’s display size and illumination level were examined, in light of the driver’s experience and gender, to understand their effects on the performance and safety of young drivers on roads in urban and rural areas. Twenty young subjects, male and female between the ages of 18 and 29 years, participated in this experiment. Driving safety was evaluated by lateral control (number of pavement and lane line crossings), number of crashes, number of near misses, and the total time out of the lane. Driving performance was evaluated by the number of navigational errors, the total time making navigational errors, number of times the speed limit was exceeded and total amount of time speeding. These measures were analyzed using a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) model. Furthermore, the effects of the GPS display, considering the driving experience, were investigated with a simple linear regression. Findings suggest that driving with a small GPS display in an urban area leads to more navigational errors than driving with a large GPS display. Furthermore, more speed limit violations tend to occur in rural areas in the daytime than at night. Moreover, in urban areas, male drivers tend to have the highest number of crashes during the daytime. Furthermore, in rural areas, males tend to violate the speed limit more often and for longer periods of time during the daytime than at night and more than females do. Additionally, when navigating with a GPS system, young experienced drivers drive safer than inexperience drivers. The findings are of interest to designers and transportation researchers concerned with improving GPSs to enhance driving safety and performance.}

Pedestrians from mainland China (which has a right-side driving (RD) system) and Hong Kong (which has a left-side driving (LD) system) were studied. Significant differences were observed between pedestrians from the different locations in terms of the direction in which the pedestrians habitually first looked before crossing. When exposed to an unfamiliar driving rule (i.e., traffic coming from an inconsistent direction in terms of participants’ habitual driving system), the odds of participants from mainland China making an error in their looking behavior were 2.93 times those when exposed to a familiar driving rule. Road markings and traffic sound did not improve these participants’ looking behavior. The results also show a negative correlation between inattentive looking behavior and time to collision (significant at the 1% level), as these errors lead to a shorter time to collision and increased the risk to pedestrians. The results of this study confirmed the risks for pedestrians traveling to places with unfamiliar driving rules and confirmed the existence of habitual looking behavior, and therefore provide evidence of the need for future studies to improve this problem. These may help decision makers take the risks of pedestrians from different driving rules into consideration in future traffic policymaking or traffic-facility improvements. The use of a VR simulation-based approach in this study provided a safe and controllable way to trial interventions and potential improvements without risking injury to participants, and thus may also be used for similar future studies.}

A binary logistic regression model was developed in this study by using the collected data. Results of the developed model showed that seven statistically significant factors strongly influenced pedestrians’ decision to cross the road by rolling gap crossing at intersections.

keywords = {Driving exposure, Age category, Gender, Time-of-crash, American Time Use Survey},
abstract = {Background
The use of an appropriate driving exposure measure is essential to calculate traffic crash rates and risks. Commonly used exposure measures include driving distance and the number of licensed drivers. These measures have some limitations, including the unavailability of disaggregated estimates for consecutive years, low data quality, and the failure to represent the driving population when the crash occurred. However, the length of driving time, available annually from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), can be disaggregated by age, gender, time-of-day, and day-of week, and addresses the temporal discontinuity limitation of driving distance on the United States (U.S.) national scale.
Objectives
The objective of this study is to determine if the length of driving time as a driving exposure measure is comparable to driving distance by comparing distance-based and time-based fatal crash risk ratios by driver age category, gender, time-of-day, and day-of-week.
Methods
The 2016–2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) provided driving distance, and 2016–2017 Fatality Analysis Reporting System provided the number of drivers in fatal crashes. The distributions of driving distance and length of driving time by driver age category (16−24, 25−44, 45−64, and 65 years or older), gender, time-of-day, day-of-week were compared. Two negative binomial regression models were used to compute the distance-based and time-based fatal crash risk ratios.
Results
The distributions of driving-distance were not different from the length-of-driving-time distributions by driver age category, gender, time-of-day, and day-of-week. Driving distance and the length of driving time provide similar fatal crash risk ratio estimates.
Conclusions
The length of driving time can be an alternative to driving distance as a measure of driving exposure. The primary advantage of driving time over driving distance is that, starting from 2003, the disaggregated estimates of the length of driving time are available from ATUS over consecutive years, curtailing the discontinuity limitation of driving distance. Furthermore, the length of driving time is related to drivers’ perceived risks about their driving conditions and as a result, may be a better exposure measure than driving distance in comparing crash risks between drivers whose likelihood of traveling in hazardous driving conditions (e.g., nighttime) varies substantially.}

abstract = {Many road authorities in Canada have been contemplating the use of wider longitudinal pavement markings (LPMs) to enhance road safety and driver comfort. However, conclusive evidence on the safety impacts of wider LPMs has not been available. To address this gap in the literature, this study was conducted to investigate the safety impacts of wider LPMs. The study adopted the Full Bayes approach to conduct a before and after safety evaluation, using data collected from 38 treatment sites (highway segments) from three Canadian jurisdictions (i.e., British Columbia, Alberta, and Quebec). Collision and traffic data were obtained from the 38 sites over a period of eight years (2008–2015). The widths of LPMs at all sites were increased between 2012 and 2013, which enables a before and after safety evaluation to investigate the impact of the wider markings on the collision frequency. The results showed an overall significant reduction in both total collisions and target collisions (i.e., run-off-the-road collisions) by 12.3 % and 19.0 %, respectively, after implementing the wider LPMs. Total collisions were reduced by 11.1 %, 27.5 %, and 1.1 % in Alberta, British Columbia, and Quebec, respectively. Similarly, a reduction in the run-off-the-road collisions that ranged between 22.7 % and 28.9 % were observed in the three jurisdictions. The results suggest that wider longitudinal pavement markings can reduce collisions and improve safety on Canadian highways. As such, road authorities should consider using this intervention to enhance road safety, particularly, at locations that experience a high frequency of run-off-the-road collisions.}

This study investigates the different relationships between safety stressors (safety role ambiguity, safety role conflict, and interpersonal safety conflict) and two forms of SCB (proactive and prosocial). It also examines the moderating effect of safety-specific trust (cognition- and affect-based) within these relationships. An analysis of 332 multisource data from frontline workers and their safety supervisors in China reveals that safety role ambiguity and safety role conflict negatively affect proactive safety behaviors, while interpersonal safety conflict impedes prosocial safety behaviors. Additionally, cognition-based safety trust alleviates the effects of safety role ambiguity and safety role conflict on proactive safety behaviors, whereas affect-based safety trust effectively restricts the influence of interpersonal safety conflict on prosocial safety behaviors. These results suggest that managers need to instill SCB in their subordinates and combat stressful conditions through interventions that enhance safety-specific trust.}

abstract = {This study estimates how many additional cyclist accidents, injuries or fatalities are avoided or mitigated by adding a system which increases braking levels, the Torricelli Vacuum Emergency Brake (VEB), to a state-of-the-art Automated Emergency Braking (AEB) system. To obtain a realistic state-of-the-art AEB system, the AEB parameter settings were defined to fulfil but not exceed the performance necessary to achieve a full score in the European New Car Assessment Program (Euro NCAP). The systems are simulated in a simple but realistic simulation model in MATLAB with varying brake deceleration and sensor field-of-view (FoV). This study utilised data from the German In-Depth Accident Study (GIDAS), released in January 2019, and the related Pre-Crash Matrix (PCM), released in February 2019. Cyclist Injury Risk Curves were created from 2,662 GIDAS accidents involving a passenger car and a cyclist. The sample of cyclist accidents from the GIDAS-PCM database used in the final simulations comprised 1,340 collisions between the front of a passenger car and a cyclist. Both data samples were weighted to be representative of Germany as a whole. Adding the VEB was found to avoid over 20% more accidents than the AEB alone. Although increasing the FoV from 75° to 180° for the AEB system increases its accident avoidance rate to a level comparable to the VEB, the VEB remains about 8–20% more effective in reducing fatalities and injuries, and thus offers greater safety benefits than simply increasing AEB FoV. While the initial accidents in the representative simulation sample are fairly evenly distributed over the vehicle front, the remaining accidents (those that cannot be prevented by AEB or VEB) are more concentrated at the vehicle corners and are further characterized by high cyclist speeds. High cyclist speeds and impact to the vehicle corners potentially increase the relative frequency of head impacts to the stiff A-pillars. We therefore recommend that, for passenger cars, VEB and other advanced AEB systems should be combined with in-crash protection, especially in the A-pillar area, to best protect cyclists from injury.}

Risk perception studies use a range of techniques from on-road data collection to ratings of still photos, however participants’ ratings differ depending on the study methodology, possibly due to their perception of control. To explore this we conducted a multiple methods study to investigate drivers’ perceptions of risk on rural roads. One group of participants drove (Drivers, n = 13) a 180 km route along rural roads (accompanied by a research assistant) and provided verbal risk ratings at thirteen locations of interest. A second group (Passengers, n = 10) provided ratings at the same points when travelling as a passenger in a vehicle (driven by a research assistant). The third group (Observers, n = 14) were shown videos of the same rural roads (filmed from the drivers’ perspective) and also provided risk ratings at the same locations. A week later participants were invited to the laboratory to review the video footage and comment on factors that contributed to the risk ratings. Overall, the Observers gave the highest risk ratings and Drivers the lowest. The Observers also provided twice the number of comments to justify their risk rating compared to the other two groups. The results suggest that control, and on-road experience play a significant role in how perceptions of driving risk are formed and the degree of risk experienced. These findings also bring into question the accuracy of using video-based tasks to assess drivers’ risk perception (and speed choice), particularly if the findings are used to inform on-road safety interventions.}

The five factors identified for the model were: Noncommitment, Monitoring, Feedback, Communication, and Modeling. Further, invariance testing revealed that the five-factor model fit equally well for males and females.

Each test included two hazard events: 1) pedestrians crossing a road and 2) parked vehicles merging into a roadway. Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) and Sleepiness Symptoms Questionnaire (SSQ) ratings were also recorded during each drive. Four separate models using parametric accelerated failure time (AFT) with Weibull distribution were developed for RT and TBT in the two events. The models were chosen with clustered heterogeneity to account for intra-group heterogeneity due to repeated measures across tests. In the case of pedestrians crossing event, RT increased by 10% in the first test session and no significant effect observed on RT in the second test session. The overall TBT reduced by 25% and 28% during the first and second PSD sessions, respectively. In the case of vehicle merging event, both response time and total braking time delayed by 44% and 17% respectively after PSD. Other factors such as age, experience, work-rest hours, KSS and SSQ rating, often exercising, approaching speed and braking force were also found significant in the analysis.

abstract = {Background
Many states have legalized casino gambling, and casinos create increased vehicle traffic, but the strength of the association between casino construction and vehicle crashes is unknown.
Methods
Retrospective analyses of motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) occurring within Anne Arundel County, Maryland (2010–2014) were conducted. The ratio of crashes within one mile of the casino’s location after it was opened were compared to the ratio occurring in the same area before it was opened to determine how the incidence of MVCs near the casino changed with time. Logistic regression was used to determine how crash characteristics may have influenced the incidence of MVCs near the casino after it opened.
Results
101,860 persons were involved in 43,328 MVCs in Anne Arundel County during the study period; 29,476 (68.0 %) had an at-fault driver ≥21 years of age and complete data. MVCs proximal to the casino occurred most commonly during the day (N = 421, 76.6 %) and involved drivers <40 years of age (N = 366, 66.6 %) and male (N = 316, 57.4 %). After adjustment for impairment and day of the week, there was a significant association with crashes close to the casino after it opened (ORAdjusted = 1.23, 95 % CI: 1.04–1.46, p = 0.02). Crashes occurring close to the casino, after it opened, involved drivers <40 years of age (OR = 1.74, 95 % CI:1.45–2.08) and occurred on weekends (OR = 1.39, 95 %CI:1.15–1.67).
Conclusions
In this single-site study the opening of a casino was associated with an increase in crashes nearby. The generalizability of this finding should be confirmed with analysis of MVC data near other gambling venues.}

abstract = {Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) technology, although in the development stage, is quickly expanding throughout the vehicle market. However, full market penetration will most likely require considerable planning as key stakeholders, manufacturers, consumers and governing agencies work together to determine optimal deployment strategies. Specifically, road safety is a critical challenge to the widespread deployment and adoption of this disruptive technology. During the transition period fleets will be composed of a combination of CAVs and conventional vehicles, and therefore it is imperative to investigate the repercussions of CAVs on traffic safety at different penetration rates. Since crash severity and frequency in conjunction reflect traffic safety, this study attempts to investigate the effect of CAVs on both crash severity and frequency through a microsimulation modelling exercise. VISSM microsimulation platform is used to simulate a case study of the M1 Geelong Ring Road network (Princes Freeway) in Victoria, Australia. Network performance is evaluated using performance metrics (Total System Travel Time, Delay) and kinematic variables (Speed, acceleration, jerk rate). Surrogate safety measures (time to collision, post encroachment time, etc.) are examined to inspect the safety in the network. The results indicate that the introduction of CAVs does not achieve the expected decrease in crash severity and rates involving manual vehicles, despite the improvement in network performance, given the demand and the set of parameters used in our operational CAV algorithm are intact. Additionally, the study identifies that the safety benefits of CAVs are not proportional to CAV penetration, and full-scale benefits of CAVs can only be achieved at 100 % CAV penetration. Further, considering network efficiency as a performance metric and total crash rate involving conventional vehicles as a safety metric, a Pareto frontier is extracted, for varying CAV operational behaviour. The results presented in this study provide insights into the impacts of CAVs on traffic safety valuable for insurance companies and other industry participants, enabling safety-related services and more enterprising business models.}

Analyzing pooled data from multiple years carries the risk of introducing aggregation bias in the analysis. Those aggregated models might be structurally unstable, and the significance of the risk factors identified using those aggregated models might change over time due to the ongoing changes in vehicle technologies, law-enforcement technologies, and drivers’ attitudes. This study demonstrates the importance of testing the temporal stability of pooled data by utilizing logistic regression modeling to analyze all rear-end collisions that occurred in North Carolina for the period from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2015. Separate models were developed for each year to model injury severity of striking and struck drivers. The year-wise models were compared together to identify the most temporally stable factors, and it was found that older and female drivers are usually more severely injured, but they do not increase injury severity of the drivers they collide with. It was also found that compared to other light-duty vehicles, passenger cars are usually associated with increased injury severity to their drivers and reduced injury severity to the drivers of the vehicles they collide with. The increased age of a vehicle was found to increase the injury severity of its driver as well as the driver of the vehicle it collides with. Dark conditions were found to increase drivers’ injury severity, but adverse weather conditions have no similar effect. For comparison, aggregated models were also developed by pooling data from all analysis years (from 2004 to 2015) and were found to return significant factors that were found by the year-wise models to be temporally unstable. Chow tests were performed on the data, and it was found that pooling data for four years or more generally returned structurally unstable models.}

This study aims to employ the association rules mining (ARM) approach to discover the contributory crash-risk factors of HAZMAT vehicle-involved crashes on expressways. A case study is conducted using crash data obtained from the Korea Expressway Corporation crash database from 2008 to 2017. ARM was conducted using the Apriori algorithm, and a total of 855 interesting rules were generated. With appropriate support, confidence, and lift values, we found hidden patterns in the HAZMAT crash characteristics. The results indicate that HAZMAT vehicle-involved crashes are highly associated with male drivers, single vehicle-involved crashes, clear weather conditions, daytime, and mainline segments. Also, we found that HAZMAT tank-lorry and cargo truck crashes, single vehicle-involved crashes, and crashes on mainline segments of expressways had independent and unique association rules. The finding from this study demonstrates that ARM is a plausible data mining technique that can be employed to draw relationships between HAZMAT vehicle-involved crashes and significant crash-risk factors, and has the potential of providing more easy-to-understand results and relevant insights for the safety improvement of expressways.}

abstract = {Background
Cervical spine injury is a common result of traffic crashes, and such injuries range in severity from minor (i.e. sprain/strain) to moderate (intervertebral disk derangement) to serious and greater (fractures, dislocations, and spinal cord injuries). There are currently no reliable estimates of the number of crash-related spine injuries occurring in the US annually, although several publications have used national crash injury samples as a basis for estimating the frequency of both cervical and lumbar spinal disk injuries occurring in lower speed rear impact crashes.
Purpose
To develop a reliable estimate of the number of various types of cervical spine injuries occurring in the US by comparing data from national crash injury to national hospital ED and inpatient samples.
Study Design
Comparative cross-sectional
Methods
Cervical spine injury data were accessed, analyzed, and compared from 3 national databases; the National Automotive Sampling System-Crashworthiness Data System (NASS-CDS), Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS), and the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS).
Results
It is estimated that there are approximately 869,000 traffic crash-related cervical spine injuries seen in hospitals in the US annually, including around 841,000 sprain/strain (whiplash) injuries, 2800 spinal disk injuries, 23,500 fractures, 2800 spinal cord injuries, and 1500 dislocations. Because of a highly restrictive inclusion criteria for both crash and injury types, as well as a very small sample size, the NASS-CDS underestimated all types of crash-related cervical spine injuries seen in US hospital emergency departments by 84 %. The injury type with the largest degree of underestimation in the NASS-CDS was cervical disk injuries, which were estimated at an 88 % lower frequency than in the NEDS. National insurance claim data, which include cases of cervical disk injury diagnosed both in and outside of the ED, indicate that the NEDS likely undercounts cervical disk injuries by 92 %, and thus the NASS-CDS correspondingly undercounts such injuries by 99 % or more.
Conclusions
Because of a limited sample size and restrictive criteria for both crash and injury inclusion, the NASS-CDS cannot be used to estimate the number of crash-related spinal injuries of any type or severity in the US. The most inappropriate use of the database is for estimating the number of spinal injuries resulting from low speed rear impact collisions, as the NASS-CDS samples fewer than 1 in 100,000 of the cervical spine injuries of any type occurring in low speed rear impact collisions.}

In Experiment 1, 24 participants sat in a car parked on a closed road at each of three distances and rated the conspicuity of four bicyclists displaying taillights that varied in their placement, intensity, and mode. The results confirmed that bicycle taillights can significantly enhance conspicuity in daylight. Varying the placement of the taillights revealed that having an “always on” taillight mounted to each of the rider’s ankles was the most conspicuous location to mount taillights, and this effect was particularly strong at greater viewing distances. For seat post-mounted taillights, flashing taillights were rated as more conspicuous. In Experiment 2, 186 participants were passengers on a short drive during which they pressed a button each time they recognized that a bicyclist was present. Each participant passed a test bicyclist wearing one of four clothing configurations. When the cyclist wore a fluorescent yellow jersey paired with fluorescent yellow leg covers, participants responded from a distance that was 3.3 times greater than when the cyclist wore the same jersey without the yellow leg covers. Both of these experiments demonstrate that highlighting bicyclists’ pedaling motion enhances their conspicuity when viewed from behind. These results further emphasize the conspicuity benefits of biological motion and provide bicyclists with techniques to enhance their own conspicuity in daylight.}

For this interrupted time series analysis, we used a segmented regression method to assess the association between the implementation of child-restraint legislation and motor-vehicle related serious injuries and fatalities using data obtained from transport authorities in each jurisdiction. We estimated the change in annual rates after the implementation of legislation with the number of motor-vehicle accidents resulting in fatalities or serious injuries as the outcome, and the total number of injuries (minor, serious and fatal) as an offset in the model. We identified 10882 motor-vehicle related crashes resulting in fatalities (n = 188), serious injuries (n = 1730) and minor injuries (n = 8964). In NSW and VIC, the rate ratio was statistically significant and positive, indicating an increase in the rate of serious injuries and fatalities in the period post-legislation compared to the period prior to legislation. In all other states and territories, we did not find a statistically significant effect of legislation Road safety programs incorporating interventions targeted at increasing awareness of optimal restraint practices, strengthened enforcement and measures to improve the affordability of restraints are needed to support legislation.}

We study injury severity using two metrics for each occupant – the number of injuries suffered, and the probability of suffering a serious or worse (MAIS 3+) injury. We use a cross-sectional set of generally-representative MVC data between 2010 and 2015 as a basis for our research. Collision factors that influence the crash environment are combined with the injuries that were suffered in MVCs. The influence of delta-V is captured using a mediation analysis, whereby delta-V acts as the focal point between crash factors and injury outcome. The mediation approach adds to existing research by presenting a detailed view of the relationship between injury severity, delta-V and other collision factors. We find evidence of competitive mediation, wherein a collision factor’s positive association with injury severity is offset by a negative association with delta-V. Neglecting to include delta-V in our study would have let the factor’s association with injury severity go undiscovered. In addition, certain collision factors are found to be related to injury severity solely because of delta-V, while others are found to have a significant impact regardless of delta-V. Our results support the multitude of policy recommendations that promote seatbelt use and warn against alcohol-impaired driving, and support the proliferation of safety-enabled vehicles whose technology can mitigate the bodily damage associated with detrimental crash types.}

The aim of this study was to investigate truck drivers’ speed choice, gaze behaviour and interaction strategies in relation to vulnerable road users (VRU) when turning right in signalised and non-signalised intersections. Truck drivers experienced (n = 14) or inexperienced (n = 15) with urban traffic drove a 15 km long test route in an urban environment. To guarantee the presence of VRUs, a confederate cyclist with the task to cycle straight on was present in three intersections. Overall, the results suggest that the specific experience of driving a truck in the city has little effect on the strategies employed when interacting with cyclists in a right turn scenario. Neither gaze nor strategic placement or speed related variables differed significantly between the groups, though the drivers inexperienced with urban traffic tended to be more cautious. Glance and driving behaviour were more related to the preconditions afforded by the infrastructure and to interaction type, which is a combination of those infrastructural preconditions and the truck driver’s own choice of action. The likelihood of a favourable interaction should be increased, where the truck remains behind the VRUs on the approach to the intersection, something which eliminates the potential for a collision. Education of truck drivers, infrastructure design and improved traffic light sequences are potential ways to reduce the occurrence of more demanding and dangerous interaction types.}

A new method of safety analysis based on failure-caused traffic conflicts and the Lomax distribution was recently proposed to estimate crash frequency more efficiently than with crash data. This paper has two objectives: (1) demonstrate the method applicability to near-departure data collected in a driving simulator, and (2) provide initial evidence of the method validity. Traffic failures and road users’ delayed responses to these failures is considered as the primary cause of both conflicts and crashes. Unlike early postulated exceedance distributions the proposed Lomax distribution of response delays was derived from the causal mechanism. From this perspective, the proposed method may use the entire range of the underlying distribution as long as the observed conflicts are failure-related. The fundamentals of the method are briefly explained with the emphasis on certain behavior of crash frequency estimates implied by the proposed theory. Then, an example application of the method to analyze the risk of road departures in a driving simulator is presented. The results are then inspected and the trend in the estimates derived from the theory is confirmed. This finding points to the method validity. Additional applications of the method are expected to further increase the confidence towards the method and to encourage its introduction to the safety engineering practice.}

abstract = {Objective
The purpose of this study is to summarize the evidence for the association between exposure to a motor vehicle collision (MVC) and future low back pain (LBP).
Literature survey
Persistent low back pain (LBP) is a relatively common complaint after acute injury in a MVC, with a reported 1 year post-crash prevalence of at least 31 % of exposed individuals. Interpretation of this finding is challenging given the high incidence of LBP in the general population that is not exposed to a MVC. Risk studies with comparison control groups need to be examined in a systematic review.
Methodology
A systematic search of five electronic databases from 1998 to 2019 was performed. Eligible studies describing exposure to a MVC and risk of future non-specific LBP were critically appraised using the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) instrument. The results were summarized using best-evidence synthesis principles, a random effects meta-analysis and testing for publication bias.
Synthesis
The search strategy yielded 1136 articles, three of which were found to be at low to medium risk of bias after critical appraisal. All three studies reported a positive association between an acute injury in a MVC and future LBP. Pooled analysis of the results resulted in an unadjusted relative risk of future LBP in the MVC-exposed and injured population versus the non-exposed population of 2.7 (95 % CI [1.9, 3.8]), which equates to a 63 % attributable risk under the exposed.
Conclusions
There was a consistent positive association in the critically reviewed literature that investigated the risk of future LBP following an acute MVC-related injury. For the patient with chronic low back pain who was initially injured in a MVC, more often than not (63 % of the time) the condition was caused by the MVC. These findings are likely to be of interest to clinicians, insurers, patients, governments and the courts. Future studies from both general and clinical populations would help strengthen these results.}

Developing a real-time continuous lane change detection system can assist drivers to perform and deal with complex driving tasks or provide assistance when it is needed the most. This study proposed trajectory-level lane change detection models based on features from vehicle kinematics, machine vision, roadway characteristics, and driver demographics under different weather conditions. To develop the models, the SHRP2 Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) and Roadway Information Database (RID) datasets were utilized. Initially, descriptive statistics were utilized to investigate the lane change behavior, which revealed significant differences among different weather conditions for most of the parameters. Six data fusion categories were introduced for the first time, considering different data availability. In order to select relevant features in each category, Boruta, a wrapper-based algorithm was employed. The lane change detection models were trained, validated, and comparatively evaluated using four Machine Learning algorithms including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and eXtrem Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The results revealed that the highest overall detection accuracy was found to be 95.9 % using the XGBoost model when all the features were included in the model. Moreover, the highest overall detection accuracy of 81.9 % using the RF model was achieved considering only vehicle kinematics-based features, indicating that the proposed model could be utilized when other data are not available. Furthermore, the analysis of the impact of weather conditions on lane change detection suggested that incorporating weather could improve the accuracy of lane change detection. In addition, the analysis of early lane change detection indicated that the proposed algorithm could predict the lane changes within 5 s before the vehicles cross the lane line. The developed detection models could be used to monitor and control driver behavior in a Cooperative Automated Vehicle environment.}

This paper evaluates the causal effects of cellphone distraction on traffic crashes using propensity score weighting approaches and naturalistic driving study (NDS) data.
Methods
We adopt three propensity score weighting approaches to estimate the causal odds ratio (OR) of cellphone use on three different event-populations, including average treatment effect (ATE) on the whole population, average treatment effect on the treated population (ATT), and average treatment effect on the overlapping population (ATO). Three types of cellphone distractions are evaluated: overall cellphone use, talking, and visual-manual tasks. The propensity scores are estimated based on driver, roadway, and environmental characteristics. The Second Strategic Highway Research Program NDS data used in this study include 3400 participant drivers with 1047 severe crashes and 19,798 random case-cohort control driving segments.
Results
The study reveals several highly imbalanced potential confounding factors among cellphone use groups, e.g., income, age, and time of day, which could lead to biased risk estimation. All three propensity score approaches improve the balance of the baseline characteristics. The propensity score adjusted ORs differ from unweighted ORs substantially, ranging from −44.25% to 54.88%. Specifically, the adjusted ORs for young drivers are higher than unweighted ORs and these for middle-age drivers are lower. Among different cellphone related distractions, the ORs associated with visual-manual tasks (OR range: 3.47–6.63) are uniformly higher than overall cellphone distraction and cellphone talking (OR range: 0.63–4.15). Cellphone talking increases the risk for young drivers but has no significant impact on middle-age drivers.
Conclusion
Propensity score approaches effectively mitigate potential confounding effect caused by imbalanced driver environmental characteristics in the observational NDS data. The ATT and ATO estimands are recommended for NDS case-cohort studies. ATT reflects the effect among exposed events, i.e. crashes or controls with cellphone exposure and ATO reflects the effect among events with similar characteristics. The study confirms the significant causal effect of overall cellphone distraction on crash risk and the heterogeneity in safety impact by age group.}

abstract = {In order to overcome the shortcomings of crash data a number of surrogate measures of safety have been developed and proposed by various researchers. One of the most widely used temporal indicators is time-to-collision (TTC) which requires the road users to be on a collision course. Road users that are strictly speaking not on a collision course actually might behave and take evasive actions as if they were, thus indicating that such near-miss situations might also be relevant for safety analysis. Taking that into account, a more flexible indicator T2, which does not require the two vehicles to be on a collision course, describes the expected time for the second road user to arrive at the conflict point. Recently extreme value theory (EVT) offering two approaches, block maxima (BM) and Peak over Threshold (POT), has been applied in combination with surrogate indicators to estimate crash probabilities. Most of this research has focused on testing BM and POT as well as validating various surrogate safety indicators by comparing model estimates to actual crash frequencies. The comparison of collision course indicators with indicators including crossing course interactions and their performance using EVT has not been investigated yet. In this study we are seeking answers to under what conditions these indicators perform better and whether they are transferable. Using data gathered at a signalized intersection focusing on left-turning and straight moving vehicle interactions our analysis concluded that the two indicators are transferable with stricter threshold values for T2 and that POT gives more reasonable results.}

Thirty experienced drivers completed an on-road driving test and drove two different simulators, each simulator drive comprising seven difficulty-moderated driving scenarios. Between-simulator contrasts revealed largely absolute validity, the anticipated effects of increased difficulty within driving scenarios, but weak relationships between performance of different driving scenarios. On-road driving was reliably assessed by a nationally-recognised expert driving assessor, as reflected by standard statistical measures of reliability and consistency. However, on-road driving revealed relatively little cross-category correlation of on-road driving errors, or between on-road and simulator driving. Thus, despite the compelling evidence of absolute and relative validity within and between simulators, there is little evidence of criterion validity (i.e. relationship to on road driving, as assessed by the expert assessor). Moreover, the study provides strong evidence for orthogonality in the driving task- driving comprises large numbers of relatively separate tasks.}

Taking this observation as a starting point, this study examines the relationship between highway safety and socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, using an extensive crash dataset from Kentucky. Its focus is single- and two-unit crashes that involve commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) and automobiles. Using binary logistic regression and the quasi-induced exposure technique to analyze data on the socioeconomic and demographic attributes of the zip codes in which drivers reside, factors are identified which can serve as indicators of crash occurrence. Variables such as income, education level, poverty level, employment, age, gender, and rurality of the driver’s zip code influence the likelihood of a driver being at fault in a crash. Socioeconomic factors exert a similar influence on CMV and automobile crashes, irrespective of the number of vehicles involved. Research findings can be used to identify groups of drivers most likely to be involved in crashes and develop targeted and efficient safety programs.}

The aim of this study was to find some characteristics important for the speed mis-estimation tendencies and its values. Seventy participants estimated speed 3920 times in total. Research included three experiments. One vehicle participated in the first experiment, while second and third experiments involved two vehicles, with various combinations of vehicle positions and speeds. Initially it was determined that the pedestrians had tendencies to speed underestimation rather than its overestimation and accurate estimation. When the participants estimated the speed of one vehicle, they were more inclined to underestimation of higher speeds (over 50 km/h). On the other hand, in the situations where the participants estimated the speed of two vehicles, they showed a serious tendency towards underestimation of lower speeds (under 50 km/h) which was completely opposite. The factors such as driving experience, age and gender were identified as statistically important in terms of speed underestimation value. We determined that an increase in task complexity, with introduction of a larger number of vehicles, resulted in more severe speed underestimation. Finally, we identified some of the most risky traffic situations in terms of speed underestimation tendencies showed by our participants.}

This study aimed to examine the difference in take-over performance between high crash risk (HCR) and lower crash risk (LCR) drivers in emergency take-over situations during conditionally automated driving. In the current simulator study, a 3 × 3 (within-subjects) factorial design was used, including the task factors (no task, reading the news, and watching a video) and time budget factors (time budget = 3 s, 4 s, and 5 s). Forty-eight participants completed a test drive on an approximately 10 km long two-way six-lane urban road. The participants firstly were in manual control and then switched to the automated driving mode at a speed of 50 km/h. The automated driving system was able to detect a broken car in the ego-lane and requested the driver to take over the control of the vehicle. There are at least one or two other vehicles or motorcycles on each side of the ego-vehicle, resulting in fewer escape paths. For the two non-handheld non-driving-related tasks (NDRTs), the participants were asked to be fully engaged in a task without any need to monitor the road environments. Each participant completed nine emergency take-over situations. The participants were classified into two groups that were labeled LCR (N ≤ 2) and HCR drivers (N ≥ 3) according to the number of accidents per driver. The results show that LCR drivers had shorter brake reaction time compared to HCR drivers. For all drivers, the engagement in a task led to longer response times, and the time budget affected the longitudinal vehicle control. In addition, the task affected the response times for LCR and HCR drivers, but only the time budget affected the longitudinal vehicle control for LCR drivers. For all drivers, LCR and HCR drivers, the time budget and task affected the safety of take-over. Especially, the two non-handheld everyday tasks seem to have a similar effect on the drivers’ workload. Therefore, the HCR drivers had a lower hazard perception compared to the LCR drivers, and the factor regarding the individual difference of driving ability in take-over situations should be considered to design safe take-over concepts for automated vehicles.}

abstract = {Background
In May 2014, the Dominican Republic introduced the 911-emergency response system (ERS) in Santo Domingo. Before its introduction, more than 40 phone numbers were available to report emergencies. The objective of this work is to assess whether this new emergency response system was effective in reducing traffic fatalities.
Methods
Weekly numbers of traffic fatalities per population and per vehicle fleet from January 2013 to December 2015 were obtained from the Ministry of Health and the National Institute of Statistics. A hybrid time-series difference-in-difference analysis using multivariable negative binomial regression models were used to compare trends in rates of traffic fatalities in Santo Domingo to La Romana and Santiago, before and after the introduction of the 911-ERS.
Results
Estimates from negative binomial models suggest that the introduction of the 911-ERS in Santo Domingo relative to Santiago-La Romana was associated with a 17% reduction in the Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) of traffic fatalities per 1 000 000 population (IRR = 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.67; 1.03) and with a 20% reduction in the IRR of weekly traffic fatalities per 1 000 000 vehicle fleet (IRR = 0.80, 95% CI:0.67; 0.99).
Discussion
Our findings suggest that transitioning from multiple to one unique emergency phone number should be considered more attentively. Furthermore, the case of the Dominican Republic calls for more theoretical and methodological research to understand how to assess these road safety policies more accurately. Since various studies suggest that 911-ERS mature in the long run, how these systems evolve over time and other related variables should be carefully considered.}

This new form of mobility offers riders a flexible option for massive first-/last-mile trips. Despite the popularity, the limited regulations of E-Scooters raise numerous safety concerns among the public and agencies. Due to the unavailability of well-archived crash data, it is difficult to understand and characterize current state quo of E-Scooter-involved crashes. This paper aims to shorten the gap by analyzing a set of reported crash data to describe the patterns of crashes related to E-Scooter use. Specifically, massive media reports were searched and investigated for constructing the crash dataset. Key crash elements such as rider demographics, crash type, and location were organized in an information table for analysis. From 2017 to 2019, there were 169 E-Scooter-involved crashes identified from the news reports across the country. Through the descriptive analysis and cross tabulation analysis, the distinct characteristics of these reported crashes were highlighted. Overall, there was a growing trend for the reported E-Scooter-involved crashes unevenly distributed among the States. The distribution of the crashes across different groups of users, facilities, time periods, and severity levels also showed skewed patterns toward a subset of categories. The quantitative analyses also provide some supportive evidences for warranting the discussion on key issues, including helmet use, riding under influence (RUI), vulnerable riders, and data deficiency. This study highlights the importance of public awareness and timely developing safety countermeasures to mitigate crashes involving E-Scooters.}

This study evaluated the pedestrian’s (esp. the elderly) ability to estimate crossing time in a field experiment. The estimated crossing time was measured by an interval production method (participants produced an interval to represent their estimated crossing time) and an imagined crossing method. The results showed that while young pedestrians generally had an accurate estimation of their crossing time, old pedestrians consistently underestimated the crossing time in both methods, especially at a wider road. What’s worse, even fast walking cannot compensate for the large underestimation. Further analysis showed that although old pedestrians had the declined motor imagery ability and the worse general timing accuracy, none of them can account for the inaccuracy of estimation. These findings suggest that underestimation of crossing time may be one of the important reasons for the acknowledged risky road crossing decision-making in old pedestrians. It also calls for studies on assistive roadway designs and intervention programs targeting old pedestrians.}

Using a case study of Vietnam, this research aimed to understand the effect of problematic mobile phone use (also known as mobile phone addiction or compulsive mobile phone use), attitudes and beliefs, and perceived risk on the frequency of mobile phone use among motorcyclists and car drivers. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to motorcyclists (n1= 529) and car drivers (n2= 328) using an online survey and face-to-face survey. The survey took around 20-min to complete and participants were entered into a lottery for supermarket vouchers. Of the motorcyclists, 42% of the sample (the highest proportion) was in the 18-25 age group while the 36-45 age group accounted for the highest proportion among car drivers (34.8%). Using structural equation modelling (SEM), key findings showed that each construct influenced mobile phone use, but in different ways for motorcycle riders and car drivers. Attitudes and beliefs had the largest effect on mobile phone use while riding among motorcyclists, with problematic mobile phone use having the smallest influence. In contrast, problematic mobile phone use had the largest effect on mobile phone use while driving a car, with attitudes and beliefs having the smallest effect. The findings of this study point to the need for tailored interventions involving a range of actors (policymakers, police enforcement, mental health professionals, advocacy groups and the wider community) to raise awareness, modify attitudes and increase risk perception associated with mobile phone use while driving/riding. This can be achieved thorough educational tools and road safety campaigns which are focused on reducing this risky driving behaviour. This includes customising road safety programs for individuals and groups affected by problematic mobile phone use such as targeted advertising.}

Alcohol-involved riders tend to engage in other risk-taking behaviours such as un-helmeted riding which could further increases injury severity. The combined effect of alcohol-involved and un-helmeted riding on fatal injuries is rarely investigated. This study investigated the interaction effect between blood alcohol concentration and helmet use on fatal injuries.
Methods
This study used the National Taiwan Traffic Crash Dataset for the period from 2011 to 2015. Data on road crashes involving a motorcycle and an automobile were extracted and analysed. Multiple logistic regression models were used to calculate the adjusted odds ratio (AOR). We calculated an interaction effect for blood alcohol concentration and helmet use based on STROBE guidelines.
Results
There were a total of 669,292 motorcyclist casualties; among these casualties, 3459 (0.5 %) motorcyclists sustained fatal injuries. Alcohol-involved riders were 9.47 times (AOR = 9.47; 95 % CI = 8.75–10.25) more likely than sober ones to sustain fatal injuries. Alcohol-involved and un-helmeted riders were approximately 18 times (AOR = 18.1; CI: 15.9–20.4) more likely to sustain fatal injuries than sober and helmeted riders. Riders involved in head-on crashes and approach-turn motorcycle crashes had an increased probability of sustaining fatal injuries by 240 % (AOR = 3.4; 95 % CI = 2.91–4.09) and 132 % (AOR = 2.3; 95 % CI = 2.016–2.67), respectively.
Conclusions
This study found that alcohol-involved riding acts synergistically with un-helmeted riding to increase motorcyclist injury severity.}

abstract = {Both crash count and severity are thought to quantify crash risk at defined transport network locations (e.g. intersections, a particulate section of highway, etc.). Crash count is a measure of the likelihood of occurring a potential harmful event, whereas crash severity is a measure of the societal impact and harm to the society. As the majority of safety improvement programs are focused on preventing fatal and serious injury crashes, identification of high-risk sites—or blackspots—should ideally account for both severity and frequency of crashes. Past research efforts to incorporate crash severity into the identification of high-risk sites include multivariate crash count models, equivalent property damage only models and two-stage mixed models. These models, however, often require suitable distributional assumptions for computational efficiency, neglect the ordinal nature of crash severity, and are inadequate for capturing unobserved heterogeneity arising from possible correlations between crash counts of different severity levels. These limitations can ultimately lead to inefficient allocation of resources and misidentification of sites with high risk of fatal and serious injury crashes. Moreover, the implication of these models in blackspot identification is an important, unanswered question. While a joint econometric model of crash count and crash severity has the flexibility to account for the limitations mentioned previously, its ability to identify high-risk sites also needs to be examined. This study aims to fill this research gap by employing the joint model for blackspot identification. Using data from state-controlled roads in Queensland, Australia, a new risk score is developed based on predicted crash counts by severity, weighted by the cost ratio of severity levels. This weighted risk score is then used for identifying road segments with high risk of fatal and injury crashes. Results show that the joint model of crash count and crash severity has substantially improved prediction accuracy compared to the traditional count models. The correlation between crash counts of different severity levels captures the unobserved heterogeneity caused by the extra-variation in total crash counts and moderates the parameters in the joint model. In comparison with the traditional approaches, the proposed weighted risk score approach with the joint model of crash count and crash severity leads to the identification of a higher number of fatal and serious injury crashes in the top ranked sites flagged for safety improvements.}

abstract = {Numerous studies have developed intersection crash prediction models to identify crash hotspots and evaluate safety countermeasures. These studies largely considered only micro-level crash contributing factors such as traffic volume, traffic signals, etc. Some recent studies, however, have attempted to include macro-level crash contributing factors, such as population per zone, to predict the number of crashes at intersections. As many intersections are located between multiple zones and thus affected by factors from the multiple zones, the inclusion of macro-level factors requires boundary problems to be resolved. In this study, we introduce an advanced multilevel model, the multiple membership multilevel model (MMMM), for intersection crash analysis. Our objective was to reduce heterogeneity issues between zones in crash prediction model while avoiding misspecification of the model structure. We used five years of intersection crash data (2009–2013) for the City of Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada and identified micro- and macro-level factors that most affected intersection crashes. We compared the fitting performance of the MMMM with that of two existing models, a traditional single model (SM) and a conventional multilevel model (CMM). The MMMM outperformed the SM and CMM in terms of fitting capability. We found that the MMMM avoided both the underestimation of macro-level variance and the type I statistical error that tend to occur when the crash data are analyzed using a SM or CMM. Statistically significant micro-level and macro-level crash contributing factors in Regina included major roadway AADT, four legs, traffic signals, speed, young drivers, and different types of land use.}

abstract = {Cycling is increasingly promoted as a sustainable transport mode. However, bicyclists are more vulnerable to fatality and severe injury in road crashes, compared to vehicle occupants. It is necessary to identify the contributory factors to crashes and injuries involving bicyclists. For the prediction of motor vehicle crashes, comprehensive traffic count data, i.e. AADT and vehicle kilometer traveled (VKT), are commonly available to proxy the exposure. However, extensive bicycle count data are usually not available. In this study, revealed bicycle trip data of a public bicycle rental system in the Greater London is used to proxy the bicycle crash exposure. Random parameter negative binomial models are developed to measure the relationship between possible risk factors and bicycle crash frequency at the zonal level, based on the crash data in the Greater London in 2012−2013. Results indicate that model taking the bicycle use time as the exposure measure is superior to the other counterparts with the lowest AIC (Akaike information criterion) and BIC (Bayesian information criterion). Bicycle crash frequency is positively correlated to road density, commercial area, proportion of elderly, male and white race, and median household income. Additionally, separate bicycle crash prediction models are developed for different seasons. Effects of the presence of Cycle Superhighway and proportion of green area on bicycle crash frequency can vary across seasons. Findings of this study are indicative to the development of bicycle infrastructures, traffic management and control, and education and enforcement strategies that can enhance the safety awareness of bicyclists and reduce their crash risk in the long run.}

abstract = {Nowadays, intelligent transportation system (ITS) planning has been often integrated into transportation planning stage. As a component of ITS, traffic enforcement cameras have been found to reduce dangerous behaviors, such as red-light running and speeding. However, with limited resource, it is important to understand the effects of enforcement cameras on macro-level safety, so that traffic policy-makers can better allocate those resources to improve traffic safety from the planning stage. In this paper, we examined the effects of various traffic enforcement cameras on regional traffic crash risk, considering their interactions with roadway and land use characteristics. The Kunshan city in Suzhou, China was selected in this study and a spatial modeling analysis was applied. According to the modeling results, several conclusions can be drawn: 1. Interaction effects on regional injury/PDO crash risk were found between traffic enforcement cameras and roadway/land use factors; 2. Traffic enforcement cameras were found to be associated with decreased regional crash risk. Among them, red-light running and speeding cameras were associated with the reduction of injury/PDO crash frequency, which can be further enhanced when being installed in certain area (e.g. industrial, commercial, residential land use) and on certain roadways (e.g. major arterials, local roads). Illegal lane changing cameras were associated with the decrease in PDO crash frequency, while such effect on reducing injury crashes was only found as significant on major arterials; 3. The main effects of certain land use and roadway factors appeared to be mediated by traffic enforcement interaction terms. For example, the main effect of industrialized land use was found as insignificant, while the interaction term between industrial area and speeding cameras showed a significant effect of reducing injury/PDO crash frequency. Based on those findings, traffic enforcement cameras, as one of the major components of ITS, need to be carefully considered at the transportation planning stage. In general, this study provides valuable information for policy-makers and transportation planners to improve regional traffic safety, by properly allocating traffic enforcement resources.}

However, the geometry changes of the highway sections with H-curves often raise safety concerns. In order to deploy effective safety countermeasures, a critical task is to understand the risk factors associated with H-curves. Existing studies have made efforts to probe the safety issues associated with H-curves, whereas they were limited to relatively small-scale examinations because of the challenges in identifying H-curves from large road networks. In addition, due to the lack of well-archived traffic and roadway information, gathering other data associated with the H-curves is also difficult. Regarding to these gaps, this study aims to leverage open-source data to analyze the crash risk of highway sections with H-curves. In particular, the present study highlights itself from two main aspects: (i) a H-curve extraction tool was developed to facilitate large-scale curve data collection through the analytics of different open source data; and (ii) a crash modeling framework was developed to quantify H-curve crash risk. A case study based on a statewide road network was performed to test the developed crash risk models with the collected curve data. The results show the opportunities of using the developed tool for large-scale data collection and analyze the safety impacts of H-curve geometric properties, elevation change, traffic exposure, among others. Findings of this study provide insights into the improvement of H-curve data collection and safety evaluation.}

The benefits of the RSF approach are that it (1) is a special type of survival analysis able to accommodate the competing nature of multiple-event outcomes to the same event of interest (here the competing multiple events are crash severities), (2) is able to conduct an event-specific selection of risk factors, (3) has the capability to determine long-term cumulative effects of contributors with the cumulative incidence function (CIF), (4) provides high prediction performance, and (5) is effective in high-dimensional settings. The RSF approach is able to consider complexities in HRGC safety analysis, e.g., non-linear relationships between HRGCs crash severities and the contributing factors and heterogeneity in data. Variable importance (VIMP) technique is adopted in this research for selecting the most predictive contributors for each crash-severity level. Moreover, marginal effect analysis results real several HRGC countermeasures’ effectiveness. Several insightful findings are discovered. For examples, adding stop signs to HRGCs that already have a combination of gate, standard flashing lights, and audible devices will reduce the likelihood of property damage only (PDO) crashes for up to seven years; but after the seventh year, the crossings are more likely to have PDO crashes. Adding audible devices to crossing with gates and standard flashing lights will reduce crash likelihood, PDO, injury, and fatal crashes by 49 %, 52 %, 46 %, and 50 %, respectively.}

However, due to the lack of realistic background traffic, scenarios that can be tested in test tracks are usually static and limited. To address this limitation, a new safety assessment framework is proposed in this paper, which integrates an augmented reality (AR) testing platform and a testing scenario library generation (TSLG) method. The AR testing platform generates simulated background traffic in test tracks, which interact with subject ADS under test, to create a realistic traffic environment. The TSLG method can systematically generate a set of critical scenarios under each operational design domain (ODD) and the critical scenarios generated from the TSLG method can be imported into the AR testing platform. The proposed framework has been implemented in the Mcity test track at the University of Michigan with a Level 4 ADS. Field test results show that the proposed framework can accurately and efficiently evaluate the safety performance of highly ADS in a cost-effective fashion. In the cut-in case study, the proposed framework is estimated to accelerate the assessment process by 9.87×104 times comparing to the on-road test approach.}

While past simulation and field crash tests could present important findings for upgrading the geometric design of traffic barriers, there is still a gap regarding conducting an actual data analysis on side traffic barriers crashes with regards to their geometric dimensions. This paper aims at filling this gap by combining a statewide dataset of side traffic barrier geometric features with historical crashes on interstate roads in Wyoming. Therefore, geometric features including system height, post-spacing, lateral offset (from the edge of pavement), and side-slope of over 150 miles of side traffic barriers were inventoried by conducting a field survey on interstate roads in Wyoming. For the statistical analysis, a random-parameters ordered logit model was utilized to investigate variables impacting crash severity of side traffic barriers. It was found that system height could significantly impact the crash severity of side box beam barriers. Box beam barriers with a system height between 25 and 31 in. were identified to be less severe in comparison to other height categories, while showing minimum risks of severe crashes in the system height of 29−31 in.. On the other hand, box beam barriers with a height taller than 31 in. may increase crash severity.}

This has, in recent years, become a more severe problem than that caused by passenger vehicle-involved crashes. More studies need to be conducted in order to investigate factors that impact the severity of truck-involved crashes within specific scenarios. This study identifies and evaluates the factors that affect the severity of the truck-involved crashes at cross and T-intersections in North Carolina from 2005 to 2017. A latent class clustering for data segmentation is implemented to mitigate unobserved heterogeneity inherent in the crash data. Four partial proportional odds models, which include fixed and unfixed parameters, are developed considering the heterogeneous and ordinal nature inherent in severities. Estimated parameters and marginal effects are further investigated for better interpreting the impacts. Results show heterogeneous explanatory variables and associated coefficients for different classes and severity levels, which indicate the superiority of this combined approach to obtaining more specific factors and accurate coefficients that are estimated in different scenarios. Many factors are found to contribute to the severities, and crossroad scenarios are found to be more severe than T-intersections. The top five driving behaviors at intersections that contribute to the severity include disregarded signs, improper lane use, followed too closely, ignored signals, and failure to yield. These behaviors arouse a necessity to amend the traffic laws and strengthen drivers’ education while giving further insights to engineering practitioners and researchers.}

Fixed infrastructure-based vehicle detection devices were widely used in the previous studies to obtain different types of data for crash potential prediction. However, it was difficult to obtain data in large range through these devices due to the costs of installation and maintenance. This paper introduced a novel connected vehicle (CV) emulated data for real-time crash potential prediction. Different from the fixed devices’ data, CV emulated data have high flexibility and can be obtained continuously with relatively low cost. Crash and CV emulated data were collected from two urban arterials in Orlando, USA. Crash data were archived by the Signal for Analytics system (S4A), while the CV emulated data were obtained through the data collection API with a high frequency. Different data cleaning and preparation techniques were implemented, while various speed-related variables were generated from the CV emulated data. A Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) neural network was trained to predict the crash potential in the next 5−10 min. The results from the model illustrated the feasibility of using a novel CV emulated data to predict real-time crash potential. The average and 50th percentile speed were the two most important variables for the crash potential prediction. In addition, the proposed LSTM outperformed Bayesian logistics regression and XGBoost in terms of sensitivity, Area under Curve (AUC), and false alarm rate. With the rapid development of the connected vehicle systems, the results from this paper can be extended to other types of vehicles and data, which can significantly enhance traffic safety.}

The average annual incidences of crashes, mortality, and injuries have decreased after the promulgation of drunk driving law in 2011. In the post-intervention period, the increased slope for crashes, mortality and injury rates were, respectively, -0.140 to -0.006, -0.052 to -0.005 and -0.150 to -0.008, indicating a weaker downward trend of dependent variables. The more stringent drunk driving law is not as effective as expected. Drunk driving is still a severe traffic safety problem to be addressed in China. Both legislation and other prevention programs should be adopted to reduce road traffic injuries caused by drunk driving in China.}

To solve the scarcity of incident samples, a novel incident detection framework is proposed based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). First, spatial and temporal rules are presented to extract variables from traffic data, which is followed by the random forest algorithm to rank the importance of variables. Then, some new incident samples are generated using GANs. Finally, the support vector machine algorithm is applied as the incident detection model. Real traffic data, which were collected from a 69.5-mile section of the I-80 highway, are used to validate the proposed approach. A total of 140 detectors are installed on the section enabling traffic flow to be measured every 30s. During 14 days, 139 incident samples and 946 nonincident samples were extracted from the raw data. Five categories of experiments are designed to evaluate whether the proposed framework can solve the small sample size problem, imbalanced sample problem, and timeliness problem in the current incident detection system. The experimental results show that our proposed framework can considerably improve the detection rate and reduce the false alarm rate of traffic incident detection. The balance of the dataset can improve the detection rate from 87.48% to 90.68% and reduce the false alarm rate from 12.76% to 7.11%. This paper lends support to further studies on combining GANs with the machine learning model to address the imbalance and small sample size problems related to intelligent transportation systems.}

Although numerous studies have been conducted to understand the parameters contributing to bicyclist’s injury severity, most of these studies have focused on the relationship between crash severity and road, environmental, vehicle and human demographic parameters. No study has been found that investigated the relationship of bicyclist’s injury severity with speed and mass of both vehicles, as well as other crash dynamics aspects. This study developed a modelling framework to investigate the effect of variables such as speed, mass and crash angle on bicyclist’s injury severity in bicycle-car crashes at intersections. A combination of Newtonian Mechanics and statistical analysis was utilised to develop this theory. This modelling process followed a two-step approach. In the first step, Newtonian Mechanics was used to develop numerical models to estimate the impact force applied to the bicyclist. Variables affecting the associated impact forces were then identified. In the second step, a mixed binary logistic regression model was developed to estimate injury severity of a bicycle-vehicle crash as a function of mass of both vehicles, speed of both vehicles before and after the crash, restraint use and age of bicyclist. Transport Accident Commission (TAC) validated crash data was used to develop the model. The results of the numerical models showed that kinetic energy of the car before crash and kinetic energy of the bicycle after crash are important parameters affecting the injury severity of the cyclist in bicycle-vehicle crashes. The results of the mixed binary logistic regression model confirmed that the addition of kinetic energy of the car before crash and the kinetic energy of the bicycle post-crash had a statistically significant effect on injury severity of bicyclist. The results further showed that older bicyclists were involved in higher severity crashes and helmet-wearing reduced the injury severity of the bicyclist.}

abstract = {Earlier research on injury severity of truck-involved crashes focused primarily on single-truck and multi-vehicle crashes with truck involvement, or investigated truck-involved injury severity based on rural and urban locations, time of day variations, lighting conditions, roadway classification, and weather conditions. However, the impact of different vehicle-truck collisions on corresponding occupant injury severity is lacking. Therefore, this paper advances the current research by undertaking an extensive assessment of the occupant injury severity in truck-involved crashes based on vehicle types (i.e., single-truck, truck-car, truck-SUV/pickup, and truck-truck), and identifies the major occupant-, crash-, and geometric-related contributing factors. A series of log-likelihood ratio tests were conducted to justify that separate model by vehicle and occupant types are warranted. Injury severity models were developed using 10 years of crash data (2007–2016) on I-80 in Wyoming through binary logistic modeling with a Bayesian inference approach. The modeling results indicated that there were significant differences between the influences of a variety of variables on the injury severities when the truck-involved crashes are broken down by vehicle types and separated by occupant types. The age and gender of occupants, truck driver occupation, driver residency, sideswipes, presence of junctions, downgrades, curves, and weather conditions were found to have significantly different impacts on the occupant injury severity in different vehicle-truck crashes. Finally, with the incorporation of the random intercept in the modeling procedure, the presence of intra-crash and intra-vehicle correlations (effects of the common crash- and vehicle-specific unobserved factors) in injury severities were identified among persons within the same crash and same vehicle.}

abstract = {Introduction
Understanding who heeds the driving-related COVID-19 restrictions is critical for assisting public health professionals improve response to this and future pandemic events. The purpose of the current study was to characterize driving behavior changes among adolescents as a function of COVID-19 restrictions. It was hypothesized that adolescent driving would be reduced by COVID-19 restrictions, especially for younger teens, non-minorities, females, non-working teens, and those with higher prosocial tendencies.
Methods
Participants were licensed drivers in “REACT,” a longitudinal study of adolescent driving attention. Upon enrollment in REACT, drivers were required to be age 16 or 18, have been issued a driver’s license within the last two weeks, and be fluent in written/spoken English. The current observational cohort study was of drivers reporting driving exposure between February 8 and April 22, 2020. Linear mixed-effects models estimated differences in driving changes between COVID-19 periods.
Results
Results indicated a decrease across pre-COVID-19 period (February 8 – March 13, 2020) in days driven per week and vehicle miles driven (VMD) was explained by the change of slope post-COVID-19 restrictions (March 14 – April 22, 2020). Post-COVID-19, driving days per week decreased by 37 % and VMD decreased by 35 %. This decrease was lower in ethnic minorities, older adolescents, and employed adolescents. Those with greater dire prosocial tendencies showed greater post-COVID-19 driving decline.
Discussion
Findings provide early evidence of COVID-19 restriction-related adolescent driving changes suggesting older, employed, minority teens and teens with lower prosocial tendencies are less likely to reduce driving behavior. These observations provide a foundation for more extensive studies of adolescent drivers during various driving and contact restrictions and inform future public health campaigns for social distancing.}

To celebrate its 50th anniversary of publishing outstanding and insightful studies, a multi-dimensional statistical and visualized analysis of the AA\&P publications between 1969 and 2018 was performed using the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection database, bibliometrics and mapping-knowledge-domain (MKD) analytical methods, and scientometric tools. It was shown that the annual number of AA\&P’s publications has grown exponentially and that over the course of its development, AA\&P has been a leader in the field of road safety, both in terms of innovation and dissemination. By determining its key source countries and organizations, core authors, highly co-cited published documents, and high burst-strength publications, we showed that AA\&P’s areas of focus include the “effects of hazard and risk perception on driving behavior”, “crash frequency modeling analysis”, “intentional driving violations and aberrant driving behavior”, “epidemiology, assessment and prevention of road traffic injuries”, and “crash-injury severity modeling analysis”. Furthermore, the key burst papers that have played an important role in advancing research and guiding AA\&P in new directions – particularly those in the fields of crash frequency and crash-injury severity modeling analyses were identified. Finally, a modified Haddon matrix in the era of intelligent, connected and autonomous transportation systems is proposed to provide new insights into the emerging generation of road safety studies.}

abstract = {Emergency response drivers (ERDs) are often required to engage in high-risk driving manoeuvres on their way to a reported incident. Such risk requires that these drivers receive a high-level of training and continued development. The aim of this paper was to investigate an innovative format for a new potential tool that could support the training and assessment of these drivers: a single-clip Holistic Hazard Test, containing multiple hazards in a single route. In study one, we created a proof-of-concept 15-minute clip containing hazards, multiple-choice questions and probes to collect self-reported safety ratings. ERDs were more accurate on the multiple-choice questions (MCQs) than a control group, though response time scores to hazards did not reach the threshold for significance. In study two, we refined the development process and created a series of new holistic hazard tests across four counties of the East Midlands, UK. Each test contained many hazards and MCQs that assessed situation awareness and decision-making, based on the results of study 1. Participants were recruited across the four counties and were presented with both the test that was specific to their county and one of the unfamiliar-location tests, in order to assess the generalisability of the tests across different locales. The results showed no differences regarding location familiarity, suggesting that tests filmed in one area of the country can be viewed by drivers elsewhere without detriment to performance. ERDs once again responded to MCQs more accurately, and also scored more hazard points on the basis of faster responses to hazards compared to control participants. These results suggest such tests can successfully tap into ERD-specific skills with regard to spotting, predicting and responding to hazards on the road. We recommend refinement of this tool for assessment of emergency response drivers, and further development to extend the materials to create a training tool.}

In order to account for unobserved heterogeneity, a random parameter ordered probit with heterogeneity in the means approach is applied. The police-reported ROR crash data that occurred from 2014 to 2017 in the state of North Carolina is used. Four injury-severity levels are defined: property damage only (PDO), possible injury (PI), non-incapacitating (N), and F/I (by merging fatal and incapacitating). The driver, crash, roadway, environmental characteristics that potentially affect the driver injury severity are explored. Besides, the temporal stability of modeling results among the four-time periods is investigated using a series of likelihood ratio tests. Significant temporal instability is found, indicating underestimating the temporal instability might result in unreliable conclusions. Estimation results demonstrate that the indicators, including male driver, alcohol, and curved roadways, increase the possibility of fatal and incapacitating injuries in the ROR crash in most of the year periods.}

These measures included closures of educational institutions, non-essential businesses, events and activities, as well as working from and staying at home requirements. These measures have led to an economic downturn of unprecedented proportions. Generally, as economic activity declines, travel decreases and drivers are exposed to a lower risk of collisions. However, research on previous economic downturns suggests economic downturns differentially affect driver behaviours and situations. COVID-19 pandemic effects on road safety are currently unknown. However, preliminary information on factors such as the increased stress and anxiety brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, more “free” (idle) time, increased consumption of alcohol and drugs, and greater opportunities for speeding and stunt driving, might well have the opposite effect on road safety. Using an interactionist model we identify research questions for researchers to consider on potential person and situation factors associated with COVID-19 that could affect road safety during and after the pandemic. Collaborative efforts by researchers, and public and private sectors will be needed to gather data and develop road safety strategies in relation to the new reality of COVID-19.}

Speed has previously been highlighted as a key factor in the outcome of a crash but the literature to date has yet to provide a robust relationship between impact speed and the risk of serious injury for crashes other than pedestrian crashes. This study aimed to determine the relationship between impact speed and the risk of serious injury in light vehicle crashes. Crash data from the US based National Automotive Sampling System – Crashworthiness Data System collected from 2011 to 2015 were used in the analysis when there was a known impact speed from an event data recorder (EDR) and a known injury outcome. The analysis was conducted at the vehicle level. Data from a total of 1274 vehicles were used in logistic regressions, with the presence or absence of a serious injury as the binary dependent variable, and impact speed as the continuous independent variable. Individual risk curves were produced for front, side, rear and head on impacts. Impact speed was found to have a highly significant positive relationship to risk of serious injury for all impact types examined. The risk of serious injury reaches 1% at 28 km/h for head on impacts, 51 km/h for side impacts, 64 km/h for front impacts, and 67 km/h for rear impacts. The results emphasise the importance of measures that reduce impact speeds, be they road designs, vehicle technologies or enforced speed limit reductions, and highlight the need to prevent head on impacts.}

New driver states will emerge with increasing automation level with drivers potentially being allowed to sleep while driving a highly automated vehicle. Still at some point during a drive, drivers will be required to or voluntarily take back control of the vehicle. A simulator study was conducted to investigate drivers’ ability to take over the vehicle control after sleeping. In a within-subjects study design N = 25 test drivers completed a drive using a highly automated driving system a) during day time after a full night of sleep and b) early in the morning after a night of partial sleep deprivation. During the second drive, sleep was measured in drivers according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) standard using electroencephalography (EEG). In total, the participants had to handle four takeover requests (TORs) from the system, two while being awake (day drive) and two when being awakened from sleep stage N2 (morning drive). The objective criticality of the situations was assessed performing the Takeover Controllability rating (TOC-rating). The results indicate that the applied takeover time of 60 s was sufficient for drivers to reengage in driving after sleeping. Reaction times were extended by about 3 s after sleep compared to the wake condition. Takeover performance assessed with the TOC-rating however was clearly worse after sleep than after wakefulness which was also reflected in the drivers’ subjective perception of the criticality of the situation. Further research is needed on how to deal with performance impairments after waking up from sleep during automated driving.}

Because elderly drivers may experience decline in the physical and mental faculties required for driving (which could lead to unsafe driving behaviors), it is critical to determine whether elderly drivers are more likely than younger drivers to be at fault in a crash. This study uses Kentucky crash data and linked hospital and emergency department records to evaluate whether linked data can more accurately estimate the crash propensity of elderly drivers to be at-fault in injury crashes. The Kentucky crash data is edited to conform to the General Use Model (GUM), with crash propensities for linked data compared to propensities developed using the GUM dataset alone. The quasi-induced exposure method is used to determine crash exposure. Factors such as age, gender, and crash location are explored to assess their influence on the risk of a driver being at fault in an injury crash. The overall findings are consistent with previous research — elderly drivers are more likely than younger drivers to be at fault in a crash. Linking crash with hospital and emergency department records could also establish a clearer understanding of the injury crash propensity of all age groups. Equipped with this knowledge, transportation practitioners can design more targeted and effective countermeasures and safety programs to improve the safety of all motorists.}

Attitudes and emotional associations can affect how people attend to objects in their visual environment and physical approach/avoidance responses, but few studies have extended these approaches into the road safety domain. Existing driving simulator studies of driver-bicyclist interactions have focused on driver behavior but not underlying attitudes and their effect on safety-related behaviors. This research explored the impact of implicit and explicit attitudes on drivers' behavior in interactions with bicyclists. In a driving simulator, various objective measures of safety (e.g., speed, passing distance, crash occurrence) were collected in an overtaking scenario. Participants' self-reported attitudes about driving and bicyclists were collected via survey instrument, along with an online test of subconscious attitudes called an Implicit Association Test, developed to examine preference between drivers and bicyclists. Importantly, this study examined not only distance, but duration and speed during overtaking. Results demonstrate that conscious attitudes affect how quickly and closely drivers overtake bicyclists. Participants who hold negative attitudes about bicyclists as a legitimate road user group passed significantly faster, while people with concerns about their knowledge or judgment about overtaking a bicyclist passed further and more slowly. Drivers self-identification as a bicyclist predicted higher passing speeds, while respondents who bicycle weekly drove closer but more slowly to the simulated bicyclist. These behaviors did not significantly differ based on the measure of implicit attitudes. The results of this study provide potential avenues for infrastructure and education interventions to improve pedestrian and bicyclist safety. Additionally, pairing driving simulator behavior with attitudinal measures represents a significant methodological contribution.}

Results from a survey showed that approximately 16% of the motorcycle taxi drivers reported fatigue-related crash involvement. It was also found that nearly 37% of all crashes reported by motorcycle taxi drivers were related to fatigue while riding a motorcycle taxi. Results of the heterogeneity-in-means random parameter logistic model suggested that working fulltime, more delivery trips, and overweight conditions were associated with increased likelihoods of fatigue-related crash involvement. Hybrid taxi drivers, who operate as either traditional or ride-hailing taxi drivers at different times, and most ride-hailing taxi drivers had a reduced likelihood of fatigue-related crash involvement when compared to traditional taxi drivers. Overall, this study has revealed a significant issue of fatigue-related crashes among motorcycle taxi drivers. Immediate interventions via publicity or educational campaigns should be considered by authorities to address this important issue. Ride-hailing companies should contribute by sending warnings of excessive riding hours to ride-hailing taxi drivers.}

Events of harsh driver behavior (8592 harsh accelerations and 3946 harsh brakings) were mapped to delimited segments and junctions of two urban expressways in Athens, Greece. For the analysis, two multiple linear regression models and two log-linear regression models were developed. Results indicate that in road segments there is an increase in the number of harsh events if average traffic flow per lane increases in the respective areas. Furthermore, as the average occupancy increases in junctions, there is an increase in harsh accelerations, and as the average speed increases, more harsh deceleration events occur. It is evident that traffic characteristics (traffic flow \& speed) have the most statistically significant impact on the frequency of harsh events compared to factors related to road geometry and driver behavior.}

abstract = {The Active Traffic Management (ATM) system has been widely used in the United States and the European countries to improve the traffic safety of urban expressways. The accurate real-time crash risk prediction is fundamental to the system running well. Crash data are characterized by small probability, which poses a typical Imbalanced Data Classification problem. Most previous studies mainly improved the prediction methods only in data level or algorithm level, which may be inadequate to predict the crash risk accurately especially in a continuous real-time traffic data environment. The comprehensive imbalanced classification algorithm was examined in this research to build more accurate real-time traffic crash risk prediction model. At the output level, the Youden index method has been proved to be of the best ability to divide the prediction results and Probability Calibration Method was proposed to optimize the prediction results in further. At the data level, Under-sampling and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique(SMOTE) methods were compared to solve the imbalanced data classification problem by changing the data distribution. At the algorithm level, the cost-sensitive MLP algorithm and Adaboost algorithm were examined and finally the random sampling cost-sensitive MLP model(RCSMLP) and Rusboost model were constructed by synthesizing the optimization methods from three levels. The sensitivity of the RCSMLP model reached 78.10 % and the specificity of the model reached 81.44 %. The AUC and sensitivity of the Rusboost model reached 0.892 and 0.842 while the specificity of the model reached 0.816, which shows the better performance in dealing with the imbalanced traffic crash risk prediction problem compared to existed prediction models. The proposed method of improving prediction accuracy in this study is universal and can be applied to many other prediction models to predict real-time traffic crash risk.}

abstract = {More than 1500 U.S. law enforcement personnel fatalities occurred from 2007 to 2016, with 39 % of these related to automobile crashes. This study looked at various types of lighting on police vehicles to determine if changes made to the visibility of a police vehicle can impact the surrounding traffic behavior and increase safety for both law enforcement and the general public. Unmarked and marked police vehicles were positioned behind a civilian vehicle on the shoulder of five different multi-lane highways in Virginia, simulating a routine traffic stop. The data collected indicated that more lighting and the use of red in a light bar impact traffic behavior in terms of merging and speed when passing a police vehicle. The benefits may be attributed to the symbolic influence of red as denoting a different type of emergency than a traffic stop in addition to red’s chromatic contrast against the blue sky during the daytime.}

Owing to the lack of exposure data, the detection of WWR and its relationship with the built environment (BE) factors remain unclear. Accordingly, this study fills the research gaps by proposing a WWR detection framework based on bike-sharing trajectories collected from Chengdu, China. Moreover, this study adopts Negative Binomial-based Additive Decision Tree to investigate the impacts of built environment on WWR frequencies. Results reveal that (1) WWR distribution is unaffected by different periods in a day; (2) road length is more influential than road level and road direction in WWR occurrence; (3) company, bus stop, subway station, residence, and catering facility are primary contributors affecting WWR behavior during peak hours, whereas education becomes an emerging influential variable during nonpeak hours; and most importantly, (4) these variables clearly present non-linear effects on the WWR frequencies. Therefore, geographically differentiated policies should be adopted for bicycle safety improvement.}

abstract = {Traditional methods for identifying crash-prone roadways are mainly based on historical crash data. It usually requires more than three years to collect a sufficient amount of dataset for road safety assessment. However, the emerging connected vehicles (CVs) technology generates rich instantaneous information, which can be used to identify dangerous road sections proactively. Information about the identified crash-prone intersections can be shared with the surrounding vehicles via CVs communication technology to promote cautious driving behaviors; in the longer term, such information will guide the implementation of countermeasures to prevent potential crashes. This study proposed a deep-learning based method to predict the risk level at intersections based on CVs data from the Michigan Safety Pilot program and historical traffic and intersection crash data in areas around Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA. One month of data by CVs at intersections were used for analyses, which accounts for about 3%–12% of overall trips. The risk levels of 774 intersections (i.e., low, medium and high risk) are determined by the annual crash rates. Feature extraction process is applied to both CV’s data and traffic data at each intersection and 24 features are extracted. Two black-box deep-learning models, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) are trained with the extracted features. A number of hyperparameters that affect prediction performance are fine-tuned using Bayesian optimization algorithm for each model. The performance of the two deep learning models, which are black-box models, were also compared with a decision tree model, a white-box type of simple machine learning model. The results showed that the accuracies of deep learning (DL) models were slightly better (both over 90 %) than the decision tree model (about 87 %). This indicated that the DL models were capable of uncover the inherent complexity from the dataset and therefore provided higher accuracy than the traditional machine learning model. CNN model achieves slightly higher accuracy (93.8 %) and is recommended as the classifier to predict the risk level at intersections in practice. The interpretability analysis of the CNN model is conducted to confirm the validity of the model. This study shows that combination of CVs data (V2V and V2I) and deep learning networks (i.e. MLP and CNN used in this paper) is promising to determine crash risks at intersections with high time efficiency and at low CV penetration rates, which help to deploy countermeasures to reduce the crash rates and resolve traffic safety problems.}

These driving aids include speed advisory, car-following assistance, lane-changing support, and advanced information about possible unseen hazards, among many others. While various studies have attempted to examine the effectiveness of different driving aids discretely, it is still vague how drivers perform when they are exposed to a connected environment with vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication capabilities. As such, the objective of this study is to examine the effects of the connected environment on driving behavior and safety. To achieve this aim, an innovative driving simulator experiment was designed to mimic a connected environment using the CARRS-Q Advanced Driving Simulator. Two types of driving aids were disseminated in the connected environment: continuous and event-based information. Seventy-eight participants with diverse backgrounds drove the simulator in four driving conditions: baseline (without driving aids), perfect communication (uninterrupted supply of driving aids), communication delay (driving aids are delayed), and communication loss (intermittent loss of driving aids). Various key driving behavior indicators were analyzed and compared across various routine driving tasks such as car-following, lane-changing, interactions with traffic lights, and giving way to pedestrians at pedestrian crossings. Results suggest that drivers in the perfect communication scenario maintain a longer time-to-collision during car-following, a longer time-to-collision to pedestrian, a lower deceleration to avoid a crash during lane-changing, and a lower propensity of yellow light running. Overall, drivers in the connected environment are found to make informed (thus better) decisions towards safe driving.}

abstract = {The identification of accident hot spots is a central task of road safety management. Bayesian count data models have emerged as the workhorse method for producing probabilistic rankings of hazardous sites in road networks. Typically, these methods assume simple linear link function specifications, which, however, limit the predictive power of a model. Furthermore, extensive specification searches are precluded by complex model structures arising from the need to account for unobserved heterogeneity and spatial correlations. Modern machine learning (ML) methods offer ways to automate the specification of the link function. However, these methods do not capture estimation uncertainty, and it is also difficult to incorporate spatial correlations. In light of these gaps in the literature, this paper proposes a new spatial negative binomial model which uses Bayesian additive regression trees to endogenously select the specification of the link function. Posterior inference in the proposed model is made feasible with the help of the Pólya-Gamma data augmentation technique. We test the performance of this new model on a crash count data set from a metropolitan highway network. The empirical results show that the proposed model performs at least as well as a baseline spatial count data model with random parameters in terms of goodness of fit and site ranking ability.}

abstract = {Road crashes impose an important burden on health and the economy. Numerous efforts have been undertaken to understand the factors that affect road collisions in general, and the severity of crashes in particular. In this literature several strategies have been proposed to model interactions between parties in a crash, including the use of variables regarding the other party (or parties) in the collision, data subsetting, and estimating models with hierarchical components. Since no systematic assessment has been conducted of the performance of these strategies, they appear to be used in an ad-hoc fashion in the literature. The objective of this paper is to empirically evaluate ways to model party interactions in the context of crashes involving two parties. To this end, a series of models are estimated using data from Canada's National Collision Database. Three levels of crash severity (no injury/injury/fatality) are analyzed using ordered probit models and covariates for the parties in the crash and the conditions of the crash. The models are assessed using predicted shares and classes of outcomes, and the results highlight the importance of considering opponent effects in crash severity analysis. The study also suggests that hierarchical (i.e., multi-level) specifications and subsetting do not necessarily perform better than a relatively simple single-level model with opponent-related factors. The results of this study provide insights regarding the performance of different modelling strategies, and should be informative to researchers in the field of crash severity.}

This is a reactive and macroscopic approach that gives little insight into how important dynamic signal cycle-related variables can affect intersection safety such as the arrival type and the shock wave characteristics. The objective of this study is to develop traffic conflict-based real-time safety models for signalized intersections using several state-of-the-art techniques. Traffic conflicts were measured by multiple indicators including time-to-collision (TTC), modified time-to-collision (MTTC), and deceleration rate to avoid collision (DRAC). Traffic conflict rate was employed as independent variable while traffic volume, queue length, shock wave area, shock wave speed, and platoon ratio of each cycle were used as covariates in the safety models. Four candidate Tobit models were developed and compared under the Bayesian framework: conventional Tobit model, grouped random parameters Tobit (GRP-Tobit) model, random intercept Tobit (RI-Tobit) model, and random parameters Tobit (RP-Tobit) model. The results showed that the GRP-Tobit model performs best with lowest Deviance Information Criteria (DIC), indicating that accounting for the unobserved heterogeneity across sites can significantly improve the model fit. The model estimation results showed that higher conflict rates were associated with various shock wave characteristics (positive sign for shock wave area, shock wave speed, and queue length) and higher traffic volume. Lower conflict rates were related with higher platoon ratio (favorable arrival patterns). The developed models can have potential applications in real-time safety evaluation, real-time optimization of signal control, and connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) trajectories planning.}

We adopt a full Bayesian hierarchical framework with Multivariate Conditional Autoregressive Priors to account for the complex spatial correlation structure as well as the unobserved heterogeneity. Using aggregated crash count data (Property Damage Only and Bodily Injuries) for the 414 census tracts, the analysis outcomes reveal that census tracts providing more jobs and having a higher proportion of commercial land use would have higher likelihood of relative crash risks in both severity levels. Inclusion of correlation structure between frequency as well as within crash-severity-level has proven a significant increase on the performance of the model, verifying influences of space on the frequency and severity of distraction-affected vehicle crashes. In addition, this research presents areas of higher relative risks (spatial clusters) that have 1.5 times elevated risk of collision than other census tracts. The identification of areas of excessive risks informs us to devise policies to mitigate negative consequences of distraction-affected crashes.}

Route familiarity has been found greatly associated with driver behaviour and traffic safety. This study aimed to investigate and compare the contributory factors that significantly influence the injury severities of the familiar drivers and unfamiliar drivers involved in mountainous highway single-vehicle crashes. Based on 3037 cases of mountainous highway single-vehicle crashes from 2015 to 2017, the characteristics related to crash, environment, vehicle and driver are included. Random-effects generalized ordered probit (REGOP) models were applied to model injury severities of familiar drivers and unfamiliar drivers that are involved in the single-vehicle crashes on the mountainous highways, given that the single-vehicle crashes had occurred. The results of REGOP models showed that 8 of the studied factors are found to be significantly associated with the injury severities of the familiar drivers, and 10 of the studied factors are found to significantly influence the injury severities of unfamiliar drivers. These research results suggest that there is a large difference of significant factors contributing to the injury severities between familiar drivers and unfamiliar drivers. The results shed light on both the similar and different causes of high injury severities for familiar and unfamiliar drivers involved in mountainous highway single-vehicle crashes. These research results can help develop effective countermeasures and proper policies for familiar drivers and unfamiliar drivers targetedly on the mountainous highways and alleviate injury severities of mountainous highway single-vehicle crashes to some extent. Based on the results of this study, some potential countermeasures can be proposed to minimize the risk of single-vehicle crashes on different mountainous highways, including tourism highways with a large number of unfamiliar drivers and other normal mountainous highways with more familiar drivers.}

A nice feature of the CVs in this project is that they are equipped with in-vehicle forward collision warning systems that are capable of providing both the speed of a preceding vehicle and the spacing between the preceding vehicle and a subject vehicle. This technical support enables us to systematically analyze vehicle interactions in terms of traffic safety. The crash potential index (CPI), which is able to analyze vehicle interactions in terms of crash risks, was adopted to quantify the crash potential of CVs when the forward hazardous situation warning (FHSW) information was either provided or not provided. The results of this study show that the average speed decreased by 10.2 % and the time-to-collision (TTC) increased by 5.3 % when warning information was provided. In addition, the achievable reduction in the CPI was approximately 20.7 % due to the provision of warning information. An illustrative demonstration of identifying freeway hazardous spots was also presented as a further application of the CPI analysis. The outcomes of this study will be useful for the establishment of relevant policies to promote CV technologies.}

abstract = {Objective
In Vietnam, motorcycle riders comprise about three-quarters of road traffic fatalities, the most common cause of which is head injuries that can be prevented by wearing a helmet. This study aims to assess helmet-wearing behaviors in Ho Chi Minh City, the largest city in Vietnam.
Methods
Eight rounds of observational studies were conducted in six randomly selected locations between July 2015 and April 2019. Given the multinomial nature of the outcome measure (not wearing a helmet; wearing a substandard helmet; wearing an unstrapped standard helmet; wearing a strapped standard helmet), a multinomial model was developed to estimate the level and trend of helmet use and identify the related individual and environmental factors.
Findings
A total of 479,892 motorcycle riders were observed, over 90 % of whom were wearing helmets (range over the eight rounds: 92.5 %–96.0 %). However, the prevalence of correct helmet use (defined as wearing a strapped standard helmet) gradually declined from 80.8 % in round 1–55.6 % in round 8. Results from a multinomial model showed the probability of wearing a strapped standard helmet had declined by 22.4 percentage points from round 3 to round 8 while holding other factors constant (95 % CI: 21.8–23.0). The prevalence of correct use is 11.3 percentage points higher for adults than for children (95 % CI: 10.5–12.1). During the same period, unstrapped standard helmet use increased by 24.5 percentage points (95 % CI: 24.1–24.9); substandard helmet use declined but remained high.
Conclusion
The upward trend of incorrect helmet wearing behaviors and wearing substandard helmets sends a rallying call for multisectoral interventions.}

Recent research has demonstrated that, generally, cyclists tend to deal with anger in constructive ways. However, when anger does manifest, it can result in behaviours that increase their crash risk. Amongst motor vehicle drivers, mindfulness levels have been associated with less anger and appear to mediate anger and associated aggression. The current study sought to understand whether mindfulness has similar associations with anger and aggression in a sample of cyclists. A total of 583 cyclists (males = 68 %) completed an online questionnaire that sought information on their levels of mindfulness, current mindfulness practices and tendencies for anger and aggression while cycling. The relationships between these were then examined using structural equation modelling. The results showed that cyclists with higher mindfulness levels tended to report less anger across a range of situations (e.g., interactions with pedestrians, cyclists, motor vehicle drivers and police). Both direct and indirect (through anger) relationships were found between mindfulness and aggression, again showing that more mindful cyclists tended to engage in less frequent aggression. These findings align with recent research investigating this relationship amongst motor vehicle drivers and suggest that mindfulness may be a promising strategy to reduce or avoid anger and aggression in cyclists.}

The current study had three aims: 1) describe distracted driving beliefs among adolescents by various distraction types (i.e., talking on a hands-free/hands-held cell phone, texting or emailing, taking “selfies,” and updating/checking social media); 2) examine the factor structure of distracted driving beliefs; and 3) test whether individual difference factors, shown in prior work to be related to distracted driving behavior, significantly predicted factors of distracted driving beliefs.
Methods
Three hundred seventy-nine high school students enrolled in non-mandatory Driver’s Education courses completed surveys of distracted driving beliefs, sensation seeking, and demographics.
Results
A factor analysis revealed four factors of distracted driving beliefs: 1) self-acceptance of interacting with a cell phone while driving; 2) perceived peer acceptance of interacting with a cell phone while driving; 3) perceived threat of distracted driving to personal safety; and 4) self- and peer- acceptance of talking on a cell phone while driving. Adolescents perceived a greater threat to safety and less self- and peer-acceptance of interacting with cell phones while driving (i.e., texting/emailing, updating/posting to social media, taking selfies) than talking on a cell phone while driving. In general, men, those with more driving experience, higher in sensation seeking, and those placing more importance on checking notifications on a phone had riskier beliefs about distracted driving.
Conclusion
Findings suggest adolescent distracted driving beliefs are influenced by individual difference factors, providing some knowledge about the motivations for distracted driving. Future work should consider novel strategies for intervening to reduce this common yet extremely dangerous behavior among adolescents.}

This is critical for the Arctic supply chains, considering the serious lack of experience, data, communication facilities, and that rules and regulations governing the region are at the embryonic stage. Understanding such, the study develops an effective risk assessment model in the context of the maritime supply chain and quantifies the risks associated with EWEs in the Arctic. The model is developed based on a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) that reflects a probabilistic risk priority index based on Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMEA). Here, we introduce a new index, based on a weighted combination of the likelihood, visibility, and consequence of risk factors. The model is quantified by 51 respondents based on their sailing experience with cargo carriers along the Northwest Passage. Our findings suggest that dense fog and ice accretion are distinctly critical risk factors followed by thunderstorm, hail and/or waterspouts, extreme coldness, and blizzard. The study offers useful insight to all right- and stakeholders in the Arctic. Moreover, it presents an effective tool to develop high-resolution maps for maritime routes considering important shipping elements.}

Previous studies involving MLs didn’t examine the impact of connected vehicles’ (CVs) lane configuration on freeway facilities with managed toll lanes. CVs are quickly expanding in the transportation industry and are among the most recent promising developments in traffic and safety engineering. In this study, several scenarios were tested using microscopic traffic simulation to determine the optimal CV lane configuration strategies while taking into consideration the market penetration rate (MPR%) of CVs and traffic conditions (i.e., peak, off-peak). Both safety (i.e., conflict frequency, conflict reduction) and operational (i.e., average speed, average delay) performance measures were included in the analyses. A Negative Binomial model was developed for investigating the factors that affect the safety measures. Tobit models were used to evaluate traffic operation. The results of the safety and operational analyses suggested that an MPR% between 10 % and 30 % was recommended when the CVs were only allowed in MLs. By converting one of the general-purpose lanes (GPLs) to a managed lane, the MPR% could reach 60 %. It was also concluded that restricting CVs to only the CV lane was not recommended. Lastly, the findings suggested that by allowing CVs to use all the lanes in the network (MLs, GPLs and CV lane), the optimal MPR% could reach between 70 % and 100 %. This study has major implications for improving MLs by recommending the optimal CV lane configuration and market penetration rate for each design.}

This study conducts an in-depth analysis of the transition condition of rear-end collisions. Realistic vehicle trajectory data were extracted from the Federal Highway Administration’s Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) datasets. The TTC index was utilized to pinpoint dangerous and transition conditions. A total of 13 types of transition conditions were categorized and a novel indicator, the derivative of TTC (TTCD), is proposed to evaluate changing rate of TTCs. Three types of TTCDs, corresponding to different time point or interval, were further analyzed based on developed regression models. The results indicate that: (1) although theoretically there are a total of 13 types of transition conditions, three types are dominant in practice; (2) the TTCD(t0) values at transition start points are significantly smaller than the TTCD(t1) at end points and the average TTCD(t0,t1), which indicates the quickest change of TTC values, while the TTCD(t1) has the slowest changes of TTC values; and (3) the following vehicle’s speed and acceleration rate, and speed difference and acceleration difference between two vehicles have significant effects on TTCDs. The influences are more remarkable of TTCD(t0) than those of TTCD(t1), and the  TTCD(t0,t1) always shows the average characteristic. Lastly, corresponding countermeasures are discussed based on findings above.}

There is different level of maturity with automation in different transport modes (road, aviation, maritime and rail), however no systematic research has been conducted on the lessons learned in different sectors, so that they can be exploited for the design of safer automated systems. The aim of this paper is to review the impact of key human factors on the safety of automated transport systems, with focus on relevant experiences from different transport sectors. A systematic literature review is carried out on the following topics: the level of trust in automation – in particular the impact of mis-aligned trust, i.e. mistrust vs overreliance, the resulting impact on operator situation awareness (SA), the implications for takeover control from machine to human, and the role of experience and training on using automated transport systems. The results revealed several areas where experiences from the aviation and road domain can be transferable to other sectors. Experiences from maritime and rail transport, although limited, tend to confirm the general patterns. Remarkably, in the road sector where higher levels of automation are only recently introduced, there are clearer and more quantitative approaches to human factors, while other sectors focus only on mental modes. Other sectors could use similar approaches to define their own context-specific metrics. The paper makes a synthesis of key messages on automation safety in different transport sectors, and presents an assessment of their transferability.}

Generally, existing literature on bicyclists and pedestrian crash models suffers from two distinct problems: lack of exposure/volume data and inadequacy in capturing potential correlations across various crash aspects. To develop a robust framework for pedestrian crash analysis, this research employed a multivariate model across multiple pedestrian crash severities incorporating a crucial piece of information: pedestrian exposure. A multivariate spatial (conditional autoregressive) Poisson-lognormal model in a Bayesian framework was developed to examine the significant factors influencing the fatal, incapacitating injury (or suspected serious injury), and non-incapacitating injury pedestrian crashes at 409 signalized intersections in the Austin area. Various explanatory variables were used to examine the pedestrian crashes, including traffic characteristics, road geometry, built environment features, and pedestrian exposure volume at intersections, which was estimated through a direct demand model as part of the study. Model results revealed valuable insights. The superior performance of the multivariate model over the univariate model emphasized the need to jointly model multiple pedestrian crash severities. The results showed the significant positive influence of speed limit on fatal pedestrian crashes and revealed that both incapacitating and non-incapacitating injury crashes increase with increasing motorized traffic volume. Bus stop presence was found to have a negative influence on incapacitating injury crashes and a positive influence on non-incapacitating injury crashes. Moreover, the pedestrian volume at intersections positively influences non-incapacitating injury crashes. The difference in influence across crash types warrants careful and focused policy design of intersections to reduce pedestrian crashes of all severity types.}

Regardless of the technique used to model crash, the mean crash frequency will increase with an increase in exposure since more crashes are likely to occur at higher exposure. For cyclist-vehicle crash models, bike and vehicle exposure measures are essential for an accurate and reliable estimate of the cyclist crash risk. However, traffic exposure measures are an example of variables that are measured with error. Generally, measurement error in regression estimates has three effects: 1) produce bias in parameter estimation for statistical models, 2) lead to a loss of explanation power, 3) mask important features of the data. This study proposes a full Bayesian Poisson Lognormal crash models that account for measurement error in traffic exposure measures (i.e., Vehicle Kilometers Travelled and Bike Kilometers Travelled). The underlying approach is to adjust the traffic exposure measures for measurement error to improve the accuracy of the crash model and crash model estimates. The full Bayesian models are developed using data for 134 traffic analysis zones (TAZs) in the city of Vancouver, Canada. The results show that Poisson Lognormal models that account for measurement error have a better fit for the modeled cyclist-vehicle crash data compared to traditional Poisson Lognormal models. The estimates of the Poisson Lognormal model that accounts for measurement error are consistent, with traditional Poisson Lognormal models’ estimates except for the BKT and VKT estimates. Estimates of the BKT and VKT increased after introducing measurement error, which indicates an underestimation (downward bias) to BKT and VKT estimates in case of overlooking measurement error.}

This interdisciplinary study explores factors that contribute to the perseverance of participants in an organizational "no phone use while driving" road-safety intervention.
Method
The study sample comprised 200 employees (mean age 43 years; 104 females [52 %], 96 males [48 %]) from 8 organizations in Israel. Subjects completed a 4-month organizational intervention using a smartphone application that monitored smartphone use, operationalized as taps per minute, where each tap represents a single instance of contact with the screen (e.g., touching, tapping or swiping). The app also silenced notifications during the intervention stage. Changes over time in tapping-while-driving behavior were examined through self-report questionnaires and objectively through the application’s monitoring function. Validated measures were used to examine factors associated with perseverance in the program.
Results
Organizational safety climate and gender (male) were positively related to perseverance in the intervention. Contrary to our hypothesis, safety motivation was not found to influence perseverance.
Conclusions
The present intervention is most effective for employees with high safety climate perceptions and for male employees.
Practical applications
The organizational intervention presented in the current study was shown to be effective in reducing smartphone use (touching, tapping or swiping) while driving. Our findings show that people will download and use an app that actively reduces their incentive to use their phones at the wheel by silencing incoming notifications. The findings support calls to harness the positive potential of information and communications technologies for organizational interventions.}

abstract = {Background
Using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Korean revised version (AUDIT-KR), we examined the association between habitual alcohol use and risk-taking behaviors among car users.
Methods
We used the data of 15,043 car users aged 20 years or older from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) conducted between 2009 and 2013. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the associations between alcohol use and risk-taking behaviors (i.e., driving under the influence of alcohol, riding in a car being driven under the influence, not wearing a seat belt while driving, not wearing a seat belt in the passenger seat), while adjusting for individual-level covariates.
Results
Compared to low-risk drinkers, high-risk drinkers (adjusted odds ratio [Adj.OR] 2.18, 95 % CI 1.96–2.42) and intermediate-risk drinkers (Adj.OR 1.39, 95 % CI 1.26–1.54) had higher odds of risk-taking behaviors while using a car. Stratifying by sociodemographic variables (i.e., sex, age, and region) led to differences in the relationship between alcohol-drinking level and risk-taking behaviors. Furthermore, alcohol-drinking level had significant positive associations with most of risk-taking behaviors, especially driving under the influence of alcohol and using a car with a drunken driver.
Conclusion
Car users with high levels of alcohol consumption are more likely to be involved in risk-taking behaviors, especially in driving under the influence of alcohol. While causal relations cannot be established due to the nature of the cross-sectional design, it is possible that individuals’ habitual alcohol consumption level can influence their risk-taking behaviors while using a car.}

Researchers continue to seek reasons for novice drivers’ over-representation in crashes. Evidence on how early interventions might mitigate this global phenomenon remains inconclusive. This study explores changes in novice drivers’ beliefs during pre-licensure training and within their first one-year independent provisional license period, and how these changes might help to predict subsequent risky driving.
Method
A sample of novice drivers (N = 175) from Lithuania participated in a three-wave longitudinal study. They completed questionnaires when beginning driver training (T1), at the end of their training (T2), and after one year of independent driving (T3). The Attitudes towards Risky Driving Questionnaire, the Adelaide Driving Self Efficacy Scale, the Driving Cognitions Questionnaire, the Driver Behaviour Questionnaire, and the Social Desirability Scale were used.
Results
Reported driving self-efficacy increased and fear of driving decreased from the beginning to the end of driver training and after one-year follow-up in both men and women. Road safety attitudes changed in the risk-unfavourable direction from T1 to T2. However, at T3 these attitudes returned to the initial level for men. Female novice drivers reported the same level of safety attitudes at T2 and T3. Risky attitudes, driving self-efficacy, and fear of driving predicted reported driving errors and violations.
Conclusions
Reported psychological changes occurred during the driver training period and in the first year of independent driving. It is recommended that special attention should be paid to a group of novices who experienced safety compromising changes in attitudes, driving self-efficacy, and fear of driving during training and in the first year of their driving career.}

A survey questionnaire was designed to collect data, including information regarding the extended variables, the basic components of the TPB and demographic characteristics. The survey was conducted in Xi'an, and 228 complete questionnaires were collected. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the data, and a multiple group analysis of the demographic variables was conducted. The results showed that the expanded TPB model had a better model fit and higher variance explanation than the original TPB model. Extended constructs, i.e., conformity tendency (CT) and the traffic environment (TE), were significant predictors, and attitude was the strongest predictor of all the examined variables related to RLR intentions. Finally, the path parameters of the expended TPB model were adapted for different demographic groups, and some differential effects were also found. These results could provide a basis for the design of intervention measures and safety education schemes by delivery platforms and traffic management departments to reduce RLR behavior among delivery riders.}

Behavioral study on drivers and pedestrians is the key to better understand the causes of pedestrian accidents in order to develop safety models. Despite numerous studies on pedestrian safety based on various roads, outskirt areas have not been considered. Hence, the present study focuses on evaluating the safety of pedestrian crossing in urban and outskirt areas and to determine the differences of drivers and pedestrians’ behaviors between these areas through data based on fixed videography (FV) and in-motion videography (IMV). These approaches may lead to an exact analysis of the behavioral differences of road users behaviors from the perspective of pedestrians (FV data) and drivers (IMV data) in urban and outskirts roads. Accordingly, behavioral studies were conducted at urban and outskirts sites through FV as well as IMV using the behavior of 29 participants in the same roads in Babol city, Iran. The gap acceptance model using linear regression and pedestrian crossing probability model using logistic regression for both approaches showed similarity on results in both urban and outskirts roads. Furthermore, behaviors of pedestrians crossing and drivers’ yielding on urban and outskirts roads were very similar. Vehicle speed, the distance of vehicle to pedestrian at the possible collision point, size of pedestrian groups, and waiting time before crossing were the most important behavioral differences of pedestrian for choosing a gap acceptance and probability of crossing on various sites through two different approaches. The inference of the models obtained in this study will lead to a better understanding of the behavior of road users for studies on advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS).}

The framework draws on existing literature in cognitive science about driver behaviour to explain experimental results from cycling field trials, and the modelling of these results. We modelled braking and steering manoeuvres from field data of cyclists’ obstacle avoidance within their comfort zone. Results show that when cyclists avoided obstacles by braking, they kept a constant deceleration; as speed increased, they started to brake earlier, farther from the obstacle, maintaining an almost constant time to collision. When cyclists avoided obstacles by steering, they maintained a constant distance from the object, independent of speed. Overall, the higher the speed, the more the steering manoeuvres were temporally delayed compared to braking manoeuvres. We discuss these results and other similarities between cyclist and driver behaviour during obstacle avoidance. Implications for the design of acceptable active safety and infrastructure design are also addressed.}

abstract = {Background
Trauma is one of the leading causes of death worldwide with millions of people dying each year, particularly in low or middle-income countries. This paper describes and evaluates the current trauma system (TS) in Saudi Arabia (SA).
Methods
A scoping literature review was performed, incorporating an extensive search of Medline and Embase databases for refereed literature, as well as a search of grey literature to locate unpublished articles or reports in English or Arabic. All publications were assessed against the World Health Organization (WHO) Trauma System Maturity Index (TSMI) and American College of Surgeon’s (ACS) criteria.
Results
Despite local injury prevention efforts, Motor Vehicle Crashes (MVC) remain the primary cause of injuries in SA. Prehospital trauma care in SA aligns with level III care as described in the WHO TSMI classification system, based on the presence of formal emergency medical services and universal access to care. With respect to the ACS classification, no clear written guidelines, either for field triage or trauma destination protocols such as trauma bypass, were identified in prehospital trauma care. The role of secondary and tertiary facilities in treating trauma patients is unclear, with no clear referral linkages, suggesting a level I to III grading of SA’s trauma care facilities. Currently, there is no national or regional electronic trauma registry, no quality assurance program, and active involvement in research projects related to injuries is limited.
Conclusion
The current SA TS has strengths but there are key features missing in comparison to other systems globally. As MVCs remain a leading cause of death/ disability, efforts to reduce the prevalence and impact of MVC burden in SA through development of a stronger national TS are warranted.}

Pseudo elasticity analysis is conducted to investigate significant impact factors and the temporal stability of model specifications is tested via a likelihood ratio test. The proposed model based on the seven-year dataset is able to capture the individual-specific heterogeneity across crash records for four significant factors, i.e., surface ice, male, and airbag combine deployment for minor injury, and male for serious injury and fatality. Their estimated parameters were found to be normal distribution instead of fixed value over the observations. Other significant impact factors with fixed effects are: inroad object, animal, overturn, surface wet, surface snow, unusual horizontal design, medium and high speed limits, driver age, impaired condition, no belt usage, vehicle type, airbag deployment. Especially, when compared to significant factors for crashes under other weather conditions, male indicator and impaired condition show significant higher effects in snow-related crashes. The results of temporal stability test show that the model specification is generally not temporally stable for driver injury severity model based on the years of crash data that were used, especially for longer period (more than 3-year dataset). Models that allow the explanatory variables to track temporal heterogeneity, are of great interest and can be explored in future research.}

The second one is examination of the performance of the new fuzzy decision approaches described in detail in this study for the classification of cyclist injury-severity. For this purpose, the data set containing bicycle-vehicle accidents in 2013–2017 was analyzed with the classic C4.5 algorithm and two different hybrid fuzzy decision mechanisms, namely DT-based converted FL (DT-CFL) and novel DT-based revised FL (DT-RFL). The model performances were compared according to their accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure values. The results indicated that the parameters that have the greatest effect on the injury-severity in bicycle-vehicle accidents are gender, vehicle damage-extent, road-type as well as the highly effective parameters such as pavement type, accident type, and vehicle-movement. The most successful classification performance among the three models was achieved by the DT-RFL model with 72.0 % F-measure and 69.96 % Accuracy. With 59.22 % accuracy and %57.5 F-measure values, the DT-CFL model, rules of which were created according to the splitting criteria of C4.5 algorithm, gave worse results in the classification of the injury-severity in bicycle-vehicle accidents than the classical C4.5 algorithm. In light of these results, the use of fuzzy decision mechanism models presented in this study on more comprehensive datasets is recommended for further studies.}

abstract = {Even with automated vehicles, driving situations with short time headways and extreme vehicle dynamics may arise when unpredictable events occur. If drivers take back control under such conditions, it is uncertain how they behave and how well they can cope with the situation. This issue has not been investigated yet and is subject to our study. In a driving simulator, non-distracted participants (N = 42) experienced nine critical situations caused by a braking vehicle in front of them. Time headway and longitudinal vehicle dynamics were varied to create different degrees of objective criticality. Participants’ criticality ratings, take-over behavior, and driving performance were recorded and analyzed. The results indicate that participants were sensitive to changes in objective criticality and adapted their behavior. Take-over times were very fast under all conditions and participants showed higher criticality ratings, more intense decelerations, and more lane changes with increasing objective criticality. To avoid a collision, participants decelerated much more than the automation and changed lanes, even though this was not necessary. Thereby, they raised the risk of vehicle instability, rear-end collisions, and collisions with overtaking vehicles. To conclude, take-overs in critical brake situations may be a threat to the safety of drivers and other road users because drivers’ reactions are more pronounced than necessary. These results suggest that assistive functions are required to support drivers in critical take-over situations.}

Using the data from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, a random parameters multinomial logit model of driver-injury severity was estimated to explore the effects of a wide range of variables on driver injury-severity outcomes. With three possible outcomes (no injury, injury, fatality), only single-vehicle crashes are considered and crashes involving domestic (Saudi) and international (non-Saudi) drivers were modeled separately. Model estimation results show that a wide range factors significantly affect the injury severity outcomes in single-vehicle crashes including driver attributes (such as nationality and age), vehicle characteristics (such as make, model and year of manufacture), driver actions (such as speeding and preoccupation on driving), and other factors (such as location and time of the accident); and that the influence that these variables have on injury-severity probabilities vary considerably between Saudi and non-Saudi drivers. While Saudi Arabia is rather unique because of the large numbers of non-national drivers, the results suggest that different nationalities, with their different cultural, educational and, behavioral backgrounds, may affect risk-taking behavior and resulting crash-injury severities.}

This study focuses on modeling crash frequencies specifically at the bus-service-route level, which is useful and important to policymakers and bus operation companies toward the improvement of the safety level of bus networks, especially for developing countries where buses are still a major mode of urban travels. Using the observed data adopted from one of the bus operating companies in Beijing, China, we proposed a spatiotemporal-random-effect zero-inflated negative binomial (spatiotemporal ZINB) model to investigate bus crash occurrence and identity key influential factors at the bus-service-route level. The model was motivated to accommodate the special statistical characteristics of the excessive zeros and, more importantly, the potential spatiotemporal correlations of the data. Three degenerated versions of this model were also developed for comparison purposes. Results indicate that the proposed spatiotemporal ZINB model is statistically superior to the others according to a comprehensive judgment based on the EAIC, EBIC, and RMSE criteria. The estimated coefficients reveal the impacts of related factors on the likelihood of bus-involved crashes from bus operation factors including total passengers, number of drivers, and proportion of male drivers as well as planning factors including route length and stop density. On the other hand, the standard deviations of the introduced structured and unstructured spatiotemporal random-effects are statistically significant indicating that the observations are correlated within each route, between neighbor routes and across years. Corresponding policy and practical implications are provided for bus operating companies and planning departments toward the improvement of bus safety.}

To date, research in this area has focused on the possible distractive effects of passengers. Although we know that drivers conversing on a mobile phone is distracting and unsafe, epidemiological studies suggest that driving with a passenger has a lower crash risk than driving alone. This paper describes two studies into how drivers and passengers interact during a journey; a survey regarding the most common actions of passengers and how drivers view their helpfulness, and an on-road study of driver and passenger interactions. The results indicated several areas that drivers felt passenger assistance was quite helpful, but in some cases was exhibited very rarely. The on-road study revealed some interesting gender differences in who offers driving support, and who requests it. By understanding how passengers can contribute to safer journeys we can provide that information to drivers at risk, such as those very early or late in their driving careers.}

The further application of microsimulation to the analysis of traffic safety in a systematic, rigorous, and controlled fashion is becoming increasingly viable as simulation models improve and tools for quantifying surrogate safety measures become readily accessible. Using a calibrated traffic microsimulation model and surrogate safety assessment model analysis, this paper examined how the risk for left-turn crashes varied as traffic conditions changed at a signalized intersection. Safety impacts for 750 unique combinations of intersection geometry, traffic, and signal timing parameters were simulated and the number of left-turn conflicts per hour noted. Results of the simulation analyses were used to develop statistical models that expressed the risk of occurrence of a left-turn crash during a given hour as a function of the left-turn phasing mode and prevailing conditions during that hour. The study was motivated by the recent widespread application of the flashing yellow arrow (FYA) which provides the opportunity to vary left-turn phasing mode by time of day—potentially leading to more efficient traffic operations at signalized intersections. In this regard, the study addresses a basic need for tools that predict how the risk for left-turn crashes might vary at a more disaggregated level than that provided by existing crash prediction models, which typically predict yearly totals of left-turn crashes, often based on annual average daily traffic volumes. Potential application of the model to the implementation of a time-variable safety-based left-turn phasing selection scheme using FYA was successfully demonstrated.}

However, little is known about vehicle passing distances at night or how they are affected by bicyclist visibility. This study assessed the impact of different bicyclist visibility configurations on vehicle passing distances at night-time. Fourteen licenced drivers with normal vision (age 24.2 ± 3.7 years) drove an experimental vehicle with low-beam headlights around a 1-km section of a closed-road circuit at night. Each lap involved passing two bicyclists displaying one of four visibility configurations: Control (red rear-facing light and reflector), Handlebars (control plus two red rear-facing lights on each handlebar), Helmet (control plus one red rear-facing light on the helmet), and Leg Retro-reflectors (control plus retro-reflective strips positioned on the knees and ankles). Participants were instructed to pass each bicyclist at a distance of 1-metre at a speed no greater than 50 km/hr, consistent with Queensland’s Minimum Passing Distance rule. Participants completed eight laps, two for each configuration, in a randomised sequence. Passing distance was measured using a vehicle-mounted ultra-sonic sensor (ToughSonic14; Senix). Following each lap, participants rated the difficulty level in judging the 1-metre passing distance, as well as their estimated passing distance. Visibility configuration significantly affected passing distance (p = 0.001), with wider passing distances for the Handlebar configuration (1.54 ± 0.62 m), followed by the Helmet (1.51 ± 0.63 m), Leg Retro-reflectors (1.50 ± 0.62 m) which were all significantly greater than the Control (1.42 ± 0.57 m), but not significantly different from each other. There was also a significant effect of visibility configuration on difficulty rating (p = 0.035), with the Control rated as the most difficult, followed by Helmet, Handlebars and Leg Retro-reflectors. Overall, additional visibility aids resulted in wider vehicle passing distances, likely due to enhanced visual cues for drivers. The findings suggest that bicyclists should incorporate additional visibility aids to encourage safer passing distances of vehicles at night-time.}

abstract = {Adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) is a novel traffic management system that is often deployed at high-volume intersections in order to mitigate traffic congestion and improve travel time reliability. While past studies have demonstrated its operational effectiveness, relatively few have focused on safety performance. Those that have tend to suffer from limitations including small sample sizes, insufficient study designs, or the lack of consideration of potential temporal and corridor effects after ATSC installation. Furthermore, results from previous studies are mixed: while many studies point to a safety improvement, more recent studies seem to indicate that ATSC systems might increase crash frequency. In light of this, a comprehensive Empirical Bayes (EB) before-after observational study was conducted using ATSC data collected throughout Pennsylvania. Crash modification factors (CMFs) were estimated based on the following different case scenarios: crash severity levels and crash types (total, fatal and injury, rear-end, and angle crashes); intersection locations (all intersections and intersections along corridors only); and, intersection configurations (3-leg and 4-leg). Temporal trends for intersection-level CMFs were examined using annual crash data in the after period. Corridor-level CMFs were also developed to quantify changes in safety performance along corridors with ATSC installed. The results suggest that ATSC is associated with a nominal increase in total and angle crashes, and an expected decrease in fatal plus injury crashes and rear-end crashes. However, the results were not statistically significant. The safety effect estimates are similar when considering intersection locations and configurations. In addition, the temporal trend analysis indicates that the safety effectiveness does not vary annually in the after period, suggesting no obvious novelty effect associated with ATSC. Finally, the magnitude of the corridor-level CMFs are slightly lower than the intersection-level CMFs, except for rear-end crashes.}

Understanding the associations between trip/driving/roadways features and speeding behavior is crucial for both researchers and practitioners. This research utilized naturalistic driving data collected by the Safety Pilot Model Deployment (SPMD) program and roadway features from a road inventory dataset - Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS), provided by the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT), to investigate the hidden rules that associated trip/driving/roadway features with speeding behavior. A classification-based association (CBA) algorithm was adopted to explore the hidden rules from two perspectives of speeding: speeding duration and speeding pattern. Results indicate that the combinations of longer trips (more than 60 min), driving on the roadways with a relatively higher functional class are highly associated with longer speeding events (speeding longer than 2 min). The moderate speeding events (speeding longer than 2 min and longer than 30 s) are found highly associated with the combination of driving on roadways with lower functional class, absence of a median and relatively short trip time (less than 30 min). The research also found the combinations of driving on roadways with relatively lower functional class, experienced congestion before a speeding event, and the presence of a median is a leading cause that triggers a higher speeding pattern (speeding more than 5mph above the speed limit). Furthermore, the moderate speeding pattern (speeding more than 1mph above the speed limit and less than 5mph of the speed limit) is associated with the combinations of factors like experiencing congestion before a speed event, driving on roadways with higher functional class and a relatively shorter trip (less than 30 min). The findings can help practitioners understand the composite effect of these factors more comprehensively and provide corresponding countermeasures to mitigate the negative consequences of speeding wherever possible. These can also help in calibrating driver behavior parameters for transportation-related simulation tools.}

To improve the traffic safety pro-actively, this study proposes a safety-oriented ATSC algorithm to optimize traffic efficiency and safety simultaneously. A multi-objective deep reinforcement learning framework is utilized as the backend algorithm. The proposed algorithm was trained and evaluated on a simulated isolated intersection built based on real-world traffic data. A real-time crash prediction model was calibrated to provide the safety measure. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated by the real-world signal timing provided by the local jurisdiction. The results showed that the algorithm improves both traffic efficiency and safety compared with the benchmark. A control policy analysis of the proposed ATSC revealed that the abstracted control rules could help the traditional signal controllers to improve traffic safety, which might be beneficial if the infrastructure is not ready to adopt ATSCs. A hybrid controller is also proposed to provide further traffic safety improvement if necessary. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the proposed algorithm is the first successful attempt in developing adaptive traffic signal system optimizing traffic safety.}

In Colombia, road traffic injuries are the second leading source of mortality by external causes and constitute a significant public health concern in the city of Bogotá. Bogotá is among the top 10 most bike-friendly cities in the world. However, bicyclists are one of the most vulnerable road-users in the city. Therefore, assessing the pattern of mortality and understanding the variables affecting the outcome of bicyclists’ collisions in Bogotá is crucial to guide policies aimed at improving safety conditions. This study aims to determine the spatiotemporal trends in fatal and nonfatal collision rates and to identify the individual and contextual factors associated with fatal outcomes. We use confidence intervals, geo-statistics, and generalized additive mixed models (GAMM) corrected for spatial correlation. The collisions’ records were taken from Bogotá’s Secretariat of Mobility, complemented with records provided by non-governmental organizations (NGO). Our findings indicate that from 2011 to 2017, the fatal bicycling collision rates per bicyclists’ population have remained constant for females while decreasing 53 % for males. Additionally, we identified high-risk areas located in the west, southwest, and southeast of the city, where the rate of occurrence of fatal events is higher than what occurs in other parts of the city. Finally, our results show associated risk factors that differ by sex. Overall, we find that fatal collisions are positively associated with factors including collisions with large vehicles, the absence of dedicated infrastructure, steep terrain, and nighttime occurrence. Our findings support policy-making and planning efforts to monitor, prioritize, and implement targeted interventions aimed at improving bicycling safety conditions while accounting for gender differences.}

Impact scenarios were set according to ISO, 13232 regulation considering impact angles and impact speeds. Five vehicle types of Sedan, MPV (Multi-Purpose Vehicle), SUV (Sport Utility Vehicle), EV (Electric Vehicle) and 1-Box vehicle were included. HIC15 (Head Injury Criterion), head angular acceleration and CSDM (Cumulative Strain Damage Measure) were calculated to evaluate head injury risk of the motorcyclist. The results show that the critical impact speed for HIC15 and head angular acceleration was around 15 m/s, while the critical speed for CSDM was approximately 10 m/s. Impact angle of 45° show extremely high injury risk to the motorcyclist head. Bonnet leading edge height and its combination with other parameter present high influences on motorcyclist head injuries, and the increasing the bonnet leading edge height can potentially reduce head injury risk of motorcyclists. In summary, the present research results provide some theoretic bases for determining the test speed in motorcycle-vehicle crash regulation and design consideration for typical vehicle front end shape.}

If the risk associated with different traffic elements (i.e., road, environment and vehicles) could be evaluated accurately, potential accidents could be significantly avoided or mitigated. This paper proposes a driving risk assessment model that can quantitatively evaluate the driving risk associated with intelligent vehicles via the coupled analysis of different traffic elements. First, we present a concept of the internal field and external field for establishing the driving risk coupling model, through employing the internal field to define the risk range of driver’s perspective and the external field to calculate the risk coefficients of those traffic elements. Then, the relative risk coefficients are computed by incorporating both naturalistic driving study (NDS) and driver attitude questionnaire (DAQ) using a multinomial logit model. Specifically, we perform a large-scale naturalistic driving study to investigate the objective driving risks. Typical driver behavior parameters, such as velocity, time headway, and acceleration, are analyzed. Besides, a self-reported survey of 364 drivers is conducted to subjectively evaluate the potential risks that drivers may face in various situations. Finally, validation of the model is conducted by comparing the accuracy with the typical risk assessment index, i.e., TTC and THW. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective in evaluating the comprehensive driving risks by quantifying the influence factors of driving risks in dynamic environments.}

First, data from the IGLAD database were analyzed and divided into four categories based on differences in traffic environments among countries and regions. Second, according to actual accident characteristics, fields and methods of clustering were selected, and 21 typical pre-crash scenarios were obtained using clustering and analysis. Finally, the typical scenarios were analyzed and compared in detail. Four conclusions were drawn as follows: 1. Considerable differences exist in traffic participant types, accident forms, and typical scenarios across countries and regions. 2. The third group of countries (3-G, represented by China and Brazil) in which accidents and pre-crash scenarios are the most representative and diverse is an ideal data source for the international scenario research. 3. The typical scenarios mined through clustering were highly consistent with the new test scenarios added in the Euro-NCAP 2025 Roadmap, but a few typical scenario elements which are critical for safety evaluations were still not covered in Roadmap. 4. Data from the IGLAD database still lacks a few important pieces of information for scenario research, such as obstruction of visual field due to obstacles, and the data representativeness need to be improved, therefore we recommend that IGLAD database adds some new data parameters to fit the further scenario research, and propose distribution requirements of accident data considering scenario elements. The analysis methods and conclusions presented used in this study could serve as guidelines or references for automated vehicle safety evaluations.}

Previous research has found that hazardous sites identified with different methods are not consistent. It is therefore necessary to evaluate the performance of various HSID methods. The existing evaluation criteria are limited to two consecutive periods, and do not consider the temporal instability of crashes. In addition, one existing criterion does not precisely evaluate HSID method under given circumstances. This paper proposed three generalized criteria to evaluate the performance of HSID methods: (1) High Crashes Consistency Test (HCCT) is proposed to evaluate HSID methods in terms of their reliabilities of identifying sites with high crash counts; (2) Common Sites Consistency Test (CSCT) is proposed to gauge HSID methods in consistently identifying a set of common sites as hazardous sites; and, (3) Absolute Rank Differences Test (ARDT) is proposed to measure the consistency of HSID methods in measuring the absolute differences in rankings. Further, three commonly used HSID methods are applied to estimate crashes on Texas rural two-lane roadway segments with eight years of crash data. The performance of these three HSID methods were evaluated to validate the proposed criteria. Comparisons between the existing criteria and the generalized criteria revealed that: (1) the generalized criteria are capable of evaluating different HSID methods over multiple periods; and (2) the generalized criteria are enhanced with a consistent result and with less discrepancy in scores of the best identified HSID method.}

abstract = {Increasing automation calls for evaluating the effectiveness and intelligence of automated vehicles. This paper proposes a framework for quantitatively evaluating the intelligence of automated vehicles. Firstly, we establish the evaluation environment for automated vehicles including test field, test task, and evaluation index. The test tasks include the single vehicle decision-making (turning, lane-changing, overtaking, etc.) and the maneuver execution of multi-vehicle interaction (obstacle avoidance, trajectory optimization, etc.). The intelligence evaluation index is the action amount of driving process considering the safety, efficiency, rationality and comfort. Then, we calculate the actual action amount of the automated vehicle in different scenarios in the test field. Finally, the least action calculated theoretically corresponds to the highest intelligence degree of the automated vehicle, and is employed as a standard to quantify the performance of other tested automated vehicles. The effectiveness of this framework is verified with two naturalistic driving datasets that contain the normal driving scenarios and high-risk scenarios. Specifically, the naturalistic lane-changing data filters 40,416 frames and 179 similar lane-changing trajectories. Compared with the lane-changing behavior of a large number of drivers, experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm can achieve the intelligence degree of drivers in the lane change scenario. Meanwhile, in 253 reconstructed high-risk scenarios, the intelligent risk avoidance ability of the proposed intelligence degree evaluation algorithm can be verified by comparing with the driver behavior and TTC algorithm. These experimental results show that the proposed framework can effectively quantify intelligence and evaluate the performance of automated vehicles under various scenarios.}

We herein propose a risk index (RI) that combines the invisibility probability and the crash impact as a performance measure for evaluating the safety of the geometric designs of roundabouts, and we also describe a method for calculating this index. Invisibility probability represents the probability that an entering vehicle cannot view a vehicle coming from the upstream in a circulatory roadway and crash impact represents the amount of lost kinetic energy at the time of collision corresponds to the impact of the crash. A numerical simulation to model this RI on the basis of various geometric conditions is further presented. It is demonstrated that the invisibility probability is large when the entry angle is small and that the crash impact increases when the deviation angle decreases. The proposed approach is expected to help resolve issues with currently existing roundabouts and improve the design of future roundabouts to enhance their safety performance.}

The weighted pooled volume coefficient for all crashes and all levels of crash severity (excluding fatal crashes) is 0.875. The most important moderator variable is crash type. Pooled volume coefficients are systematically greater for multi vehicle crashes (1.210) than for single vehicle crashes (0.552). Regarding crash severity, the results indicate that volume coefficients are smaller for more fatal crashes (0.777 for all fatal crashes) than for injury crashes but no systematic differences were found between volume coefficients for injury and property-damage-only crashes. At higher levels of volume and on divided roads, volume coefficients tend to be greater than at lower levels of volume and on undivided roads. This is consistent with the finding that freeways on average have greater volume coefficients than other types of road and that two-lane roads are the road type with the smallest average volume coefficients. The results indicate that results from crash prediction models are likely to be more precise when crashes are disaggregated by crash type, crash severity, and road type. Disaggregating models by volume level and distinguishing between divided and undivided roads may also improve the precision of the results. The results indicate further that crash prediction models may be misleading if they are used to predict crash numbers on roads that differ from those that were used for model development with respect to composition of crash types, share of fatal or serious injury crashes, road types, and volume levels.}

The current study reports on a survey of 2774 drivers (47.0 % males) that own and regularly use a smartphone. The survey analysed the self-reported frequency of illegal smartphone use while driving, perceptions of formal and informal deterrence mechanisms, differences between perceived and informed deterrence, and deterrent predictors of illegal use. The findings revealed that illegal smartphone use is increasing in Victoria, Australia. Drivers that break the law perceive deterrent mechanisms significantly different from drivers that abide by the law, however, both groups view the prospect of hurting oneself as most impactful. Additionally, drivers tend to underestimate the consequences of illegal use, yet overestimate the certainty of apprehension. A binary logistic regression analysis revealed that only age, gender and informal sanctions such as social loss (stigma/peer disapproval), internal loss (shame/guilt/embarrassment), and physical loss (injury/property damage) were significant predictors of illegal use. None of the formal mechanisms were significant. Based on these findings, road safety interventions and future research should consider exploring the psychological characteristics of young people’s perceptions of informal sanctions such as social loss (shame/embarrassment) and internal loss (guilt).}

While a great deal of research has been undertaken to understand the relationships between crash involvement, behaviours and personality traits for motor vehicle drivers, comparatively few studies have considered these factors for cyclists. This manuscript presents the findings of a study conducted amongst a sample of six hundred and fifteen (615) Australian cyclists, investigating these issues. The aim of this research was to establish a structure for a cycling behaviour questionnaire applicable to a cohort of Australian cyclists. Using the dimensions identified from the questionnaire, the research investigated the relationship between self-reported crashes, behaviours and personality traits, in order to further develop our understanding of risk factors associated with cycling. Personality traits (agreeableness, extroversion, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness to experience) were measured using the Big Five Inventory. While cyclist behaviour was measured using a modified version of the cyclist behaviour questionnaire developed by the Dutch national road safety research centre (SWOV). Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was performed on the cycling behaviour questionnaire to identify underlying subscales of behaviour. The PCA identified a two dimension model representing violations (α = 0.74) and errors (α = 0.65), consisting of 16 items from the original 22 item cyclist behaviour questionnaire. Linear regressions for each of the cyclist behaviour factors identified that age was negatively associated with errors and violations, indicating that older cyclists report fewer errors or violations. Similarly, there was a negative association with average weekly kilometres travelled. Gender was a significant predictor of errors, but not violations, with male cyclists reporting fewer errors than females. When considering personality traits, there was a positive association between extroversion and both errors and violations. Significant negative associations were identified for agreeableness and conscientiousness. Neither neuroticism nor openness to experience were associated with the frequency of errors or violations. The research identified that demographics, travel characteristics and personality traits provide insight into engagement in aberrant cycling behaviours and these behaviours are associated with self-reported crash involvement. The research provides insight into behaviours that could be targeted with appropriate education and enforcement strategies.}

This paper used full Bayesian mixed logit models to quantify the impact that ATM deployment had on crash severities. The estimation results revealed lower severities with ATM deployment. Marginal effects for ATM deployments that featured hard shoulder running (HSR) revealed lower likelihoods for severe and moderate injury crashes of 15.9 % and for minor injury crashes of 10.1 %. The likelihood of severe and moderate injury crashes and minor injury crashes reduced by 12.4 % and 8.33 % with ATM without HSR. The models were observed to be temporally transferable and had forecast error of 0.301 and 0.304 for the two models, revealing better performance with validation data. These results have implications for improving freeway crash risk at critical locations.}

abstract = {Guardrails were designed to deter vehicle access to off-road areas and consequently prevent hitting rigid fixed objects alongside the road (e.g. trees, utility poles, traffic barriers, etc.). However, guardrails cause 10 % of deaths in vehicle-to-fixed-object crashes, which recently attracted attention in the highway safety community on the vehicle-based injury criteria used in regulations. The objectives of this study were to investigate both full-body and body-region driver injury probabilities using finite element (FE) simulations, to quantify the influence of pre-impact conditions on injury probabilities, and to analyze the relationship between the vehicle-based crash severity metrics currently used in regulations and the injury probabilities assessed using dummy-based injury criteria. A total of 20 FE impact simulations between a car (Toyota Yaris) with a Hybrid III M50 dummy model in the driver seat and an end terminal model (ET-Plus) were performed in various configurations (e.g. pre-impact velocities, offsets, and angles). The driver’s risk of serious injuries (AIS 3+) was estimated based on kinematic and kinetic responses of the dummy during the crashes. A non-linear regression approach was used to compare the injury probabilities assessed in this study to the vehicle-based crash severity metrics used in the testing regulations. In particular, the US Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware (MASH) guideline and European procedures (EN1317) were used for the study. All the recorded dummy-based injury criteria values pass the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 208 limits which indicated a low driver risk of serious injury. Overall, the pre-impact vehicle velocity showed to have the highest influence in almost all injury probabilities (59 %, 79 %, 62 %, and 44 % in full-body, head, neck, and chest injuries, respectively). The offset between vehicle midline and the guardrail barrier was the most important variable for thigh injuries (56 %). The assessed injury probabilities were compared to vehicle-based severity metrics. The full-body and chest injuries showed the highest correlation with Occupant Impact Velocity (OIV), Acceleration Severity Index (ASI), and Theoretical Head Impact Velocity (THIV) (R2 > 0.6). Lower correlations of thigh injuries were recorded to OIV (R2 = 0.59) and THIV (R2 = 0.46). Meanwhile, weak correlations were observed between all the other regressions which indicated that no vehicle-based criteria could be used to predict head and neck injuries. Car-to-end terminal crash FE simulations involving a dummy model were performed for the first time in this study. The results pointed out the limitations of the standard vehicle-based injury methods in terms of head and neck injury prediction. The dummy-based injury assessment methodology presented in this study could supplement the crash tests for various impact conditions. In addition, the models could be used to design new advanced guardrail end terminals.}

Vehicle stability and safety can deteriorate significantly by a sudden tire failure. The current body of literature on tire failure-related crashes is limited, and no previous study was found to extensively investigate the factors associated with tire failures and the corresponding injury severity. The contributions of this study include (i) investigating the factors affecting tire failures, (ii) assessing the impacts of tire failures on occupant injury severity, and (iii) demonstrating the necessity of statewide tire inspection regulations. An extensive exploratory analysis was performed using ten years (2007−2016) of historical crash data along I-80 in Wyoming. Binary logistic regression with the Bayesian inference approach was applied to develop two separate models: tire failure and injury severity model. The results from the tire failure model showed that vehicle speeds greater than 75 mph, commercial motor vehicles, summer season, daytime, the presence of rough surface, downgrades, and concrete pavement are all related to higher tire failure occurrences. On the other hand, the incidence of a tire failure in a crash significantly contributed to more severe injuries when combined with any of the following instances: fire or explosion, rollover, guardrail hits, runoff road, angle, rear-end, clear weather, speeding, downgrades, and curved segments. With the incorporation of the random intercept in the modeling procedure, the injury severity analysis found a strong presence (42 %) of intra-crash correlation (effects of the common crash-specific unobserved factors) in occupant injury severity within the same crash. Finally, based on the findings of the study, recommendations are provided to alleviate tire-related problems.}

As one of the key goals of AVs, pedestrian safety is an important issue in China. Despite the rapid development of driverless technologies in recent years, there is a lack of researches on the adaptability of AVs to pedestrians. To fill the gap, this study would discuss the adaptability of current driverless technologies to China urban pedestrians by reviewing the latest researches. The paper firstly analyzed typical Chinese pedestrian behaviors and summarized the safety demands of pedestrians for AVs through articles and open database data, which are worked as the evaluation criteria. Then, corresponding driverless technologies are carefully reviewed. Finally, the adaptability would be given combining the above analyses. Our review found that autonomous vehicles have trouble in the occluded pedestrian environment and Chinese pedestrians do not accept AVs well. And more explorations should be conducted on standard human-machine interaction, interaction information overload avoidance, occluded pedestrians detection and nation-based receptivity research. The conclusions are very useful for motor corporations and driverless car researchers to place more attention on the complexity of the Chinese pedestrian environment, for transportation experts to protect pedestrian safety in the context of AVs, and for governors to think about making new pedestrians policies to welcome the upcoming driverless cars.}

In this study, a driving simulator experiment was conducted to investigate the safety of RPMs in a freeway tunnel. Two different RPM layouts were designed and compared to a control with no RPMs, and 32 drivers participated in the driving simulator experiments. The speed, relative speed difference, lateral position, accelerator power, acceleration, and pupil area were used as indicators of the response characteristics of drivers to RPMs, and the interaction of tunnel length, tunnel zone, and RPM alternatives was discussed. The results indicate that a significant interaction effect exists between tunnel length, tunnel zone, and RPM alternatives. RPMs could help reduce driver anxiety, boredom, and fatigue caused by the dark and monotonous tunnel driving environment, and improve driver alertness and consciousness of speed. Also, the driving risk increases with increasing tunnel length (1800 m to 3500 m).}

The videos were shown from a first-, second-, or third-person perspective. Some videos depicted close following, varying in speed and distance from the car ahead. Participants also saw illegal passing videos and collision or near collision videos. A number of variables that might influence judgments of aggressive driving were included as controls (i.e., trait anger, aggressive and prosocial driving attitudes, driving experience). Following other drivers closely was rated as aggressive, especially when viewed from a third-person perspective. Illegal passes were viewed as more aggressive than speeding. Faster speeds didn’t increase aggressive ratings much, regardless of perspective. Aggressiveness ratings were especially high for acts that could be considered “road rage” (i.e., hitting or nearly hitting vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians). People high in trait anger have a bias to view many driving behaviors as intentionally aggressive.}

Within the counterfactual framework, propensity score matching is used to balance the covariates between treatment and control groups. Recent studies in traffic safety research have demonstrated the strength of this method in reducing the bias caused by treatment site selection. However, several general issues associated with safety effect estimates may still influence the effectiveness and robustness of this method. In the present study, Bayesian methods were integrated into the propensity score matching method. Bayesian models are known for their ability to capture heterogeneity and modeling uncertainty. This may help mitigate unobserved variable effects in the roadway and crash data. Furthermore, the sampling-based algorithm used for Bayesian estimation yields more consistent estimates in small region analysis than estimates from frequentist modeling. In this study, a dataset that was used to evaluate the safety effects of the dual application of shoulder and centerline rumble strips on two-lane rural highways was acquired. Only data from the before treatment period were used in a no-treatment effect analysis in order to compare the results of a Bayesian propensity score analysis to a frequentist propensity score analysis. Because no treatment was applied during the analysis period, it was assumed that there would be no treatment effect, or a crash modification factor equal to 1.0. The Bayesian propensity score matching method nominally outperformed the frequentist propensity score matching method in the largest sample and produced near-identical results in the medium sample, but neither method closely approximated the assumed, true crash modification factor in the small sample analysis. A simulation study is recommended to further study the effects of sample size and confounding factors when comparing the Bayesian and frequentist propensity score matching methods.}

Existing studies on work zone traffic safety with statistical approaches are limited by the availability of data from historical crashes. To date, there is no comprehensive simulation framework to assess work zone traffic safety under adverse driving environments by considering both multi-vehicle and single-vehicle crashes. To fill this gap, this paper presents an integrated framework to evaluate traffic safety in work zone under adverse driving conditions by considering specific work zone configuration, weather and road surface conditions. A new risk index is introduced to assess the traffic safety risk of work zones by integrating the risks of multi-vehicle crashes and single-vehicle crashes. Traffic safety of a typical work zone under different weather conditions is studied to demonstrate the proposed framework. The impacts of the differential speed limits (DSL) and truck proportion on the work zone traffic safety are also investigated. Results show that adverse weather may increase the crash risk in work zones. The effect of DSL on the work zone traffic safety is found to be insignificant while the truck ratio influences the work zone safety in the rainy and snowy weather by primarily affecting the multi-vehicle crash risks.}

This makes them twice as likely to be involved in, or cause, vehicle crashes compared to their older and more experienced counterparts. This study aims to address this societal issue by developing a better understanding of the German young driver problem. For this purpose, we created an updated, 55-item strong version of the Behaviour of Young Novice Drivers Scale (BYNDS), originally developed by Scott-Parker et al. in 2010. To make the new version of the BYNDS understandable for German young novice drivers, this research used a new method of translation in combination with extensive pre-testing. As a result, we identified possible threats for response errors such as retrospective formulated questions or double negations. Due the adjustment of the possible sources of error the presented version of the BYNDS is semantically and conceptually different from the original. However, due to the application of the updated version of the BYNDS in a robust sample of 700 participants, this paper presents the first reliable and validated tool to measure novices risky driving behaviour in Germany. Moreover, it offers an updated and extended version of the BYNDS that allows practitioners but also researchers to broaden their understanding of young driver risk.}

abstract = {Speeding behaviour has been shown to account for a large number of deaths and serious injuries on Australian roads. Vehicle impoundment is one countermeasure which has been implemented to discourage drivers from engaging in high-range speeding. Despite this countermeasure being used as a sanction in all Australian jurisdictions to combat high-range speeding offences, limited research has examined the effectiveness of vehicle impoundments in Australia. The purpose of this research was to examine the effectiveness of vehicle impoundment for high-range speeding offences on subsequent offence and crash rates. Data were collected from drivers with an eligible excessive speeding offence in Victoria, Australia between 1 July 2006 and 31 December 2014. During this time, there were 17,440 impoundment eligible offences, 6,883 (41.8 %) of which resulted in vehicle impoundment. The analysis revealed that drivers who had a vehicle impounded were more likely to be male, younger, hold a probationary licence, and to have a court offence. In terms of the effectiveness of vehicle impoundment, among high-range offenders, re-offence rates for those who had their vehicle impounded were statistically significantly lower for all licence periods compared with offenders who did not have their vehicle impounded. There was evidence of an effect of impoundment on reducing speeding re-offence rates during the impoundment period as well as some evidence that the impact of licence suspension was greater for those who experienced impoundment. Given that vehicle impoundment is a sanction which aims to discourage and/or incapacitate drivers from engaging in on-road risk taking behaviour, in this case high-range speeding behaviour, the longer-term positive effects of this sanction may assist with the on-going effort to reduce on-road risk taking behaviours.}

abstract = {With only ∼20 % of bicycling crashes captured in official databases, studies on bicycling safety can be limited. New datasets on bicycling incidents are available via crowdsourcing applications, with opportunity for analyses that characterize reporting patterns. Our goal was to characterize patterns of injury in crowdsourced bicycle incident reports from BikeMaps.org. We extracted 281 incidents reported on the BikeMaps.org global mapping platform and analyzed 21 explanatory variables representing personal, trip, route, and crash characteristics. We used a balanced random forest classifier to classify three outcomes: (i) collisions resulting in injury requiring medical treatment; (ii) collisions resulting in injury but the bicyclist did not seek medical treatment; and (iii) collisions that did not result in injury. Results indicate the ranked importance and direction of relationship for explanatory variables. By knowing conditions that are most associated with injury we can target interventions to reduce future risk. The most important reporting pattern overall was the type of object the bicyclist collided with. Increased probability of injury requiring medical treatment was associated with collisions with animals, train tracks, transient hazards, and left-turning motor vehicles. Falls, right hooks, and doorings were associated with incidents where the bicyclist was injured but did not seek medical treatment, and conflicts with pedestrians and passing motor vehicles were associated with minor collisions with no injuries. In Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, bicycling safety would be improved by additional infrastructure to support safe left turns and around train tracks. Our findings support previous research using hospital admissions data that demonstrate how non-motor vehicle crashes can lead to bicyclist injury and that route characteristics and conditions are factors in bicycling collisions. Crowdsourced data have potential to fill gaps in official data such as insurance, police, and hospital reports.}

A total of 96 participants completed the study, ranging in age from 18 to 76 years. On sections of roads containing billboards, participants drove at lower mean speeds (p < 0.001), had more speed variability (p < 0.001), more variability in lane position (p < 0.001), more time spent at high risk headway < two seconds (p = 0.013), more time spent at high risk headway <0.25 s (p = 0.002) and had more visual fixations (p = 0.01), compared to control sections of road with no billboards. Billboards with simple (versus complex) content presented at a long dwell time (60 s versus 40 or 20 s) had the least negative impact on driving outcomes. Billboards with complex content had similar negative effects on driving, regardless of dwell time. In addition, post-mounted roadside billboards (versus bridge mounted) with 60 s dwell times had the least negative impact on driving. While the presence of digital billboards negatively affected driving performance, simple billboard content and longer dwell times were safer. The results of the study will assist in the development of evidence-based guidelines for digital billboards.}

The increasingly abundant crowdsourcing data and floating car data provide new support for improving traffic accident management. This paper investigates the methods to predict the complicated behavior of traffic flow evolution after traffic accidents using crowdsourcing data. Based on the available data source, the traffic condition is divided into four levels by congestion delay index: severely congested, congested, slow moving and uncongested. Four types of accidents are consequently defined based on the occurrence of each level. A hierarchical scheme is designed for identifying the most congested level and sequentially predicting duration of each level. The proposed model is validated using traffic accident data in 2017 from an anonymous source in Beijing, China by embedding three machine learning algorithms, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and neural network (NN), in the scheme. The results show NN outperforms the other two models when the assessment is conducted in absolute differences. Meanwhile, RF has a slightly better performance than SVM, especially when predicting the short-period congestion of severely congested level at the first time. By continuously updating the traffic condition information, significant improvement in accuracy can be acquired regardless of the exact model used. This study shows that emerging crowdsourcing data can be used in a real-time analysis of traffic accidents and the proposed model is effective to analyze such data.}

To allow the driver to obtain sufficient exit information in time and get off the freeway safely, this study proposes the creation of a guardrail painted with a yellow color and located prior to the exit. The yellow color guardrail belt (YCB) aims at informing the drivers that there is an exit ahead and to pay attention to the exit information, reminding them to adjust vehicle state and driving behavior in time. A driving simulator experiment with two different scenarios (YCB scenario and baseline scenario with no YCB) were used to explore the effectiveness of the YCB. Data on eye movement, electroencephalograph, and driving behavior of the participants were obtained. The results showed that compared with the baseline scenario, in the YCB scenario, the fixation points were mainly distributed in front of the road and the fixation duration on the guide signs was relatively longer; the EEG ratio (θ + α) / β was smaller; the driver decelerated more smoothly; and the steering wheel angle was smaller. In addition, the statistical analysis showed that there were significant differences in the fixation duration, the EEG ratio (θ + α) / β, and steering wheel angle between the two scenarios. This indicated that participants’ vigilance in the YCB scenario was significantly improved, where the participants paid more attention to the guide signs and had better control of the vehicle. This study recommends a new device for reminding drivers to pay attention to freeway exits, which would greatly stimulate driver's sense of space on the exit and improve traffic safety on freeways.}

abstract = {Although the enforcement of seatbelt use is considered to be an effective strategy in reducing road injuries and fatalities, lack of seatbelt use still accounts for a substantial proportion of fatal crashes in Tennessee, United States. This problem has raised the need to better understand factors influencing seatbelt use. These factors may arise from spatial/temporal characteristics of a driving location, type of vehicle, demographic and socioeconomic attributes of the vehicle occupants, driver behaviours, attitudes, and social norms. However, the above factors may not have the same effects on seatbelt use across different individuals. In addition, the behavioural factors are usually difficult to measure and may not always be readily available. Meanwhile, residential locations of vehicle occupants have been shown to be associated with their behavioural patterns and thus may serve as a proxy for behavioural factors. However, the suitability of geographic and residential locations of vehicle occupants to understand the seatbelt use behaviour is not known to date. This study aims to fill the above gaps by incorporating the residential location characteristics of vehicle occupants in addition to their demographics and crash characteristics into their seatbelt use while accounting for the varying effects of these factors on individual seatbelt use choices. To achieve this goal, empirical data are collected for vehicular crashes in Tennessee, United States, and the home addresses of vehicle occupants at the time of the crash are geocoded and linked with the census tract information. The resulting data is then used as explanatory variables in a latent class binary logit model to investigate the determinants of vehicle occupants’ seatbelt use at the time of the crash. The latent class specification is employed to capture the unobserved heterogeneity in data. Results show that Tennessean drivers belong to two general categories—conformist and eccentric—with gender, vehicle type, and income per capita determining the likelihood of these categories. Overall, male drivers, younger drivers, and drivers who have consumed drugs are less likely to wear a seatbelt, whereas drivers who come from areas with higher population density, travel time, and income per capita are more likely to wear a seatbelt. In addition, driving during the day and in rainy weather are associated with an increased likelihood of seatbelt use. The findings of this study will help developing effective policies to increase seatbelt use rate and improve safety.}

Two modeling techniques were explored, the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (COM-Poisson) model (to accommodate bicycle-vehicle crash under-dispersion) and a machine learning technique, the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). MARS is a non-black-box model and can effectively handle non-linear crash predictors and interactions. A total of 1,311 bicycle-vehicle crashes from 2011 through 2015 in Alabama were collected and their respective police reports were reviewed in details. Results from the SPFs for roadway segments using COM-Poisson showed that bicycle-vehicle crash frequencies were reduced along curved and downgrade/upgrade stretches and when having heavy traffic flow (along U2U segments). For urban signalized (USG) intersections, the absence of right-turn lanes on minor roads, the presence of bus stops, and the increase in the major road annual average daily traffic (AADT) were significant factors contributing to the increase in the number of bicycle-vehicle crashes. However, the presence of divided medians on major approaches was found to reduce bicycle-vehicle crashes at USG and UST intersections. MARS outperformed the corresponding COM-Poisson models for all five facilities based on mean absolute deviance (MAD), mean square prediction error (MSPE), and generalized R-square. MARS is recommended as a promising technique for effectively predicting bicycle-vehicle crashes on segments and intersections.}

We do not find empirical evidence that videos with technical content (European school) change overconfidence. Since several works point to a strong association between overconfidence and road safety, our study can support the conduit of driving safety measures by identifying efficient ways of reducing drivers’ overconfidence.

Three driving simulator experiment scenarios were developed to simulate the typical traffic and weather conditions on the rural Interstate 80 (I-80) in Wyoming. A total of 25 professional drivers from the WYDOT and trucking industry were recruited to participate in the driving simulator experiment. Participants’ instantaneous speeds at various locations were collected to reveal the effects of CV TIMs on their speed selection. The results showed that average speed profiles under CV scenarios were generally lower than under baseline scenarios, particularly for winter conditions (snowy and severe weather). The variance of speed under CV scenarios was found to be significantly lower than the baseline scenarios, indicating that CV TIMs have the potential to harmonize the variations in speed. In addition, for the work zone driving simulator experiment, this research revealed that the mean time-to-collision (TTC) under baseline scenario is approximately 40 % lower than CV scenario, and the mean deceleration to avoid a crash (DRAC) under baseline scenario is approximately 19.3 % higher than CV scenario. These findings suggest that CV TIMs can reduce the risk of crashes. Research findings would provide the WYDOT with early insights into the effectiveness of CV TIMs, which could assist with developing more efficient transportation management strategies under adverse weather conditions.}

This calibrated variable, which is fitted with regression-based and machine learning models, is compared with the widely-used Delta-V predictor. A multivariate ordered logistic regression with multiple classes is then estimated. The results align with the observation that heavy vehicles are more likely to have inherent protection and rigid structures, especially in the side direction, and so suffer less impact.}

In this study, this issue is addressed by investigating how neck injuries are influenced by the cab workspace dimensions. The driver-console-seat dynamic models are developed to quantify the neck injuries. The three-pivot head-neck-upper torso model is used to evaluate the relative rotation angle between head and upper torso (β+γ). The injury mechanism with the larger (β+γ) value results in more severe neck injuries. The decision tree model is established to explore the most important cab workspace dimensional parameter. The driver submarining posture (the driver exhibits the tendency of sliding down from the seat after contacting the console) generates more (β+γ) value than the flipping over behavior (the driver contacts the console and the upper body continues to move over the top of the console). Four neck injury mechanisms are classified, in which the chest-first impact mechanisms are more dangerous than the knee-first impact mechanisms. The distance between the console edge and knee bolster has the greatest effect on the neck injury. This parameter determines the injury mechanism type as it influences the first contact region of the driver. The distance between the console and seat and the pedal height are the secondary dominant attributes. These three parameters should be considered preferentially for establishing driver protection measures.}

This study firstly aimed to describe bicyclists’ return to cycling after a hospitalisation crash. Secondly, it aimed to determine factors associated with reduced cycling post-crash. A study of 83 cyclists hospitalised due to an on-road crash was undertaken in Perth, Western Australia. Participants completed a questionnaire shortly following the crash and were followed up approximately 12 months after the crash. Injury information was obtained from the WA State Trauma Registry. A binary logistic regression model was used to examine factors associated with ‘reduced cycling exposure’ at follow-up. Sixty percent of participants had ‘reduced cycling exposure’ and 40% had ‘no reduction in cycling exposure’ at follow up. Twenty-two percent of participants had not cycled at all since the crash. Despite 46% reporting fear of crashing/ lack of confidence as a reason for ‘reduced cycling exposure’, only 7% of all participants had received any counselling. After controlling for confounding factors, those who participated in group riding before the crash (OR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.08-0.66, p = 0.006) and those who had a ‘complete functional recovery’ (OR: 0.15, 95% CI: 0.04-0.64, p = 0.011), had lower odds of ‘reduced cycling exposure’ at follow-up. In addition, those who were not employed full time at baseline had higher odds of ‘reduced cycling exposure’ at follow up (OR: 3.72, 95% CI: 1.22-11.33, p = 0.021). Provision of psychological services following a bicycle crash may be an important intervention for improving levels of fear and confidence surrounding cycling and assisting cyclists in returning to their pre-crash level of participation. In addition, interventions promoting return to cycling, should be targeted towards non-group riders who cycle for either commuting or recreational purposes.}

Previous studies have separately analyzed crash severity in terms of monetary cost, injuries and loss of lives, and the size of crashes in terms of the number of vehicles involved. However, as both outcome variables are correlated, it is imperative to perform a combined analysis using an appropriate econometric model to achieve a better model fit. This study contributes to the literature by jointly exploring the factors influencing the severity and size of express bus-involved crashes that occur on expressways and characterizes the dependence between both outcome variables by employing a more plausible copula regression framework. Likelihood ratio tests were also conducted to investigate the temporal stability of the factors that affect both crash severity and size. Based on the goodness-of-fit statistics, the Frank copula model proved superior to the independent ordered probit model. The estimate of the underlying dependence between the outcome variables provided a better comprehension of the correlation between them. Temporal instability was detected for the individual parameters in the models and is attributed to the changing driving behavior due to the heightened road safety campaigns. The results suggest that traffic exposure measures are significantly associated with a higher propensity of observing increased bus crash severity and size. Insights into the factors influencing the size and severity of express bus crashes are discussed, and appropriate engineering, enforcement, and education-related countermeasures are proposed.}

This work extended previous studies by using a more precise method for distinguishing between RTCs in daylight and after dark, thus avoiding the ambiguity of twilight. Data for four-wheel motor vehicle (FWMV) RTCs were also investigated to provide a datum. As expected, the risk of an RTC occurring was significantly higher after dark compared to daylight for both motorcycles and FWMVs. Investigation of contextual factors suggests that risk after dark is significantly higher for motorcycles compared to FWMVs for RTCs with two-vehicles, on roads with low speed limits (≤30 mph), at T-junctions, and junctions controlled by a give way sign. These are the situations where visual aids for increasing conspicuity after dark have the greater potential for reducing motorcycle RTCs.}

abstract = {Driving a vehicle requires individuals’ awareness of their surroundings to prevent collisions with other vehicles, objects, and pedestrians. While previous research has investigated time-to-arrival (TTA) in real-world and simulated driving situations, there is little information on how pedestrian reflectance and time of day impact TTA. The present study investigated how vehicle velocity, viewing time, pedestrian reflectance, and time of day affected individuals’ estimates of TTA. We used recorded driver-perspective footage of a vehicle approaching simulated pedestrians at different velocities during daytime and nighttime. We found that TTA was consistently underestimated, with the most accurate TTA estimates occurring at the lowest vehicle velocity. We also found TTA accuracy was better during daytime conditions. Pedestrian reflectance did not produce a significant main effect, but it did interact significantly with both velocity and time of day. These results suggest that multiple variables are responsible for TTA estimation. A better understanding of what factors may affect TTA estimates helps both researchers who investigate the phenomenon and laypersons who strive for safe driving practices.}

The present study investigates this adverse behavioral adaptation in adaptive Forward Collision Warning (FCW) systems. Other than conventional FCW systems that provide warnings based on static Time-To-Collision (TTC) thresholds, adaptive FCW systems consider the driver’s need for support by adjusting warning thresholds according to distraction. A neglected question is how drivers adapt their behavior when they use adaptive FCW systems under realistic conditions, i.e., when warnings occur infrequently but system functionality is anticipated. Forty-eight participants drove with two different FCW systems (adaptive vs. non-adaptive) while working on a secondary in-vehicle task in a driving simulator. During the main part of the experiment, no brake events occurred and hence FCW functioning was largely anticipated. Additionally, visual system feedback about the driver’s distraction state was manipulated between groups. Participants had significantly shorter minimal time-headways and TTCs when driving with the adaptive relative to the non-adaptive system. Participants with system feedback about distraction state spent generally more time with engaging in the secondary task. These results indicate behavioral adaptation which, however, is restricted to the task that is specifically supported by the system, namely longitudinal control.}

Previous studies show that profound understanding of human drivers’ capability to interpret and anticipate traffic situations is required in order to provide similar capacities for automated driving technologies. There is currently not enough a priori understanding of these anticipatory capacities for safe driving applicable to any given driving situation. To enable the development of safer, more economical, and more comfortable automated driving experience, expert drivers’ anticipations and related uncertainties were studied on public roads. First, driving instructors’ expertise in anticipating traffic situations was validated with a hazard prediction test. Then, selected driving instructors drove in real traffic while thinking aloud anticipations of unfolding events. The results indicate sources of uncertainty and related adaptive and social behaviors in specific traffic situations and environments. In addition, the applicability of these anticipatory capabilities to current automated driving technology is discussed. The presented method and results can be utilized to enhance automated driving technologies by indicating their potential limitations and may enable improved situation awareness for automated vehicles. Furthermore, the produced data can be utilized for recognizing such upcoming situations, in which the human should take over the vehicle, to enable timely take-over requests.}

However, due to the signing of the peace agreement and the growing number of fatalities in road crashes, it is possible that soon traffic fatalities will be the primary cause of violent deaths in the country, particularly in urban areas. This study is an exploratory analysis focused on identifying the main factors associated with the severity of traffic crashes in urban areas, using Cartagena as a case study. We analyzed three levels of crash severity, namely fatal, injury, and property-damage-only, considering factors in several different dimensions: victim, vehicle, road infrastructure, traffic and control, day and time, and environmental factors. A modeling approach based on multinomial ordered discrete models was used to properly identify the main factors associated with the severity levels. We found that the probability of fatal accidents is higher on streets with speed limits over 40 km/h, and that males and people aged 60 years or older are the victims with the most significant risk of fatal crashes. Motorcycles were also identified as vehicles with the highest probability of fatal crashes in the city. We showed that the probability of fatal crashes occurring is higher on streets where pedestrian bridges, traffic lights, and crosswalks are present. These findings are worthy because, in Colombia and other developing countries, the authorities normally expect to reduce the probability of fatal accidents through investments in pedestrian bridges, signaling devices, and crosswalk markings. However, according to our results, it possibly will not occur unless further countermeasures are taken. Based on these findings, reducing speed limits, operational improvements at signalized intersections, zero tolerance for traffic violations related to pedestrians, an awareness campaign on pedestrian safety focused on males and people aged 60 or older, and improving motorcycle safety are the countermeasures we proposed. Furthermore, as the authorities make significant efforts to investing in pedestrian bridges, we propose a further investigation into the traffic crashes in streets where there is this infrastructure since more severe events occur near them.}

Along these lines, cognitive issues like inattentiveness can further increase the chances of crash involvement. Despite its prevalence and importance, little is known about how the duration of these distractions is associated with critical events, such as crashes or near-crashes. With new sensors and increasing computational resources, it is possible to monitor drivers, vehicle performance, and roadway features to extract useful information, e.g., eyes off the road, indicating distraction and inattention. Using high-resolution microscopic SHRP2 naturalistic driving data, this study conducts in-depth analysis of both impairments and distractions. The data has more than 2 million seconds of observations in 7394 baselines (no event), 1228 near-crashes, and 617 crashes. The event data was processed and linked with driver behavior and roadway factors. The intervals of distracted driving during the period of observation (15 seconds) were extracted; next, rigorous fixed and random parameter logistic regression models of crash/near-crash risk were estimated. The results reveal that alcohol and drug impairment is associated with a substantial increase in crash/near-crash event involvement of 34%, and the highest correlations with crash risk include duration of distraction through dialing on a cellphone, texting while driving, and reaching for an object. Using detailed pre-crash data from instrumented vehicles, the study contributes by quantifying crash risk vis-à-vis detailed driving impairment and information on secondary task involvement, and discusses the implications of the results.}

The effect of mandated societal lockdown to reduce the transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on road traffic accidents is not known. For this reason, we performed an in-depth analysis using data from Statewide Traffic Accident Records System.
Materials and methods
We reviewed data on total 2292 road traffic accident records in Missouri from January 1, 2020 through May 15, 2020. We treated March 23 as the first day of mandated societal lockdown and May 3 as the first day of re-opening.
Results
We have found that there was a significant reduction in road traffic accidents resulting in minor or no injuries (mean 14.5 versus 10.8, p < 0.0001) but not in accidents resulting in serious or fatal injuries (mean 3.4 versus 3.7, p = 0.42) after mandated societal lockdown. Furthermore, there was a significant reduction in road traffic accidents resulting in minor or no injuries after the mandated social lockdown (parameter estimate -5.9, p = 0.0028) in the time series analysis. There was an increase in road traffic accidents resulting in minor or no injuries after expiration of mandatory societal lockdown (mean 10.8 versus 13.7, p = 0.04).
Conclusion
The mandated societal lockdown policies led to reduction in road traffic accidents resulting in non-serious or no injuries but not those resulting in serious or fatal injuries.}

However, road infrastructure must be ready to host them. The technologies of these driving automation systems require certain road conditions that are not always fulfilled, causing the systems to fail. These failures generally transfer negotiation control to drivers, which may induce a crash if they were not aware of road and traffic conditions. This research analyses how ready the road horizontal alignment is for existing semi-autonomous systems. A Level 2 vehicle has been tested on many different horizontal curves, finding a strong relationship between the maximum speed that the autonomous system can attain and the curve geometry. This maximum speed is proposed as a new concept (automated speed) and has been found to be lower than the design, operating and posted speeds in many cases. Another new concept – automated driving consistency – arises, as the difference between automated and operating speeds. The related inconsistencies can be addressed with the new concept of Level of Service for Automated Driving (LOSAD), which summarizes how ready a corridor is for a certain driving automation system. This parameter should be determined – further certified – for any homogeneous road segment, and later informed to drivers.}

abstract = {Rear-end crashes are closely related to car-following situation of vehicles. Speeding and insufficient headway are the major reasons as the drivers have not enough time to react to a sudden brake from the leading vehicle. Perceptual countermeasures, like speed reduction markings, are widely used in practice for accident prevention, and are verified with substantial effectiveness. However, compared with its practical application, the perceptual countermeasures are rarely analyzed in depth from the perspective of drivers’ visual perception where the meaning of “perceptual” actually dwells. In addition, its effect on drivers’ headway (distance) choice is almost ignored in previous research. Given this, the present study explored the effects of a certain type of perceptual treatment, i.e., the peripheral transverse line markings (PTLMs), on drivers’ choice of speed and headway (distance) in car-following by a series of on-road experiments. In the on-road experiments, temporary line markings were installed on a real-world freeway in China to shape the PTLMs. The intersection angle (α) and the longitudinal spacing (λ) of the PTLMs were manipulated to attempt to associate the line markings with drivers’ visual perception. Results of general and sectional relative differences of time headway (ηh, θh), speed (ηv, θv), and distance (ηd, θd) suggests that 1) the speed was reduced, the distance and time headway were increased significantly after the installation of PTLMs when compared with the original condition; 2) a larger intersection angle (α) and a smaller longitudinal spacing (λ) of PTLMs could lead to a greater variations in speed and headway (distance); in particular, the PTLMs in a form of α=150°, λ=2m resulted in 0.44 s increase in time headway, 1.33 m/s reduction in speed, and 4.07 m increase in distance in maximum; 3) the real-time crash risk variations under the influence of PTLMs were evaluated by two modified and extended surrogate safety indicators. The effects of PTLMs were discussed and explained considering the influences of optical illusion on lane width narrowing, edge rate on speed and “discontinuity effect” on distance, respectively. The findings of this study provide theoretical support for the perceptual countermeasures and suggest comparative advantages of PTLMs in dealing with rear-end crashes by intervening drivers’ speed and headway choice.}

This research extends upon scant previous research by including three key classical deterrence variables (i.e., the perceived certainty of apprehension and the perceived severity and swiftness of punishment), as well as Homel’s (1988) extra-legal deterrence-related variables of the fear of physical loss, material loss and social sanctions. A longitudinal survey design was utilised over a three month-time period (N = 200, Mage = 20.38 years, 71 males) that examined the stability of the deterrence-related variables for three road rule violations, consisting of 1) exceeding the speed limit by more than 10 km/hr, 2) reading a message on a phone while driving and 3) using the social media platform of Snapchat while driving. Overall, fluctuations were found in all the deterrence-related variables (both legal and extra-legal sanctions), with the largest difference being for the perceptions of the certainty of apprehension. Consequently, it can be suggested that: (a) longitudinal surveys are more reliable when measuring the impact of deterrence perceptions on engagement in offending behaviour and (b) the problem of causal ordering regarding utilising cross-sectional surveys is further illuminated. The results suggest that deterrence is a dynamic process, constantly changing based upon individual experiences, which reinforces the need for continued enforcement efforts (both legal and non-legal), within the road safety arena to maximise rule compliance.}

However, the driver behaviour models that these systems use may not be optimal in terms of driver acceptance. Incorporating explicit estimates of driver discomfort might improve acceptance. This study quantified the degree of discomfort experienced by drivers when cyclists crossed their travel path. Participants were instructed to drive through an intersection in a fixed-base simulator or on a test track, following the same experimental protocol. During the experiments, three variables were controlled: 1) the car speed (30, 50 km/h), 2) the bicycle speed (10, 20 km/h), and 3) the bicycle-car encroachment sequence (bicycle clears the intersection first, potential 50 %-overlap crash, and car clears the intersection first). For each trial, a covariate, the car’s time-to-arrival at the intersection when the bicycle appears (TTAvis), was calculated. After each trial, the participants were asked to report their experienced discomfort on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from no discomfort (1) to maximum discomfort (7). The effect of the three controlled variables and the effect of TTAvis on drivers’ discomfort were estimated using cumulative link mixed models (CLMM). Across both experimental environments, the controlled variables were shown to significantly influence discomfort. TTAvis was shown to have a significant effect on discomfort as well; the closer to zero TTAvis was (i.e., the more critical the situation), the more likely the driver reported great discomfort. The prediction accuracies of the CLMM with all three controlled variables and the CLMM with TTAvis were similar, with an average accuracy between 40 and 50 % for the exact discomfort level and between 80 and 85 % allowing deviations by one step. Our model quantifies driver discomfort. Such model may be included in the decision-making algorithms of active safety systems to improve driver acceptance. In fact, by tuning system activation times depending on the expected level of discomfort that a driver would experience in such situation, a system is not likely to annoy a driver.}

As both estimation and prediction would greatly improve if the missing values were recovered, this study proposes a sequential approach to handle incomplete crash datasets and rank contributors to the injury severity of crashes on mountainous freeways in China. The sequential approach consists of two parts: (i) multivariate imputation by chained equations imputes the missing values of independent variables; (ii) a random forest classifier analyses the correlation between the dependent and the independent variables. The first part considers different imputation methods in light of the independent variables being either binary, categorical or continuous, whereas the second part classifies the correlations according to the random forest classifier. The proposed method was applied to the case-study about mountainous freeways in China and compared to the analysis of the raw dataset to evaluate its effectiveness, and the results illustrate that the method improves significantly the classification accuracy when compared with existing methods. Moreover, the classifier ranked the contributors to the injury severity of traffic crashes on mountainous freeways: in order of importance vehicle type, crash type, road longitudinal gradient, crash cause, curve radius, and deflection angles. Interestingly, a lower importance was found for environmental factors.}

Previous measures of cyclist aggression have not taken into consideration who the recipient of the aggression may be; this is likely to differ across road user types. The aim of this study was to understand if cyclists’ aggression differs according to whether the recipient is a driver, pedestrian or another cyclist. To examine this, 1206 cyclists (males = 75 %; age range 18–80 years; M = 47.35 ± 11.81) completed the Cycling Anger Expression Inventory (CAX; Møller and Haustein, 2017) three times; once for each road user type. Respondents also provided information regarding their cycling anger tendencies. Open text responses regarding sources of, and responses to, anger were also sought. The measurement invariance of the three CAX models was examined to determine whether the items were interpreted in a similar manner for interactions with each road user type and to compare latent factor means. The results showed that verbal aggression was not the same across road users. However, adaptive constructive ways of dealing with anger were similar across the three types of recipients. Comparison of latent means showed that cyclists reported higher expressions of anger toward drivers than cyclists or pedestrians. Qualitative analysis of the text responses suggest this is due to the perceived risk posed by drivers combined with positive attitudes expressed towards sharing infrastructure with pedestrians and other cyclists. Based on these findings it was concluded that: i) the CAX might best be used with reference to drivers, rather than “road users”, and ii) while aggression in cyclists is rare, it is more common toward drivers than other road users.}

This study investigates the influence of camera monitoring on Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) drivers’ risky behaviours. We also assess whether monitoring affects individual driving events further when coupled with safe driving practices coaching. We evaluate the outcome of those practices on three telematics incidents heavily reliant on driving errors and violations, i.e., the number of vehicle harsh braking, harsh cornering and over speeding incidents. The objective is to understand how frequently individual incidents caused by risky driving behaviour occur (a) without camera monitoring and without any coaching; (b) after camera installation; and (c) after camera installation and coaching. We investigate two commercial HGV companies (Company 1 and Company 2) with 263 and 269 vehicles, respectively, over a 16 months period, from which the first 8 months contain data collected before the installation of cameras (baseline) and the rest of the dataset contains incident counts after the installation of cameras (intervention). Company 1 provides coaching during the intervention phase while Company 2 does not offer coaching. Our analysis considers the baseline and the intervention phases during the same seasons to eliminate any possible bias due to the influence of weather on driving behaviour. Results show an overall significant reduction in the mean frequency of harsh braking incidents from baseline to intervention by 16.82% in Company 1 and 4.62% in Company 2, and a significant reduction in the mean frequency of over speeding incidents from baseline to intervention by 34.29% in Company 1 and 28.13% in Company 2. Furthermore, the effect of coaching has a significant difference in reducing the frequency of harsh braking (p = .011) and harsh cornering (p < .001) compared to just camera monitoring. These results suggest that coaching interventions are more effective in reducing driving errors while monitoring reduces both driving errors and violations.}

We also examined putative cortical mechanisms underpinning any effect of perceptual training on performance. To address these objectives, we used the gaze-contingent display paradigm to selectively present information to central and peripheral parts of the visual field. In Experiment 1, we compared hazard perception abilities of experienced and inexperienced drivers while watching video clips in three different viewing conditions (full vision; clear central and blurred peripheral vision; blurred central and clear peripheral vision). Participants’ visual search behaviour and cortical activity were simultaneously recorded. In Experiment 2, we determined whether training with clear central and blurred peripheral vision could improve hazard perception among non-licensed drivers. Results demonstrated that (i) information from central vision is more important than information from peripheral vision in identifying hazard situations, for screen-based hazard perception tests, (ii) clear central and blurred peripheral vision viewing helps the alignment of line-of-gaze and attention, (iii) training with clear central and blurred peripheral vision can improve screen-based hazard perception. The findings have important implications for road safety and provide a new training paradigm to improve hazard perception.}

abstract = {Adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) is a promising technique to improve the efficiency of signalized intersections, especially in the era of connected vehicles (CVs) when real-time information on vehicle positions and trajectories is available. Numerous ATSC algorithms have been proposed to accommodate real-time traffic conditions and optimize traffic efficiency. The common objective of these algorithms is to minimize total delay, decrease queue length, or maximize vehicle throughput. Despite their positive impacts on traffic mobility, the existing ATSC algorithms do not consider optimizing traffic safety. This is most likely due to the lack of tools to evaluate safety in real time. However, recent research has developed various real-time safety models for signalized intersections. These models can be used to evaluate safety in real time using dynamic traffic parameters, such as traffic volume, shock wave characteristics, and platoon ratio. Evaluating safety in real time can enable developing ATSC strategies for real-time safety optimization. In this paper, we present a novel self-learning ATSC algorithm to optimize the safety of signalized intersections. The algorithm was developed using the Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach and was trained using the simulation platform VISSIM. The trained algorithm was then validated using real-world traffic data obtained from two signalized intersections in the city of Surrey, British Columbia. Compared to the traditional actuated signal control system, the proposed algorithm reduces traffic conflicts by approximately 40 %. Moreover, the proposed ATSC algorithm was tested under various market penetration rates (MPRs) of CVs. The results showed that 90 % and 50 % of the algorithm’s safety benefits can be achieved at MPR values of 50 % and 30 %, respectively. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first self-learning ATSC algorithm that optimizes traffic safety in real time.}

abstract = {Background
No economic evaluations exist of free or subsidized ridesharing services designed to reduce impaired driving.
Objectives
To evaluate the effects and economics of a 17-weekend program that provided rideshare coupons good for free one-way or round trips to/from the hospitality zones in Columbus, Ohio, coupled with a modest increase in enforcement and a media campaign that used messaging about enforcement to promote usage.
Methods
Web surveys of riders and intercept surveys of foot traffic in the hospitality zones yielded data on the reduction in driving after drinking and the change in alcohol consumption associated with coupon use. We estimated crash changes from trip data using national studies, then confirmed with an ARIMA analysis of monthly police crash reports. Costs and output data came from program and rideshare company records.
Results
70.8% of 19,649 responding coupon redeemers said coupon use reduced the chance they would drive after drinking. An estimated 1 in 4,310 drink-driving trips results in an alcohol-attributable crash, so the coupons prevented an estimated 3.2 crashes. Consistent with that minimal change, the ARIMA analysis did not detect a drunk-driving crash reduction. Self-reports indicated alcohol consumption rose by an average of 0.4 drinks per coupon redeemer, possibly with an equal rise among people who rode with the redeemer. The program cost almost $650,000 and saved an estimated 1.8 years of healthy life. Across a range of discount rates and values for a year of healthy life, it cost $366,000 to $791,000 per year of healthy life saved. Its estimated benefit-cost ratio was between 0.31 and 0.59, meaning it cost far more than it saved.
Conclusions
Ridesharing, coupled with a media campaign and increased enforcement, was not a cost-effective drunk-driving intervention. Although it reduced drink-driving crashes and saved years of healthy life, those savings were modest and expensive. Moreover, the self-reported increase in participant drinking imposed countervailing risks. Even sensitivity analyses that potentially overestimate the benefits and underestimate the costs indicate a significant imbalance between program costs and savings. Any funding devoted to ridesharing would divert scarce resources from interventions with benefit-cost ratios above 1. Thus, our evaluation suggests that governments should not devote energy or resources to ridesharing programs if their primary objective is to reduce drink-driving or harmful alcohol use.}

It is expected that after full deployment of CV technology, the pilot will improve safety and mobility under adverse weather conditions by creating new ways to communicate road and travel information to both drivers and fleet managers. In this regard, this research employed an integrated microsimulation modeling approach to assess the safety performance of the WYDOT CV Pilot. A 23-mile representative I-80 corridor was selected for developing the microsimulation models. Traffic flow and driving behavior data under winter snowy weather condition were collected to calibrate the baseline microsimulation model. A driving simulator experiment was conducted to quantitatively investigate the impacts of CV technology on driving behavior; accordingly, the driving behavior data under CV environment were employed to properly update the calibrated CV microsimulation models. The safety effectiveness of the WYDOT CV Pilot were assessed for various demand levels and CV penetration rates. It was concluded that WYDOT CV applications increased drivers’ situation awareness under adverse weather conditions, and thus reduced the crash risk. The reductions in conflicts displayed a decreasing trend with the increase of CV penetration rates, but the reduction was not significant when CV penetration was lower than 10 percent. The maximum reduction in conflicts was 85 percent when all trucks were equipped with CV technology.}

The two main advantages of the proposed AID system are: (i) the use of Bluetooth sensors offers several practical advantages over inductive loop detectors (ILD), which is one of the preferred sensing technology for traffic flow; and (ii) the unsupervised anomaly detection approach builds a model without the need of incident information. A common problem when designing an AID system is that incident information, i.e., ground-truth data, with enough accuracy is seldom available. Isolation forest is the unsupervised anomaly detection approach adopted in this work. This method is based on characterizing anomalous traffic conditions by exploiting the fact that anomalies tend to be isolated. The most remarkable feature of this anomaly detection method is its high detection performance while having a very simple tuning procedure and an extremely low computational demand. Finally, the effectiveness of the presented AID method is demonstrated using real traffic data collected by a network of Bluetooth sensors installed in Ayalon Highway, Tel Aviv.}

Health economic evaluation studies (e.g., cost-effectiveness analysis) can provide insight into which injury prevention interventions maximize available resources to improve health outcomes. A previous systematic review summarized 48 unintentional injury prevention economic evaluations published during 1998–2009, providing a valuable overview of that evidence for researchers and decisionmakers. The aim of this study was to summarize the content and quality of recent (2010–2019) economic evaluations of unintentional injury prevention interventions and compare to the previous publication period (1998–2009).
Methods
Peer-reviewed English-language journal articles describing public health unintentional injury prevention economic evaluations published January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2019 were identified using index terms in multiple databases. Injury causes, interventions, study methods, and results were summarized. Reporting on key methods elements (e.g., economic perspective, time horizon, discounting, currency year, etc.) was assessed. Reporting quality was compared between the recent and previous publication periods.
Results
Sixty-eight recent economic evaluation studies were assessed. Consistent with the systematic review on this topic for the previous publication period, falls and motor vehicle traffic injury prevention were the most common study subjects. Just half of studies from the recent publication period reported all key methods elements, although this represents an improvement compared to the previous publication period (25 %).
Conclusion
Most economic evaluations of unintentional injury prevention interventions address just two injury causes. Better adherence to health economic evaluation reporting standards may enhance comparability across studies and increase the likelihood that this type of evidence is included in decision-making related to unintentional injury prevention.}

As a result, multi-board guide signs have been increasingly set up on expressways. The main aim of this study was to analyze the effect of the directional road sign displayed on multi and single-board signs on driver mental workload and behavior. 32 participants including 16 females (mean age = 24.7 years, standard deviation = 1.9 years) participated in the experiment and completed 3 driving simulation scenes. The setting of each scene-sign board was different: 1 board, 2 boards, and 3 boards. The driver needed to reach the designated destination according to the guidance of the road signs. Eye tracker was used to measure the fixation, saccade and electroencephalogram (EEG) was used to measure the alpha (8−13 hz) band absolute power in different signage scenarios. There are two major findings of the study. First, when the number of place names is less than or equal to 7, the multi-board sign generates more mental workload than the single-board sign does. The alpha band power of the driver's frontal area under the multiple boards is lower and affects driving performance (the deceleration is greater). Second, when the number of place names is more than 7, there is no significant difference in the effect on mental workload whether multi or single-board sign is used. However, compared to the single-board sign, drivers in the case of multi-board sign are likely to reduce the fixation duration and increase the number of saccades. The results suggest that it is not necessary to use multi-board signs when the number of place names is less than 7. These findings provide more safety considerations for the setting of multi-board guide signs in the future.}

The result indicates that tourists’ unsafe driving behaviors have different characteristics from unsafe driving behaviors in daily travel, with a higher frequency of behaviors related to environment, carelessness and fatigue driving. The main cause of these behaviors is drivers’ attitude rather than skill and personal attribute. When drivers reported themselves good at staying focused, behaviors subject to “Carelessness” were found to increase as there is a more approving attitude towards careless driving among those drivers.}

The environmental attributes were measured at eye-level using scene segmentation and object detection algorithms, and they were classified as one of four intersection typologies using the k-means clustering method. Data on perceived crash risk were collected from a questionnaire conducted on 799 children 10 to 12 years old. Our results showed that environmental features derived from deep learning algorithms were significantly associated with perceived crash risk among school-aged children. The results have revealed that some of the intersection characteristics including the proportional area of sky and roadway were significantly associated with the perceived crash risk among school-aged children. In particular, road width had dominant influence on risk perception. The findings provide information useful to providing appropriate and proactive interventions that may reduce the risk of crashes at intersections.}

Consequently, DUI violators’ involvement in severe crashes is high. Motivated by the spatial and temporal nature of traffic crashes, this study introduces an integrated spatio-temporal approach to analyzing highway safety data. Specifically, this study estimates Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression (GTWR) models to understand the consequences of DUI in crashes. GTWR can theoretically outperform traditional regression methods by accounting for unobserved heterogeneity that may be related to the location and time of a crash. Using Southeast Michigan crash data, this study finds that DUI is associated with a 25% higher likelihood of injury in a crash. The association between injury severity and DUI varies significantly across space and time. From the spatial aspect, DUI crashes in rural or small-town areas are more likely to cause injuries than urban crashes. From the temporal aspect, different times are associated with varying relationships between injury severity and DUI. If focusing on DUI crashes in late nights and early mornings, on Fridays, the entire northeast part from Clinton Charter Township to Port Huron is associated with severer injuries than other regions including Detroit’s urban area and its south. On Mondays, the DUI crashes in the northwest are also more likely to cause severe injuries. The methodology introduced in this study takes advantage of modern computational tools and localized crash/inventory data. This method offers researchers and practitioners an opportunity to understand highway safety outcomes in great spatial and temporal details and customize safety countermeasures for specific locations and times such as saturation patrols.}

abstract = {The distance at which drivers follow other vehicles has been found to be linked to crash risk. Tailgating (i.e. driving at an unsafe following distance) is both endemic and a leading cause of rear-end crashes. Similarly, drivers’ decisions about when to merge with a stream of traffic are likely to influence crash risk. Consistent with this, it has been shown that crashes are more common at intersections where drivers more frequently have to slow for vehicles pulling out into insufficient gaps. Therefore, the development of reliable and valid measures of both of these driving behaviours would facilitate further crash prevention research. Given the problems associated with assessing these behaviours during real driving, we developed new video-based measures. In our new following distance measure, participants view videos shot from the perspective of a driver who is following another vehicle at a range of distances across a variety of traffic environments. On each trial, participants report their own minimum comfortable following distance relative to the following distance depicted in the video. In our new test of gap acceptance behaviour, participants view a series of video clips and indicate when they would pull out into the approaching stream of traffic shown in each clip. The two new measures each yielded reliable data, and we found that young drivers made riskier choices than older drivers for both following distance and gap acceptance. These age-related differences are consistent with those found in observational studies of real driving, supporting the proposal that the new tests could potentially be used as proxies for these crash-related driving behaviours in both lab-based research and large-scale online studies.}

The application of an eco-safe driving system is feasible with the support of vehicle-to-vehicle/infrastructure technologies. To guarantee system usability and safety appropriateness, a key precondition is to ensure that driver mental workload and visual demands required for using the system are reasonable. This study explored how drivers’ mental workload and visual demands were affected when driving with an eco-safe driving HMI (human-machine-interface). Four in-vehicle eco-safe HMI information conditions were evaluated, including baseline, advice only, feedback only, and advice \& feedback. Two traffic scenarios (stop-sign intersection with traffic vs. stop-sign intersection without traffic) were simulated using an advanced driving simulator. Behavioural variables (e.g. brake force, acceleration), visual variables (e.g. blink metrics, pupil size) and subjective workload scores were collected from 36 licensed Australian drivers. The experiment results showed that the HMI prompted drivers to apply a smooth and stable brake force when they approached the intersection and a smooth acceleration when they left the intersection. Drivers’ mental workload indicated by visual measurements were consistent with their subjective reported workload levels. Drivers had a higher mental workload when they received and processed additional eco-safe information in the advice \& feedback condition. An increase in mental workload induced by the in-vehicle cognitive task initiated more blink activities while the increase in visual demand caused by a complex road situation led to blink inhibition. The study shows the HMI could significantly promote eco-safe driving behaivours without causing excessive mental and visual workload of drivers.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a reliability-based framework to address the risk associated with limitations in the Available Sight Distance (ASD) on curved highway segments considering a three-dimensional (3D) sight distance computation approach. To facilitate this assessment, the ASD on horizontal curves was evaluated and an accurate inventory of curve attribute information was generated using LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data in an automated and efficient manner. These datasets were then used to estimate the risk (probability of noncompliance, Pnc) associated with sight distance insufficiencies. Full Bayes multivariate Poisson log-normal safety performance functions were developed to relate the Pnc to the expected number of collisions. The results show that there was a statistically significant relationship between Pnc and collision frequency. There was also a significant correlation of 0.444 to 0.452 across collision severity levels indicating that curves with high Property-Damage-Only (PDO) collisions could be associated with higher injury and fatal (I + F) collisions. It was also found that Pnc had a greater impact on increasing PDO collisions than I + F collisions, suggesting that collisions associated with insufficient sight distance are likely to be less severe. The results of this analysis are expected to improve our understanding of the risks associated with deviations from design guidelines and quantitatively assess the safety margins due to these variations. The framework presented in this paper can be used to compare different design alternatives and investigate the influence of design deficiencies on collision occurrence across various severity levels.}

abstract = {Music can influence car following performance. However, it is not well resolved about its mediation effect on car following when the drivers’ personalities are considered. We investigated how music style and tempo influence car following with different personalities. Twelve tracks were used in this study, four for each music tempo range, i.e., slow, medium, and fast tempo, and six for each music style, i.e., classical and pop one. The results showed introverts were more susceptible to music, and tend to listen to slow tempo music and classical one. In addition, pop music aroused the drivers more than classical and may induce closer headway distance. Furthermore, with the tempo speeding up, the drivers were more excited, less concentrated and performed less stablely. The medium music tempo was the most appropriate choice for keeping stable headway distance and taking actions to the changes of the leading vehicle. The present study shows personality can mediate the influence of music listening while driving, and music style and tempo can impact the mediation in a specific way. The study provides a guide on the music choice during driving and may bring benefits to the configuration of the music radio program and car music player.}

abstract = {Road accidents are one of the leading causes of death and injuries among adolescents and young adults. Road safety education programs aim to promote safe traffic behavior through information, skills training or fear appeals. During the last decade, an intervention type using victim testimonials has been developed. These types of programs aim to promote road safety by connecting a personal narrative of choices and consequences to the beliefs and behaviors of the audience. Studies on the effectiveness of this type of road safety programs among youngsters who are not yet drivers are still limited. This study used a cluster-randomized and controlled trial design to examine the effect of a Danish school-based road safety educational program using testimonials for students in lower secondary schools in Denmark on a) knowledge of risks factors in traffic and b) two types of behavior specifically relevant for the pre-driver target group: seatbelt use and safe bicycle behavior. Our analysis sample comprised 1007 students from 57 schools with a matched baseline and four-month follow-up response. Linear regression analyses suggest a small positive effect on the students’ knowledge of the three most important risk factors in traffic but not on the age group most at risk. Concerning seatbelt use or overall cycling behavior no effect was found, although a small positive effect was found on helmet use. Neither was the effectiveness modified by gender, parental educational background, or risky cycling behavior at baseline. Although classroom-based interventions using testimonials may have the potential to increase knowledge of risk factors in traffic among adolescents, translating knowledge into safe traffic behavior is challenging. More studies are needed on how to further adapt the intervention to an age group who are not yet drivers. Such research may focus on mechanisms of change including the age-specific relevance of the ambassador’s testimonial and on employing strong elements of action guidance.}

abstract = {The proliferation of Advanced Vehicle Technologies (AVTs) has generated both excitement and concern among researchers, policymakers, and the general public. An increasing number of driver assistance systems are already available in today’s automobiles; many of which are expected to become standard. Therefore, synthesizing the available evidence specific to the safety of AVTs is critical. The goal of this scoping review was to summarize this evidence with a focus on AVTs that require some driver oversight (i.e., Levels 0–3 as per the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) levels of automation taxonomy). A scoping review of research literature on AVTs was conducted for studies up to March 2018. Inclusion criteria consisted of: any study with empirical data of AVTs that included male and female drivers aged 16 years and older, healthy people (i.e., without impairments), passenger vehicles, driving simulators and/or large databases with road safety information that could be analyzed for the purpose of examining AVTs (SAE Levels 0–3), as well as measures of driving outcomes. A total of 324 peer-reviewed studies from 25 countries met the inclusion criteria for this review with over half published in the last 5 years. Data was extracted and summarized according to the following categories: measures used to evaluate the effect of AVTs on road safety (objective) and driver perceptions of the technology (subjective), testing environment, and study populations (i.e., driver age). The most commonly reported objective measures were longitudinal control (50 %), reaction time (40 %), and lateral position (23 %). The most common subjective measures were perceptions of trust (27 %), workload (20 %), and satisfaction (17 %). While most studies investigated singular AVTs (237 of 324 studies), the number of studies after 2013 that examined 2 or more AVTs concurrently increased. Studies involved drivers from different age groups (51 %) and were conducted in driving simulators (70 %). Overall, the evidence is generally in favour of AVTs having a positive effect on driving safety, although the nature and design of studies varied widely. Our examination of this evidence highlights the opportunities as well as the challenges involved with investigating AVTs. Ensuring such technologies are congruent with the needs of drivers, particularly younger and older driver age groups, who are known to have a higher crash risk, is critical. With automotive manufacturers keen to adopt the latest AVTs, this scoping review highlights how testing of this technology has been undertaken, with a focus on how new research can be conducted to improve road safety now and in the future.}

The design of advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS) aims to provide assistance in multiple stages in human information processing during driving, including environmental sensing, information processing, decision making, and vehicle controlling, in order to improve driving safety. It is expected that novice drivers may benefit more from using ADAS than adult drivers as such technologies can compensate for their frequent errors. This study examined whether and how an integrated crash warning system impacted on drivers’ following behavior, and what were the corresponding age-related differences through an analysis of two unique naturalistic driving study datasets. Significant age-related differences in car-following behavior were found. Results showed potential negative effects of ADAS on teen drivers’ following behavior that teen drivers tended to have less controlled pedal use during treatment weeks with ADAS than during baseline weeks without ADAS, while such behavior was not observed in adult drivers. All adult drivers tended to keep longer headways when driving at night than during daytime to compensate for poor vision conditions, but no such compensation behavior was observed in the teens. In addition, teen and young-adult drivers had more aggressive following behavior (with shorter mean time headway) than middle-aged and older drivers. One limitation of this study is that the findings of this study are only addressing the short-term effect of ADAS exposure, and future studies are needed to examine the longitudinal effect. The findings of this study suggest that the design of future ADAS should consider minimizing potential negative impacts on teen driver behavior.}

First, hospitalized pedestrian data was queried to identify injuries sustained by pedestrians and their frequencies. Second, with consideration for an understanding of injury mechanisms and the capability of the computational human surrogate, the whole-body was divided into 17 body regions. Then, an injury pattern database was constructed for each body region for various maximum abbreviated injury scale (MAIS) levels. Third, a two-step Monte Carlo sampling process was employed to generate N virtual pedestrians with an assigned list of injuries in AIS codes. Then, the expected values of WBIMs such as injury severity score (ISS), probability of death, whole-body functional capacity index (WBFCI), and lost years of life (LYL), were estimated. Lastly, the proposed method was verified using injury information from the inpatient pedestrian database. Also, the proposed method was applied to pedestrian impact simulations with various impact speeds to estimate the probability of death with respect to the impact speed. The probability of death from the proposed method was compared with those from epidemiological studies. The proposed method accurately estimated WBIMs such as ISS and WBFCI using either for a given distribution of injury risk or MAIS levels. The predicted probability of death with respect to the impact speed showed a good correlation with those from the epidemiological study. These results imply that if we have a human surrogate that can predict the risk of injury accurately, we can accurately estimate WBIMs using the proposed method. The proposed method can simplify a vehicle design optimization process by transforming the multi-objective optimization problem into the single-objective one. Lastly, the proposed method can be applied to other human surrogates such as occupant models.}

To achieve this objective, a driving simulator study was carried out. The effectiveness of the system was tested, and the results of the developed simulation tests, with and without AR warning to inform the driver of a pedestrian crossing ahead, were compared. Specifically, AR warnings were tested under two different situations: a visible pedestrian crossing the roadway and a non-visible pedestrian, made invisible by certain obstacles, and who is about to cross the roadway. Two different virtual warnings were tested - in both cases - on a sample of forty-six participants: a flashing red arrow above the pedestrian, and the same visual warning but with an additional audible warning system. The effects of the audible warnings were studied by comparing the driving performances (decelerations, speeds and distances) and surrogate safety measures (Time-to-Collision (TTC) and Time-to-Zebra (TTZ)) with those recorded under reference conditions (without the audible warnings). Positive effects of AR were observed. Specifically, when the AR warnings were activated, drivers started to decelerate well before the pedestrian crossing, with a low deceleration rate and high TTC and TTZ. This study confirmed the great benefits that AR and connected vehicle technologies could bring to the overall safety conditions on the road network, especially under risky situations and difficult maneuvers. The driving simulator is certainly an effective solution for studying and evaluating such technologies, as well as studying their impact on driving performance.}

abstract = {Inexperienced drivers have a higher crash risk than others, particularly at night when drivers of all ages are at increased risk, but there has been little if any research on day-night differences in drivers’ perceptions of risk and difficulty. Also, previous research on determinants of risk and difficulty ratings has focused largely on effects of vehicle speed, and researchers have identified a need to look more broadly at how ratings are affected by the complexity of depicted road-traffic situations. This study addressed those issues, using an exploratory approach entailing both quantitative and qualitative analyses. The 62 participants (28 females, 34 males) were grouped according to level of driving experience and age (16–30 years). Determinants of ratings were investigated using 6 day-night pairs of video clips at 6 different locations, plus 2 night-only clips at 2 other locations (14 clips in all). Depicted driving situations varied naturalistically in complexity as well as speed. They were presented in random orders twice to each participant, who used a slider to rate each clip continuously, once for risk and once for difficulty in balanced order. Consistent with previous evidence, there were no significant differences in ratings between participant groups. Ratings of risk and difficulty were highly correlated, as expected, but Rasch analysis confirmed that they reflected empirically different constructs. Ratings were significantly higher for night than day. They also differed significantly between locations, with vehicle speed not being their main determinant. Further, there were significant differences between locations in the relationship between risk and difficulty ratings, suggesting that participants’ interpretations of ‘risk’ and ‘difficulty’ varied between locations. Qualitative analysis of rating patterns in relation to video clip content utilised constructs drawn from information theory and research on human information processing. It was concluded that more systematic research is required to investigate effects on ratings of variables determining the amount of information drivers must process, such as numbers and types of other road users and the predictability of their actions, road types and configurations, visibility conditions, particularly day versus night – as well as effects of vehicle speed which determines the required rate of processing.}

abstract = {A hierarchical Bayesian peak over threshold (POT) approach is proposed for conflict-based before-after safety evaluation of Leading Pedestrian Intervals (LPI). The approach combines traffic conflicts of different sites and periods to develop a uniform generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) model for the treatment effect estimation. The hierarchical structure has three levels, a data level that consists of modeling the traffic conflict extremes through the POT approach, a latent process level that relates GPD parameters of the data level to certain covariates, and a prior level with prior distributions to characterize the latent process. The approach was applied to a before-after (BA) safety evaluation of leading pedestrian interval (LPI) in Vancouver, BC. Pedestrian-vehicle traffic conflicts were collected from treatment and control sites during the before and after periods using an automated computer vision analysis technique. The treatment effect was measured by the best fitted GPD model with the calculation of the odds ratio (OR). The overall treatment effect varies from 18.1%–20.9% in terms of reduction in the estimated extreme-serious conflicts. The treatment effect indicates a considerable improvement in pedestrian safety after the implementation of the LPI, and the consistent results demonstrate a reliable BA safety evaluation. As such, the proposed approach is recommended as a promising tool for BA safety studies, particularly in cases where collision data is limited.}

abstract = {Objectives
Guardrail end terminals are designed to gradually decelerate vehicles during impact and protect vehicle occupants from severe injuries. It has been observed that some in-service end terminals are damaged, and it is unclear if their safety performance is still acceptable. The objectives of this study were to examine the conditions of in-service end terminals, and to evaluate the performance of damaged relative to undamaged end terminals in simulated impacts.
Methods
Common damage patterns of guardrail end terminals were investigated by using post-crash pictures collected from the National Automotive Sampling System-Crashworthiness Data System (NASS-CDS). Conditions of in-service end terminals mounted along roads in portions of six U.S. states were examined by using a sample from the second Strategic Highway Research Program-Roadway Information Database (SHRP2-RID). Finite Element (FE) models of two minorly and three severely damaged ET-Plus systems, a commonly used energy-absorbing guardrail end terminal along U.S. roads, were developed. To evaluate the performance of the damaged ET-Plus systems, we performed impact simulations with vehicle-to-damaged ET-Plus models according to the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) 350, test conditions 3–30.
Results
Of the 1000 in-service end terminal cases we investigated, 73% were undamaged, 18% had minor damage, and 8% had major damage. Increases in the average vehicle deceleration rates, maximum vehicle yaw angles, and vehicle local deformations were observed in simulated impacts with damaged ET-Plus end terminals relative to impacts with undamaged ET-Plus end terminals. For one damaged ET-Plus, a secondary collision was observed. Overall, we found that the damaged end terminals usually increased collision severity when compared with undamaged end terminals.
Conclusions
The findings of this study point out the need for in-service performance evaluations and proper maintenance and repair practices of end terminals. The simulation models developed in this study could be further employed to investigate device performance in crash situations that are physically impractical to test and investigate the effects of site characteristics on device performance. The simulation models could also supplement crash tests to certify new hardware designs.}

abstract = {Random parameters model has been demonstrated to be an effective method to account for unobserved heterogeneity that commonly exists in highway crash data. However, the predefined single distribution for each random parameter may limit how the unobserved heterogeneity is captured. A more flexible approach is to develop a random parameters model with heterogeneity in means and variances by allowing the mean and variance of potential each random parameter to be an estimable function of explanatory variables. This burgeoning technique for modelling unobserved heterogeneity has been increasingly applied to various safety evaluation scenarios recently. However, the predictive performance of this emerging method, which determines the practicability of the model for a specific circumstance, has never been investigated as far as our knowledge. In addition, the explanatory power by including heterogeneous means and variances of random parameters need to be further investigated to confirm the potential merits of this method in crash data analysis. In this paper, a random parameters negative binomial with heterogeneity in means and variances (RPNBHMV) model, a standard random parameters negative binomial (RPNB) model and a traditional fixed parameters negative binomial (NB) model were estimated using the same dataset. The explanatory and predictive performance of the three models were thoroughly evaluated and compared. Results showed that: 1) the RPNB model fitted the data significantly better than the NB model, and the RPNBHMV model further improved the statistical fit of the RPNB model but the improvement was slight; 2) more insights into interactions of safety factors were inferred from the RPNBHMV model, which demonstrates the explanatory benefit of this model; 3) the RPNBHMV and RPNB models had both advantages (e.g., produced overall better prediction accuracy) and disadvantages (e.g., provided reduced prediction accuracy across the range of explanatory variables) when applied to in-sample observations (i.e., observations used to estimate the model); 4) the RPNBHMV and RPNB models might be less precise than the NB model when applied to out-of-sample observations. These findings indicate that the RPNBHMV model offers more insights and may be used for explanatory safety analysis for sites where reliable data can be collected. However, the simple NB model is more reliable – at least with the dataset used in this study - than its random parameters model counterparts for other sites where the data are unavailable or unreliable, which is a common safety evaluation scenario in practice.}

abstract = {Given the severe traffic safety issue, tremendous efforts have been devoted to identify the crash contributing factors for developing and implementing safety improvement countermeasures. According to the study findings, driving behaviors have attributed to the majority crash occurrence, among which inadequate driving capability is a key factor. Therefore, a number of studies have been conducted for developing techniques associated with the driving capability assessment and its various improvement. However, the conventional assessment approaches, such as driving license exams and vehicle insurance quotes, have only focused on basic driving skill evaluations or aggregated driving style classifications, which failed to quantify driving capability from the safety perspective with respect to the complex driving scenarios. In this study, a novel longitudinal driving capacity assessment and ranking approach was developed with naturalistic driving data. Two Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) based driving capability indicators from the perspectives of risk exposure and severity were first proposed. Then, Bayesian Tobit quantile regression (BTQR) models were introduced to explore the relationships between driving capability indicators with trip level characteristics from the aspects of travel features, operational conditions, and roadway characteristics. The modeling results concluded that nighttime driving and higher average speed would lead to higher longitudinal collision risk and its severity. Besides, the BTQR models have provided varying factors significances among different quantile levels, for instance, driving duration is only significant at high quantiles for the driving capability indicators, implying that duration only affects drivers with large longitudinal risk exposures and strong close following tendencies. Furthermore, the case studies provided how to deploy the developed model to obtain the relative longitudinal driving capability rankings. Finally, the model applications from the aspects of commercial fleet safety management and comparing the autonomous vehicles’ longitudinal driving behaviors with human drivers have been discussed.}

Although enormous efforts have been exerted to determine the factors that affect individual crash incidents, neighborhood-level crash incidence in Chinese cities has not been sufficiently analyzed. This study fills this gap by quantifying the effects of built environment factors on neighborhood-level automobile-involved crash density (NACD) in urban China and identifying its mediators and mediating effects. In American suburbs, urban sprawl is widely recognized to render neighborhoods unsafe for residence, thus leading to a high crash incidence. This study compares the characteristics of built environments between inner-city neighborhoods and the new neighborhoods that have been developed through China’s state-led suburbanization since 2008 to reveal how this suburbanization provides a safer neighborhood environment. A structural equation model is used to examine the relationships among suburbanization, built environment factors, and NACD in the city proper of Chengdu, the largest metropolis in southwest China. Thus, this study contributes new empirical evidence to the debates over urban designs that are safest for traffic. Moreover, this study enriches our understanding of different sociospatial consequences between American-style urban sprawl and China’s state-led suburbanization.}

A systematic review resulted in ten U.S studies, with 155 estimates of safety effects, that were selected for inclusion in the analysis. These studies employed either a simple before-after comparison or a cross-sectional comparison methodology. Study results were extracted by transforming the collision rates and frequencies of these studies into a log-odds ratio. The results of the meta-analysis suggest that the odds of a collision occurring are 30.9% higher for roads with reversible lanes when compared to roads without the treatment. The odds of a property-damage-only collision are predicted to be 16.6% higher, and injury collisions are predicted to be 34.9% higher with reversible lanes compared to no-treatment. The odds of a collision occurring during the peak period are expected to be 46.2% higher, while the odds of an off-peak period collision occurring are expected to be 12.8% higher. These results were statistically significant, with the exception of the off-peak period collision result. A meta-regression was performed, which regresses variables related to study type, collision type and operational characteristics of the study locations on the extracted log odds ratio. Peak period operations were positively and significantly correlated with an increase in crashes. Presence of left-turn restrictions and/or delineator/barrier were negatively correlated with crashes, whereas the presence of dynamic traffic control and static traffic control were positively correlated with crashes. Finally, cross sectional studies tend to find greater effects than before-after studies.}

abstract = {In SAE Level 3 automated driving, taking over control from automation raises significant safety concerns because drivers out of the vehicle control loop have difficulty negotiating takeover transitions. Existing studies on takeover transitions have focused on drivers’ behavioral responses to takeover requests (TORs). As a complement, this exploratory study aimed to examine drivers’ psychophysiological responses to TORs as a result of varying non-driving-related tasks (NDRTs), traffic density and TOR lead time. A total number of 102 drivers were recruited and each of them experienced 8 takeover events in a high fidelity fixed-base driving simulator. Drivers’ gaze behaviors, heart rate (HR) activities, galvanic skin responses (GSRs), and facial expressions were recorded and analyzed during two stages. First, during the automated driving stage, we found that drivers had lower heart rate variability, narrower horizontal gaze dispersion, and shorter eyes-on-road time when they had a high level of cognitive load relative to a low level of cognitive load. Second, during the takeover transition stage, 4 s lead time led to inhibited blink numbers and larger maximum and mean GSR phasic activation compared to 7 s lead time, whilst heavy traffic density resulted in increased HR acceleration patterns than light traffic density. Our results showed that psychophysiological measures can indicate specific internal states of drivers, including their workload, emotions, attention, and situation awareness in a continuous, non-invasive and real-time manner. The findings provide additional support for the value of using psychophysiological measures in automated driving and for future applications in driver monitoring systems and adaptive alert systems.}

In total, 101 eligible empirical articles are obtained. Bibliometric and context analyses are combined to identify the influential journals, scholars, keywords, use of theory, research methods, and countries or regions of the empirical samples. The 83 factors that are identified are divided into five groups, namely (a) individual characteristics, (b) workgroup interactions, (c) work and workplace design, (d) project management and organization, and (e) family, industry, and society. This indicates that the causes of safety behavior are manifold. Various factors from different systems likely work in concert to create situations in which an individual chooses to comply with safety rules and participate voluntarily in safety activities. Given this, we propose that safety behavior is only an ostensible symptom of more complex “The Self–Work–Home–Industry/Society” systems and establish a safety behavior antecedent analysis and classification model. Based on this model, we develop a resource flow model, illustrating why, how, and when the flow of resources between the five systems—namely the self system, work system, home system, work–home interface system, and industry/society system—either promotes or inhibits safety behavior. The safety behavior antecedent analysis and classification model and resource flow model are based mainly on bioecological system theory and resources theories. Avenues for future theoretical development and method designs are suggested based on the reviewed findings and the two conceptual models. The intention with this systematic review together with the two integrated conceptual models is to advance theoretical thinking on how safety behavior can be promoted, or instead, inhibited.}

The high fatality rates of single-vehicle crashes in these highways recently attracted increasing attention. Given that most studies on the factors that affect the severity of single-vehicle crashes in rural highways were conducted in developing countries, the present study investigated this issue in a Chinese setting by analyzing the single-vehicle crash data of rural highways in Anhui Province, China from 2014 to 2017. First, in consideration of the unobserved heterogeneity of crash data, a method that combines latent class analysis (LCA) and binary logistic regression (BLR), which is called LC-BLR, was applied to identify the significant factors that affect the severity of single-vehicle crashes in rural highways. Second, the goodness-of-fit and prediction accuracy of the LC-BLR model and the BLR model were compared. Results revealed that the performance of the former was more satisfactory than that of the latter. Finally, countermeasures were proposed based on the analysis of the main factors that affect each sub-class crash in the LC-BLR model. The LC-BLR model results indicated that collision typewas significant in all three sub-class models considered in the analysis, but the effects on crash severity varied. Several variables (e.g., driving license state, time of week, driver age) demonstrated a significant effect in a specific sub-class model, thereby indicating that these factors were only effective in mitigating the crash severity of one sub-class. The findings of this study can facilitate the development of cost-effective policies or countermeasures for reducing the severity of single-vehicle crashes in rural highways.}

abstract = {Background
Although numerous efforts have been devoted to exploring the effects of area-wide factors on the frequency of pedestrian crashes in neighborhoods over the past two decades, existing studies have largely failed to provide a full picture of the factors that contribute to the incidence of zonal pedestrian crashes, due to the unavailability of reliable exposure data and use of less sound analytical methods.
Methods
Based on a crowdsourced dataset in Hong Kong, we first proposed a procedure to extract pedestrian trajectories from travel-diary survey data. We then aggregated these data to 209 neighborhoods and developed a Bayesian spatially varying coefficients model to investigate the spatially non-stationary relationships between the number of pedestrian–motor vehicle (PMV) crashes and related risk factors. To dissect the role of pedestrian exposure, the estimated coefficients of models with population, walking trips, walking time, and walking distance as the measure of pedestrian exposure were presented and compared.
Results
Our results indicated substantial inconsistencies in the effects of several risk factors between the models of population and activity-based exposure measures. The model using walking trips as the measure of pedestrian exposure had the best goodness-of-fit. We also provided new insights that in addition to the unstructured variability, heterogeneity in the effects of explanatory variables on the frequency of PMV crashes could also arise from the spatially correlated effects. After adjusting for vehicle volume and pedestrian activity, road density, intersection density, bus stop density, and the number of parking lots were found to be positively associated with PMV crash frequency, whereas the percentage of motorways and median monthly income had negative associations with the risk of PMV crashes.
Conclusions
The use of population or population density as a surrogate for pedestrian exposure when modeling the frequency of zonal pedestrian crashes is expected to produce biased estimations and invalid inferences. Spatial heterogeneity should also not be negligible when modeling pedestrian crashes involving contiguous spatial units.}

Even worse, they can be responsible for severe injuries that require hospitalisation or for the development of fear of falling, particularly experienced by older people. Evidence has shown that, bus acceleration up to 1.0 m/s2 enables passengers to move in a natural way inside the moving vehicle, hence reducing instability and increasing safety. Although operators might be willing to implement such an intervention, they might also be skeptical about its impact on the operation of a service, such as timetabling, travel times, waiting times, etc. The effect of a safety-driven acceleration limit on the operational characteristics of a round trip of a bus service in London is investigated by this study. Data regarding speed, acceleration and journey time were extracted from the engine of a bus and recorded at 2 Hz. Further computations estimated the passenger waiting times and headways between the examined bus and its preceding and following buses. A vehicle movement model was used to test how these operational characteristics would be affected if the acceleration limit of 1.0 m/s2 were to be implemented. The results suggest that the journey time of the proposed accessible service would be 6 min longer than the current service and passenger waiting time would increase by 2 min. One additional bus would be required to serve the same number of passengers. A discussion of the results is provided.}

Drivers and pedestrians are more likely to violate traffic regulations, and thus adversely affect traffic safety and flow, in streets that have many such crossings. Careful planning of pedestrian crossing locations provides a solution to these problems. In this study, a corridor-based analysis of such sites is performed. Twenty-four criteria that are considered to affect pedestrian crossing locations and traffic flow aredetermined. Based on these criteria, the most suitable pedestrian crossing scenario is identified using Geographical Information Systems (GIS). The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and VlseKriterijuska Optimizacija I Komoromisno Resenje (VIKOR) from Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methods are used to evaluate the pedestrian crossing locations, and PTV VISSIM is used to examine the impact of these sites on traffic. The proposed method is then applied to a case study of Erzurum, Turkey that involves determining the best pedestrian crossing scenario. The results show that the most suitable scenario is S.2. In terms of the evaluation criteria, this alternative scenario provides an improvement of up to 50 % over the current situation. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed to reveal the effect of changing the criteria weights on the evaluation process.}

In this study, a novel threat assessment framework based on the driver’s evasive behavior, namely the CPIC, is proposed, which integrates the crash probability (CP) and inevitable crash (IC) state to be widely used by different CAS in different scenarios. In the first step of the CPIC framework, the detailed evasive driver behavior models (E-DBMs) in the form of probability density functions (PDFs) were introduced to generate more realistic collision-avoidance trajectories. Two techniques for sampling these trajectories, namely the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and adaptive Gaussian mixture framework (GMM) methods, were utilized to ensure the samples were from the area of high probability density in the E-DBMs. The CP value could be derived by considering multiple collision-avoidance trajectories. To confirm the IC state in step 2, the CPIC framework employed the driving limit-based approach for IC checking, which combined the CP value to double-check the unavoidable collision. A total of 82 critical events from the real-world naturalistic driving study, the Strategic Highway Research Program 2 (SHRP2), were extracted to verify the performance of the CPIC framework in different scenarios. Results show that the proposed method clearly revealed the risk levels when two vehicles were approaching, and 80 events were successfully identified as near crashes/crashes. Moreover, the real-time performance of the CPIC framework was also demonstrated. The findings indicate this CPIC framework could be used in practical applications of IVs in different scenarios.}

Two-way mixed ANOVAs revealed that sensation seeking and optimism bias increased over time while illusionary invulnerability and differential association fell.

Participants completed 12 lane-changing manoeuvres in three drives, categorised by degree of manual engagement with the driving task: Fully Manual Drive, Manual Intervention Required, Fully Automated Drive (Manual drive, Partial automation, Full automation). For Partial automation, drivers resumed control from the automated system and changed lane manually. For Full automation, the automated system managed the lane change, but participants initiated the manoeuvre by pulling the indicator lever. Results were compared to the Manual drive condition, where drivers controlled the vehicle at all times. For each driving condition, lane changing was initiated by drivers, at their discretion, in response to a slow-moving lead vehicle, which entered their lane. Failure to change lane did not result in a collision. To understand how different motor control requirements affected driver visual attention, eye movements to the road centre, and drivers' vertical and horizontal gaze dispersion were compared during different stages of the lane change manoeuvre, for the three drives. Results showed that drivers' attention to the road centre was generally lower for drives with less motor control requirements, especially when they were not engaged in the lane change process. However, as drivers moved closer to the lead vehicle, and prepared to change lane, the pattern of eye movements to the road centre converged, regardless of whether drivers were responsible for the manual control of the lane change. While there were no significant differences in horizontal gaze dispersion between the three drives, vertical dispersion for the two levels of automation was quite different, with higher dispersion during Partial automation, which was due to a higher reliance on the HMI placed in the centre console.}

The objective is to investigate their applicability for evaluating the real-time rear-end risk of collision of vehicles to support the operations of advanced driver assistance and automated vehicle functionalities (from driving assistance systems to fully automated vehicles). The proposed Fuzzy SSMs are evaluated and compared to other traditional metrics on the basis of empirical observations. To achieve this goal, an experimental campaign was organized in the AstaZero proving ground in Sweden. The campaign consisted of two main parts: a car-following experiment with five vehicles solely driven by Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems and a safety critical experiment, testing the response of the Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) system to avoid collisions on a static target. The proposed PFS is compared with the safe distance defined by the well-known Responsibility Sensitive Safety (RSS) model, showing that it can produce meaningful results in assessing safety conditions also without the use of crisp safety thresholds (like in the case of RSS). The CFS outperformed the well-known Time-To-Collision (TTC) SSM in the a-priori identification of the cases, where the tested vehicles were not able to avoid the collision with the static target. Moreover, results show that CFS at the time of the first deceleration is correlated with the velocity of the vehicle at the time of collisions with the target.}

abstract = {Studying the rear-end early warning methods of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) is useful for issuing early warnings and reducing traffic accidents. Establishing a corresponding driving model according to CAV characteristics is necessary when designing intelligent decision and control systems, especially for the safety speed threshold. However, since traffic systems are stochastic, there are random factors that influence car-following behavior. Therefore, this study proposes a rear-end collision warning method for CAVs based on a stochastic local multivehicle optimal speed (SLMOV) car-following model. First, the SLMOV model is proposed to characterize the car-following behavior of CAVs. Simultaneously, a stability analysis and parameter estimation method are discussed. Second, the safety distance between the CAVs changes with time because the speed of the rear vehicles satisfies the SLMOV model, which is used to calculate the safety probability of rear-end CAV collisions through an analysis of the driving process. The speed threshold is assessed by controlling the rear-end collision probability. Third, next-generation simulation (NGSIM) data are used in an empirical analysis of a rear-end collision warning method on the basis of a parameter estimation of the SLMOV model. The results present the speed thresholds of vehicles under different braking deceleration levels. Finally, the merits and demerits of fixed-speed and variable-speed adjustment time intervals are compared by considering driving safety and comfort as evaluation indexes. A reasonable CAV adjustment time interval of 0.4 s is determined. This result can be used to help develop a vehicle loading rear-end collision warning system.}

Of the 806 respondents who reported driving a motor vehicle in the last month, 34.6% said they typically drive within 3 hours of cannabis use, thereby risking DUIC, while more than 50% waited at least 7 hours before driving. A majority of respondents thought that their medical cannabis use did not affect their driving ability, and most denied any specific effects of cannabis on speeding, risk taking, reaction time, attentiveness or lane departures. A substantial majority (70.9%) felt confident in accurately assessing their own driving ability after using medical cannabis. Binary logistic regression showed that frequency of use and confidence to assess driving ability were strongly related to DUIC behaviour (i.e. driving soon after cannabis use). These results suggest a relatively high prevalence of DUIC and low perception of risk among this sample of medical cannabis users. Further research is needed to better understand the acute and chronic effects of medical cannabis use on driving and the relation between perceived and actual driving ability.}

Norwegian authorities encourage people to commute by bicycle to improve public health, decrease rush-hour traffic jams and reduce pollution. However, increasing the number of bicyclists, especially in the rush-hour traffic, may increase the number of serious bicycle injuries.
Objective
To explore trends in hospitalized bicycle injuries at a Norwegian level I trauma centre during the last decade.
Methods
Data was extracted from the prospectively registered institutional trauma registry. We identified patients admitted after bicycle injuries between 2005 and 2016.
Results
A total of 1543 patients were identified. Median age was 40 years (range 3–91) and 73 % were males. The majority of weekday injuries occurred in the morning and during the afternoon rush-hour, peaking at 8 am. and 4 pm. The annual number of admitted bicycle injuries increased from 79 to 184 during the study period. Also, an increase in the share of bicyclists using helmets was observed. The median Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 10 remained unchanged. 63 % had serious trauma (ISS ≥ 9), while 34 % suffered severe trauma (ISS ≥ 16). The absolute number of both serious and severe trauma increased annually. 36 % had head and neck injuries, while 16 % had chest injuries graded with Abbreviated Injury Scale ≥3. Loss of consciousness with Glasgow Coma Scale score <9 was seen in 7%. Median length of hospitalization was 3 days, and 39 % had surgery in one or more body regions. The 30-day mortality was 2.3 %.
Conclusions
The number of admitted bicycle injuries to our trauma centre is increasing. Rush-hour injuries dominate during weekdays. Bicycle injuries can be devastating and deserve more public attention to promote road safety.}

With human error attributions, participants were in greater agreement with the statement that an individual deserved to be punished for the accident and in less agreement that an organization or company was responsible for the accident. People also perceived past human error accidents to have been more preventable, although ratings of prospective preventability were not significantly different for human error versus other attributions. The idiosyncratic details of particular accidents contributed more variance to perceptions than the causal attribution. The same pattern of results was replicated in a second experiment (N = 1195), and new analyses found no evidence that the relationship between causal attributions and perceptions was moderated by the personal relevance of the news story. Our findings suggested that, when an accident is attributed to human error in media, the public may be less likely to expect examination or mitigation of systemic shortcomings (e.g., in design, organizational practices, etc.) that precipitate accidents.}

This study proposes a new approach, namely Generalized Negative Binomial-P (GNB-P) model, to model the complex relationship between crashes and different exposure measures by crash type for intersections, which helps not only identify the most reliable exposure measure for intersection SPFs, but also explore the most appropriate functional form of the NB models. To this end, three types of SPF functional forms, namely Power function, Hoerl function 1 and Hoerl function 2 with different exposure measures including major road AADT, minor road AADT and total AADT were estimated by crash type for stop-controlled and two types of signalized intersections. The over-dispersion of the SPF models was estimated using the exposure measures to account for crash data variation across different intersections. The SPF estimation results highlighted that the mean-variance structure of NB models is not consistent and varies by crash data. The over-dispersion of SPFs by crash type is not constant and varies across different intersections. The minor road AADT is shown to be positively correlated with the over-dispersion of SPFs in estimating crash counts for Same-Direction Crashes (SDC), Intersecting-Direction Crashes (IDC) and Single-Vehicle Crashes (SVC). Estimating the over-dispersion using exposure measures results in more reliable SPF results. Furthermore, it is found that the Power function with major road and minor road AADT as the exposure measure performs the best in estimating SPFs for Opposite-Direction Crashes (ODC). The Hoerl function 2 with total AADT and the proportion of minor road AADT over the total as the exposure measure performs the best in estimating SVC SPFs for intersections. The Hoerl function 1 with major road and minor road AADT as the exposure measure is more accurate in estimating SPFs for both SDC and IDC.}

abstract = {Rationale
Car-driving performance is negatively affected by the intake of alcohol, tranquillizers, sedatives and sleep deprivation. Although several studies have shown that the standard deviation of the lateral position on the road (SDLP) is sensitive to drug-induced changes in simulated and real driving performance tests, this parameter alone might not fully assess and quantify deviant or unsafe driving.
Objective
Using machine learning we investigated if including multiple simulator-derived parameters, rather than the SDLP alone would provide a more accurate assessment of the effect of substances affecting driving performance. We specifically analysed the effects of alcohol and alprazolam.
Methods
The data used in the present study were collected during a previous study on driving effects of alcohol and alprazolam in 24 healthy subjects (12 M, 12 F, mean age 26 years, range 20–43 years). Various driving features, such as speed and steering variations, were quantified and the influence of administration of alcohol or alprazolam was assessed to assist in designing a predictive model for abnormal driving behaviour.
Results
Adding additional features besides the SDLP increased the model performance for prediction of drug-induced abnormal driving behaviour (from an accuracy of 65 %–83 % after alprazolam intake and from 50 % to 76 % after alcohol ingestion). Driving behaviour influenced by alcohol and alprazolam was characterised by different feature importance, indicating that the two interventions influenced driving behaviour in a different way.
Conclusion
Machine learning using multiple driving features in addition to the state-of-the-art SDLP improves the assessment of drug-induced abnormal driving behaviour. The created models may facilitate quantitative description of abnormal driving behaviour in the development and application of psychopharmacological medicines. Our models require further validation using similar and unknown interventions.}

Conﬂict occurrences are generated through simulating vehicular interactions based on this model. Simulation experiments are conducted with different density and illuminance to evaluate the safety impacts of sun glare. Comparison of simulated conﬂict occurrences shows that rear-end conflicts occur more frequently as illuminance and density get higher. And the impacts of sun glare are more obvious on weak conflicts in moderate-density flow and more severe conflicts in high-density flows, respectively. To alleviate the negative impacts of sun glare, a sunshade system is designed based on the quantitative results.}

abstract = {In recent years, globally quantile-based model (e.g. quantile regression) and spatially conditional mean models (e.g. geographically weighted regression) have been widely and commonly employed in macro-level safety analysis. The former ones assume that the model coefficients are fixed over space, while the latter ones only represent the entire distribution of variable effects by a single concentrated trend. However, the influence of crash related factors on the distribution of crash frequency is observed to vary over space and across different quantiles. Therefore, a geographically weighted Poisson quantile regression (GWPQR) model is employed to investigate the spatial heterogeneity of variable effects crossing different quantiles. Five categories, including exposure, socio-economic, transportation, network and land use were selected to estimate the spatial effects on crash frequency. In the case study, vehicle related crashes collected in New York City were used to validate the predicted performance of the proposed models. The results show that the GWPQR outperforms the NB, QR and GWNBR for modeling the skewed distribution, reconstructing the crash distribution and capturing the unobserved spatial heterogeneity. Additionally, the significant coefficients are further used to classify all 21 variables into key, important and general parts. Then we discuss how these factors affects the regional crashes over space and distribution of crash frequency. This study confirms that the influencing factors have varying effects on different quantiles of distribution and on different regions, which could be helpful to provide support for making safety countermeasures and policies at urban regional level.}

Separately estimating the severity levels of two parties ignoring their potential correlation may lead to biased estimation; however, modelling their severity levels simultaneously by using a bivariate modelling approach requires a complex model setting. Thus, this study used generalized estimating equations (GEE) to accommodate potential correlations when estimating the crash severity levels of two parties. To investigate the performance of the GEE models, a case study on a total of 2493 crashes at 214 signalized intersections in Taipei City in 2013 is conducted. Univariate ordered probit model, bivariate ordered probit model, and GEE ordered probit model (GEE-OP) with different working matrices are respectively estimated and compared. The estimation results of GEE models showed that the GEE-OP with the exchangeable working matrix performs best and the most influential factor contributing to crash severity is vehicle type (motorcycle), followed by speeding, angle impact, and alcoholic use. Thus, to curtail motorcycle usage by increasing parking fee or reducing parking space of motorcycles, to crack down on speeding and alcoholic use, and to redesign the signal timings to avoid possible angle impact accidents are identified as key countermeasures.}

This is true for SAE level 2, where monitoring the external environment is required; it is also true for level 3, where drivers must react quickly and safely to a take-over request. Without such monitoring, even if only partial, drivers are considered out-of-the-loop (OOTL) and safety may be compromised. The OOTL phenomenon may be particularly important for long automated driving periods during which mind wandering can occur. This study scrutinized drivers’ visual behaviour for 18 min of highly automated driving. Intersections between gaze and 13 areas of interest (AOIs) were analysed, considering both static and dynamic indicators. An estimation of self-reported mind wandering based on gaze behaviour was performed using partial least squares (PLS) regression models. The outputs of the PLS regressions allowed defining visual strategies associated with good monitoring of the driving scene. This information may enable online estimation of the OOTL phenomenon based on a driver’s spontaneous visual behaviour.}

To meet the higher requirements of driving safety in CAVs environment, it is necessary to develop more effective safety evaluation indicators that combine all the traffic information received by the vehicle. To this end, this study proposes a novel methodology for risk perception and warning strategy based on safety potential field model to minimize driving risk in the CAVs environment. A dynamic safety potential field model was constructed to describe the spatial distribution of driving risk encountered by vehicles. This safety potential field model can comprehensively consider the impact of various types of traffic information on driving risk. And then, a novel driving risk indicator, named potential field indicator (PFI), was established to evaluate the level of driving risk. Finally, an early warning strategy was proposed to prevent accidents, whose performance was evaluated by several simulations carried out through SUMO simulator. The comparison with some classic risk indicators indicate that our proposed PFI can more accurately reflect the actual driving risk faced by vehicles under different vehicle motion states and thus is more suitable for driving risk assessment in the CAVs environment. It is expected that the findings in this study could be valuable in improving the performance of strategic decision-making in driver assistance systems in the CAVs environment.}

However, due to the insufficient understanding of the human driving strategy and style, the conflicts between ICVs and human drivers have arisen public attention, threatening the road safety and bottlenecking the development of ICV. In order to embed the human driving strategy in the intelligent driving system, researchers have been rolling out efforts on driver modeling. Most driver models, however, still suffer from the limited application scope or poor transparency. Within our finite horizons, a unified and readable driver model for various driving scenarios is generally unobtainable. In this work, we tried to model the human driving strategy from an aspect of human nature, that is, the way human drivers respond to the driving risk. We employed the risk field theory (also known as the safety field theory) to model the environmental risk in a comprehensive manner. By studying the risk-response strategy from the driving data of 24 human drivers, we proposed a unified structure, which we call the risk-response driver model (RRDM), to model the human driving strategy. This model provides access to learning not only the average driving strategy of a group of human drivers but also the specific driving style of a single driver. The explicit and readable driving strategy produced by RRDM can be directly employed to reproduce human-like longitudinal driving control. We verified the performance of our model in car-following tasks and found that its human-like driving performance is recoverable among the human drivers who participated in the tests.}

Nevertheless, the current U.S. seat belt use rate of 89.6% (Enriquez \& Pickrell, 2019) indicates that a relatively small but pervasive portion of the population does not wear seat belts on a full-time basis. Whereas much is known about the demographic predictors of seat belt use, far less is understood about psychological factors that predict individual proclivities toward using or not using a seat belt. In this study, we examined some of these potential psychological predictors. A probability-based web survey was conducted with 6,038 U.S. residents aged 16 or older who reported having driven or ridden in a car in the past year. We measured self-reported seat belt use and 18 psychological constructs and found that delay of gratification, life satisfaction, risk aversion, risk perception, and resistance to peer influence were positively associated with belt use. Impulsivity and social resistance orientation were negatively associated with belt use. Prior research has shown that psychological factors like delay of gratification, risk aversion/perception, and impulsivity predict other health behaviors (e.g., cigarette smoking, sunscreen use); our results extend this literature to seat belts and can aid the development of traffic safety programs targeted at non-users who—due to such factors—may be resistant to more traditional countermeasures such as legislation and enforcement.}

abstract = {Risky lane change behavior of drivers normally will pose some negative impacts on traffic safety. To ensure a lane change safe and prevent potential accidents, it is important to recognize some lane-changing conditions with potential risks in advance. Despite the researches on traffic safety assessment have been developed for decades, most of the existing researches are mainly interesting in how to estimate the overall safety of the lane-changing process based on historical data. These methods tend to ignore the interactive impacts between lane-changing vehicle and its surrounding vehicles, and have the disadvantages of the long-term evaluation period and single evaluation index. To address these gaps, this study presents a temporal and spatial risk estimation (TSRE) to recognize lane-changing risk in real-time. However, this study concentrates on the instantaneous risk for a lane change event, considering temporal and spatial dimensions for the current lane change circumstance on the highway. After processing the realistic vehicle trajectory dataset, this study extracted 1444 groups of lane change samples, and then incorporates the temporal risk level (TRL) and spatial risk level (SRL) into a comprehensive risk index by applying fault tree analysis. Furthermore, SRL and comprehensive risk index are both used to determine whether the traffic condition of a lane change is safe, and it can effectively overcome the conventional recognition defects that existed in other methods. To achieve a better evaluation effect, the sensitivity tests of recognition accuracy for various risk threshold combinations were carried out. Ultimately, experimental results showed that the proposed TSRE model achieved 97.45 %, 97.79 %, 84.1 % and 85.05 % accuracy rate in terms of classifying the risky lane change samples, traffic conflicts, risky frames and safe frames, when an appropriate risk threshold combination was selected. This encouraging finding can provide the basis for algorithm design of the lane change warning system for connected vehicles.}

To address this challenge, we aimed to predict drivers’ takeover performance before the issue of a takeover request (TOR) by analyzing drivers’ physiological data and external environment data. We used data sets from two human-in-the-loop experiments, wherein drivers engaged in non-driving-related tasks (NDRTs) were requested to take over control from automated driving in various situations. Drivers’ physiological data included heart rate indices, galvanic skin response indices, and eye-tracking metrics. Driving environment data included scenario type, traffic density, and TOR lead time. Drivers’ takeover performance was categorized as good or bad according to their driving behaviors during the transition period and was treated as the ground truth. Using six machine learning methods, we found that the random forest classifier performed the best and was able to predict drivers’ takeover performance when they were engaged in NDRTs with different levels of cognitive load. We recommended 3 s as the optimal time window to predict takeover performance using the random forest classifier, with an accuracy of 84.3% and an F1-score of 64.0%. Our findings have implications for the algorithm development of driver state detection and the design of adaptive in-vehicle alert systems in conditionally automated driving.}

abstract = {Run-off the road crashes account for a significant proportion of severe injuries to vehicle occupants. Traffic barriers have been installed with an objective to keep vehicles on the roadway, and prevent them from hitting natural obstacles like trees or boulders. However, still injuries and fatalities of barrier crashes account for high proportion of fatalities on roadway. Due to challenging geometrics characteristics of Wyoming’s roadway, a high mileage of barriers has been installed in the state. The high mileages of barriers result in a high number of barrier crashes in terms of crash frequency and severity due to high exposure. Previous studies mainly focused on crash frequency or individual crash severity. However, it has been recognized the importance of accounting for both aspects of crash severity, and crash frequency. So, in this study, crashes are aggregated across different barriers, and those crashes were converted into costs by considering the impacts of both crash severity and frequency. However, one of the main challenges of this type of dataset is highly skewness of crash data due to its sparseness nature. An improper use of model distribution of crash cost would result in biased estimations of the covariates, and erroneous results. Thus, in order to address this issue, a semi-parametric method of quantile regression technique was implemented to account for the skewness of the response by relaxing model distribution parameters. Also, to account for the heterogeneity in the dataset due to barriers' types, a random intercept model accounting for the structure of the data was implemented. In addition, interaction terms between significant predictors were considered. Understanding what factors with which magnitude contribute to the barrier crash costs is crucial for the future barriers’ optimization process. Thus, contributory factors to barriers crash cost with high, medium, and low values, corresponding to 95th, 70th, and 60th percentiles were considered, and a comparison was made across these models. It was found, for instance, that although factors such as rollover, driving under the influence, and presence of heavy truck all have contributory impacts on the cost of crashes, their impacts are greater on higher quantiles, or higher barriers’ costs. These models were compared from various perspectives such as intra class correlation (ICC), and standard error of coefficients. This study highlights the changes in coefficient estimates while modeling crash costs.}

The Advanced-CSW system is based on Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) enabling vehicle-infrastructure (V2I) communication. Anytime the vehicle is speeding, the guided message will be displayed until the vehicle’s speed is within compliant range. Drivers who use the Advanced-CSW can receive multiple guided messages from the in-vehicle heads-up display through the entire course of navigating through horizontal curves. Thirty participants are recruited to perform the driving experiment on the simulator of driving through a series of horizontal curves under various geometric, roadway and traffic conditions. These conditions include different curve severity, illumination, and pavement wetness levels. The Advanced-CSW system’s performance was evaluated in terms of the speed difference, which measures the gap between the in-curve mean speed and curve advisory speed. The results were compared with the performance of speed difference by driving with CSW or CSO through the entire curve. The experiment data was modeled using the mixed linear model with random effects, which includes the individual’s driving behavior. In summary, when male drivers navigate through the horizontal curves under different curve speed warning systems, their speed compliance is significantly increased with continuous and guided messages provided in comparison with the speed compliance under the one-time curve speed warning message and the curve sign only. Female drivers improve their speed compliance in the curve by using curve signs only comparing to using one-time curve speed warning message or continuous guided curve speed warning messages. Also, male drivers’ speed differences by using the guided system are significantly reduced by 6.53∼7.68 mi/h compared to driving with curve signs only or one-time curve speed warning message. In addition, there is also a speed reduction of 1.81 mi/h if male drivers receiving continuous guided messages in the curve during the daytime than during the nighttime. The proposed adaptive system based on that is adaptive to the vehicle’s real-time speed and location by providing a new direction in designing effective curve warning systems. The speed-guided messages through the entire course of approaching, entering, navigating, and leaving horizontal curves can solve the current issue of speed incompliance by using the existing curve warning systems.}

The method was implemented upon the open-source framework openPASS and can simulate results for different active safety system setups and facilitates the prediction of system capabilities to decrease the relative impact velocities and collision configurations such as the point of impact. A demonstration case was performed where the scenario catalog was derived and used to evaluate pedestrian collisions with and without a generic autonomous emergency braking (AEB) system. The AEB system aims to intervene in the event of an impending collision and might affect the outcome of a baseline scenario. The study indicated a change in the collision configuration and identified conflict situations less affected by the system. A particularly interesting finding was that some scenarios even led to a higher number of collisions (at lower impact) for the AEB intervention in comparison to the baseline cases.}

A total of 14,391 pedestrians were involved in these crashes, resulting in 612 (4.3%) pedestrian fatalities, 11,576 (80.4%) pedestrian injuries, and 2203 (15.3%) property damage only outcomes. The objective is to analyze crash records, as similarly compiled by other states, to show how lives potentially saved by improved factor levels can be estimated as needed for benefit-cost comparisons of alternative countermeasures. Odds ratios of fatal versus non-fatal pedestrian outcomes are computed both independently (unadjusted) and from logistic regression (adjusted) for each factor level accounting for possible correlations between factors. Also computed are odds ratios for fatal plus incapacitating injuries and odds ratios for just 2011−2016 versus all years. This study found that intersection proximity, lighting condition, vehicle type and speed, pedestrian age, pedestrian impairment, and driver impairment by drugs or alcohol were all significant factors associated with the severity of pedestrian outcomes from motor vehicle crashes. Risk ratios from these odds ratios are used to estimate lives potentially saved by having better factor levels present at the time of these crashes. These estimates reflect the relative magnitudes of benefits that might be achieved by potential countermeasures taking into account the number of cases affected.}

abstract = {Traffic accidents are a global concern due to the elevated mortality rates of both drivers and pedestrians. The World Health Organization declared 2011-2020 as the Decade of Action for Road Safety, endorsing initiatives to reduce traffic-related deaths. Yet, despite these incentives, fatal accidents still occur. Different studies have linked deficits in executive functions to risky driving attitudes and crashes. The present study focuses on demographic, cognitive and personality factors, related to the prefrontal cortex, that are characteristic of drivers prone to risky behavior behind the wheel. The penalty Points System was used to classify drivers as “safe”, with no point loss over a two-year period, or “risky”, with full point loss during the same interval. A neuropsychological assessment of prefrontal cognitive functions was carried out on each group to identify variables associated with safe and risky behavior. Neuropsychological indexes were obtained from a continuous performance task without cue (Simple Attention), a continuous performance task with cue (Conditioned Attention), the Tower of Hanoi test and the Neurologically-related Changes in Personality Inventory (NECHAPI). A Discriminant Analysis (DA) found that education level, reaction times in Simple and Conditioned Attention, learning errors in the Tower of Hanoi and vulnerability in the personality test, best predicted whether drivers were likely to be in the safe or risky group. Finally, a cross-validation analysis performed on the same sample correctly classified 87.5% of the drivers. These data suggest that prefrontal dysfunction contributes to risky behavior behind the wheel. The inclusion of cognitive programs to identify and train drivers with this propensity could reduce risky driving, and consequently, save lives on the road.}

Regional cultures and social rules that govern acceptable behavior may influence drivers’ interpretation of a traffic situation and, consequently, the correct identification of potentially hazardous situations. Here, we aimed to compare hazard perception skills among four European countries that differ in their traffic culture, policies to reduce traffic risks, and fatal crashes: Ukraine, Italy, Spain, and Sweden. We developed a static hazard perception test in which driving scenes with different levels of braking affordance were presented while drivers’ gaze was recorded. The test required drivers to indicate the action they would undertake: to brake vs. to keep driving. We assessed 218 young adult drivers. Multilevel models revealed that the scenes’ levels of braking affordance (i.e., road hazard) modulated drivers’ behavior. As the levels of braking affordance increased, drivers’ responses became faster and their gaze entropy decreased (i.e., visual search strategy became less erratic). The country of origin influenced these effects. Ukrainian drivers were the fastest and Swedish drivers were the slowest to respond. For all countries, the decrement in response times was less marked in the case of experienced drivers. Also, Spanish drivers showed the most structured (least erratic) visual search strategy, whereas the Italians had the most rigid (most constant) one. These results suggest that road hazard perception can be defined cross-culturally, with cultural factors (e.g., traffic climate, legislation) modulating response times and visual search strategies. Our results also support the idea that a multimodal assessment methodology is possible for mass testing of road hazard perception and its outcomes would be relevant to understand how different traffic cultures shape driving behavior.}

Lane support systems (LSS) are based on advanced computer vision technologies and they are expected to give safety benefits in reducing Ran of Road and head-on crashes comparable to already consolidated physical countermeasures like rumble strips. Anyway, despite the assumed technology readiness, there is still much uncertainty regarding the needs of vision systems for “reading” the road and limited results are still available from in field testing. In such framework the paper presents an experimental test of LSS performance carried out in two lane rural roads with different geometric alignments and sections characterized by variable maintenance conditions for pavement and markings. LSS faults were detected in 2.6 % of the sections, running the roads in day light and dry pavement conditions. Logit models were developed to better understand road characteristics and conditions that can affect the system performance. The Firth penalized maximum-likelihood method was applied to estimate the logistic regression coefficients and standard errors to account for the rareness of the events. Results show that luminance coefficient of marking in diffuse lighting conditions (Qd) and horizontal curvature radius (1/R) are the main predictors of system fault. Based on the case study and test conditions, other marking characteristics, longitudinal cracking, verge width and running speed resulted not significant in explaining the probability of fault. Thresholds values for Qd and 1/R are suggested and remarks on road maintenance and design standards presented.}

Consequently, ubiquitous internal and external communication (controls, commands, and data) within all CAV-related nodes is inevitably the gatekeeper for the smooth operation. Therefore, it is a primary vulnerable area for cyber-attacks that entails stringent and efficient measures in the form of "cybersecurity". There is a lack of systematic and comprehensive review of the literature on cyber-attacks on the CAVs, respective mitigation strategies, anticipated readiness, and research directions for the future. This study aims to analyse, synthesise, and interpret critical areas for the roll-out and progression of CAVs in combating cyber-attacks. Specifically, we described in a structured way a holistic view of potentially critical avenues, which lies at the heart of CAV cybersecurity research. We synthesise their scope with a particular focus on ensuring effective CAVs deployment and reducing the probability of cyber-attack failures. We present the CAVs communication framework in an integrated form, i.e., from In-Vehicle (IV) communication to Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2X) communication with a visual flowchart to provide a transparent picture of all the interfaces for potential cyber-attacks. The vulnerability of CAVs by proximity (or physical) access to cyber-attacks is outlined with future recommendations. There is a detailed description of why the orthodox cybersecurity approaches in Cyber-Physical System (CPS) are not adequate to counter cyber-attacks on the CAVs. Further, we synthesised a table with consolidated details of the cyber-attacks on the CAVs, the respective CAV communication system, its impact, and the corresponding mitigation strategies. It is believed that the literature discussed, and the findings reached in this paper are of great value to CAV researchers, technology developers, and decision-makers in shaping and developing a robust CAV-cybersecurity framework.}

Indeed, drivers must wait for an adequate gap in oncoming traffic to safely complete a left-turn maneuver. In this context, incorrectly assessed gaps can lead to severe crashes and severe traffic delays at intersections. This study tests the potential of Augmented Reality (AR) technology, built into connected vehicle technology, to improve the safety of left-turn maneuvers of connected vehicles by adding visual virtual information to the driver. To achieve this goal, a driving simulator study was carried out. The effectiveness of the system was tested, and the ability of young drivers to detect adequate gaps between vehicles in the opposite lane (with right of way) to safely turn left was assessed with and without AR warnings at a two-way stop-controlled intersection under a connected vehicles environment. In the scenario projected on the simulation screen, three different virtual warnings were displayed and tested: a green/red traffic light, which informs the driver of the availability of an appropriate gap between opposing vehicles; a traffic light with a timer showing the number of seconds available to safely perform the left-turn maneuver; a traffic light with an additionally activated audio warning system. Significant positive effects of AR warnings on driving performance and traffic safety were observed: the number of safe left-turns increased and the delays at the intersection decreased. In addition, AR signaling improved driving behavior both during the waiting time, with many more drivers waiting for the gap in front of the stop line to avoid disrupting oncoming traffic, and turning movement, reducing the average time it took to complete the left-turn maneuver. This study confirmed the great potential of AR and connected vehicle technologies to improve general safety conditions on the road network, especially under risky situations and difficult maneuvers.}

abstract = {Cell phone use while driving is becoming a key problem in traffic safety as it causes visual-manual distraction and has been linked to increases in crash rates. The use of hand-held phones has been banned in several countries, yet research comparing the safety of hands-free phone use with hand-held has produced inconsistent results. Analysis of specific phone use characteristics could help move this traffic safety problem toward a solution, but few studies have considered the influence on driving performance of specific sets of phone use characteristics in combination with other factors such as driving context and driver demographic characteristics. The main objective of this paper is therefore to identify and analyze these factors to determine their effects on driving performance indicators such as speed changes. To this end, 1244 phone events were collected from 52 drivers from the Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study (SH-NDS), the first naturalistic driving data in China. Because subtasks within a phone event may cause different visual-manual distractions, a hierarchical coding structure for phone events was built. A total of 5662 eyes-off-road (EOR) cases and 4237 subtasks were extracted. The results showed that on average, the participating drivers used the phone for 6.08 % of their driving time; for 17 % of phone use time, drivers used both hands to manipulate the phone; and their average EOR time was 3.16 s, which is equivalent to driving blindly for 22.82 m at an average speed of 7.22 m/s, or 26 km/hr. The effect of phone use on driving performance, including speed, headway, and lane offset, was analyzed with ANOVA. Results showed that standard deviations (SD) of all three parameters were significantly lower during phone periods than during baseline periods. The speed SD during phone use was 0.95 lower than baseline, the headway SD was 2.48 lower, and the absolute lane offset SD was 685.72 lower than baseline. These lower SDs indicate that drivers operated their vehicles with less fluctuation during phone use. While we were unable to find similar differences in mean speed and mean headway, mean lane offset was also significantly lower with phone use than without. A decision tree was developed to identify the factors influencing driver speed change. Results showed that drivers increased, decreased, or maintained speed depending on the type and duration of phone tasks, the duration of the trip, and the type of roadway. Greater understanding of the specific aspects of phone use and their influences on driver distraction and performance will permit the development of more effective countermeasures, including legislation, enforcement, blocking technologies, social norms education, and sending Do Not Disturb messages to callers, all of which will be required to mitigate continued deaths and injuries from phone use while driving.}

Cases included 28,620 drivers of moving private cars, vans and off-road vehicles involved in single crashes plus 50,100 drivers deemed responsible for clean collisions (i.e. those in which only one driver was labeled as responsible). In accordance with the quasi-induce exposure approach, drivers not responsible for clean collisions comprised the control group (N = 51,656). Logistic and multinomial regression models were used to estimate crude and adjusted Odds Ratios or Relative Risk Ratios between each reason for DWVL and the risk of being a case of all, single and multi-vehicle collisions. A significant association was found between all reasons for DWVL and the risk of causing a road crash. This association was particularly high for drivers with a suspended license and drivers who had never obtained a license. In these subgroups of drivers, the proportion of the relationship explained by high-risk driving behaviors is high.

This study explores the factors related to the injury severity outcome of single-bicycle crashes. We use single-bicycle crash data obtained from medical records collected in the period 2010–2015 combined with road maintenance data. The data includes three injury severity categories: ‘severe injury’, ‘slight injury’, ‘no injury’. The relation between the factors surrounding single-bicycle crashes and the resulting injury severity is estimated using a latent class ordered probit model. The model estimation identifies three latent classes where the likelihood of cyclist membership depends on the bicyclist's age and gender. Furthermore, several factors appear to affect the likelihood of injuries in single-bicycle crashes. These are the road geometry (i.e. if the crash occurred on a bicycle lane or a road section), maintenance level, and the interaction between road geometry and maintenance level. The findings suggest that single-bicycle crashes on road sections result in more severe injuries than single-bicycle crashes on bicycle lanes. The largest effect is seen when a single-bicycle crash occurs on a road section with a poorly maintained bicycle lane being available. Crashes on low volume roads with few bicyclists are also related to an increased probability of severe injury as well as crashes occurring after dark.}

: Due to demographic change, the number of older drivers with impaired driving skills will increase in the next decades. The current study aimed at the validation and extension of the screening tool Safety Advice For Elderly drivers (SAFE) that allows a cost-efficient assessment of driving-related risk factors in older drivers.
Method
: Seventy-four older drivers aged ≥65 years (M = 77 years) recruited from the general population were included in this prospective observational study. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and hierarchical logistic regression analyses were utilized to examine whether the SAFE and further evidence-based driving-related factors may allow the differentiation between fit and unfit older drivers assessed in standardized on-road driving assessments.
Results
: ROC analyses revealed significant diagnostic accuracy of the number of SAFE risk factors in differentiating between fit and unfit older drivers (AUC = 0.71). A stepwise logistic regression model revealed that adding further evidence-based risk factors into the SAFE clearly improved diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.85).
Discussion
: The current study shows that the risk assessed by the SAFE predicts on-road driving fitness in older adults. However, the results also suggest a need for a modification of the SAFE by the inclusion of additional evidence-based risk factors. With sensitivity and specificity scores of about 90 % and 75 %, this modified version may be more suitable for clinical use.}

Randomized controlled trials examining the effects of a driving intervention among older adults ≥ 50 years of age were included. Thirty-one studies were identified using a systematic literature review, and 26 were included in meta-analyses. The following types of driving interventions were identified: physical retraining/exercise (e.g., flexibility and coordination training); visual-perceptual training (e.g., improving figure-ground discrimination); cognitive training (e.g., Useful Field of View cognitive training); education (e.g., classroom driver refresher course); context-specific training (i.e., on-road training in car, driving simulator training); combined intervention approaches (e.g., education and context-specific training combined). Effect sizes were calculated for each driving intervention type relative to control groups using random-effects. Physical retraining/exercise, visual-perceptual training, and combined intervention approaches demonstrated medium to large effects on on-road driving performance, ds = 0.564–1.061, ps < .050.

Education and context-specific approaches were not efficacious to improve driving safety outcomes, ps> .050. In summary, skill-specific interventions (physical retraining/exercise, visual-perceptual training, cognitive training) and combined intervention approaches improved on-road driving performance and reduced at-fault crashes. Optimizing interventions that target age-related functional declines and combined intervention approaches is recommended.}

abstract = {Objective
This paper investigates the effectiveness of in-vehicle displays in supporting drivers’ anticipation of traffic conflicts in automated vehicles (AVs).
Background
Providing takeover requests (TORs) along with information on automation capability (AC) has been found effective in supporting AV drivers’ reactions to traffic conflicts. However, it is unclear what type of information can support drivers in anticipating traffic conflicts, so they can intervene (pre-event action) or prepare to intervene (pre-event preparation) proactively to avert them.
Method
In a driving simulator study with 24 experienced and 24 novice drivers, we evaluated the effectiveness of two in-vehicle displays in supporting anticipatory driving in AVs with adaptive cruise control and lane keeping assistance: TORAC (TOR + AC information) and STTORAC displays (surrounding traffic (ST) information + TOR + AC information). Both displays were evaluated against a baseline display that only showed whether the automation was engaged.
Results
Compared to the baseline display, STTORAC led to more anticipatory driving behaviors (pre-event action or pre-event preparation) while TORAC led to less, along with decreased attention to environmental cues that indicated an upcoming event. STTORAC led to the highest level of driving safety, as indicated by minimum gap time for scenarios that required driver intervention, followed by TORAC, and then the baseline display.
Conclusions
Providing surrounding traffic information to drivers of AVs, in addition to TORs and automation capability information, can support their anticipation of potential traffic conflicts. Without the surrounding traffic information, drivers can over-rely on displays that provide TORs and automation capability information.}

abstract = {The combined contribution to highway safety of pavement surface and geometric design indicators is not well investigated due to the complexity of data collection and high time variability of pavement surface conditions. Introduction of high efficiency equipment for comprehensive road surveys is mitigating this issue, expanding possibilities of data integration. In this framework, the present study developed crash modification functions (CMFs) of pavement surface and geometric design indicators for different crash types (total, run-off-the-road, and others), pavement conditions (dry and wet), and lighting conditions (daytime and nighttime) based on data from two-lane rural highways in Italy. Geometric and pavement data were surveyed with the Automatic Road Analyzer and the Grip Tester. Pavement surface condition data were corrected to the crash time by pavement performance deterioration models based on traffic load to account for the variation in pavement conditions over time. Crash, traffic and weather data were retrieved from national and local databases. This study used safety performance functions (SPFs), fitted with generalized linear modelling techniques and a negative binomial distribution error structure, for developing CMFs. The SPFs were used to quantify the effect of a specific variable on crash occurrence and CMFs were then derived from the model coefficients. CMFs were developed for the following parameters: Grip Number, International Roughness Index, curvature change ratio, coefficient of variation of the curvature, maximum superelevation deficiency, and minimum lane width. According to the study results, an increase in friction, as measured by the Grip Number, is associated with a reduction in crash frequency while an increase in roughness, as measured by the International Roughness Index, is associated with an increase in crash frequency. Thus, both pavement maintenance treatments aimed at increasing friction as well as treatments aimed at reducing irregularities have a positive safety effect, especially when wet, run-off-the-road or nighttime crashes are overrepresented. Study results allow to effectively integrate pavement management systems and safety management systems. When developing paving schedules, transportation agencies often base their decisions on asset management condition targets but do not explicitly account for the role of pavement conditions in highway safety. Availability of CMFs for both pavement surface parameters as well as geometric design parameters is crucial to improve pavement and geometric characteristics considering their safety effects.}

This study determines PRT at various spacings in approaching and braking conditions, and examines the association of PRT and deceleration rate with crash risk. For these tasks, a total of 50 drivers’ behavior was observed in a driving simulator experiment with 4 different scenarios – reaction to a decelerating lead vehicle, reaction to a stopped lead vehicle, perception of a lead vehicle’s speed change, and perception of a slow-moving lead vehicle. The study tested three hypotheses of PRT including perception and reaction thresholds and the evidence accumulation framework using a visual variable (tau-inverse). It was found that the drivers neither reacted after a specific PRT from the start of perception nor reacted at a specific value of tau-inverse. Rather, the drivers generally reacted when the accumulation of evidence (tau-inverse) over time reached a threshold. It was also found that the magnitude of deceleration rate depends on the tau-inverse at the start of braking and hence, higher crash risk was associated with higher level of urgency and insufficient brake force rather than longer PRT. This study demonstrates that the evidence accumulation framework is a promising method of predicting driver reaction in approaching and braking conditions for different types of lead vehicle, and the level of urgency is important for predicting the probability of crash.}

This study evaluated crash risk factors for ride-hailing drivers, including driving history and ride-hailing operational characteristics, using a sample of 189,815 drivers. We utilized the Poisson generalized additive model to accommodate for the potential nonlinear relationship between crash rate and risk factors. Results showed that crash history, the percentage of long-shift bookings, driving distance, operations during peak hours, years of being a ride-hailing driver, and passenger rating were significantly associated with crash risk. Several factors showed nonlinear relationships with crash risk. We adopted the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method to assess and visualize the impact of each risk factor. The results indicated that passenger average rating, total driving distance, and crash history were the leading contributing factors. The findings of this study provide critical information for the development of safety countermeasures, driver education programs, as well as safety regulations for the ride-hailing industry.}

Our research examines distraction caused by smartwatch use in comparison to mobile phone use while driving. It also studies the difference in distractions caused by inbound text messages versus inbound voice messages, and outbound replies through text messages versus outbound voice replies. A within-subject experiment was conducted in a driving simulator where 31 participants received and answered text messages under four conditions: they received notifications (1) on a mobile phone, (2) on a smartwatch, and (3) on a speaker, and then responded orally to these messages. They also (4) received messages in a “texting” condition where they had to reply through text to the notifications. Eye tracking gaze distribution results show that participants were more distracted in the smartwatch condition than in the mobile phone condition, they were less distracted in the speaker condition than in the phone condition, and they were more distracted in the texting condition than in any of the others. The participants’ driving performance remained the same in all conditions except in the texting condition, wherein it became worse. Eye tracking and pupillometry results suggest that participants’ mental workload might be lower in the texting condition than in the other three conditions, although this result might be caused by a higher number of glances at the device in that condition. This study contributes to a better understanding of the distraction potential of smartwatches as well as identifying vocal assistants as the least distracting way of communicating while driving a vehicle. Industry leaders could become a key factor in informing the public of the smartwatch’s potential for distraction.}

abstract = {Objectives
To examine alleged drug-impaired driving in the province of Quebec (Canada), including drug use profile amongst suspected impaired drivers, prior to recreational cannabis legalization and major modifications to the legislation regarding driving under the influence of drugs (DUID).
Methods
The Laboratoire de sciences judiciaires et de médecine légale (LSJML) performs toxicological analyses on all biological samples collected during a Drug Evaluation and Classification Program (DECP) evaluation by a Drug Recognition Expert (DRE). A targeted analysis of 137 drugs and metabolites by liquid chromatography – tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) is systematically carried out, enhanced by gas chromatography – mass spectrometry (GC–MS) general unknown screening if deemed necessary. Data from all DECP cases analyzed from January 2014 to December 2018 was compiled and summarized.
Results
In the 5-year period studied, a total of 2 982 DECP cases underwent toxicological analysis. Age of the intercepted drivers varied between 14–82 years old (average 33 years old), with 79 % men and 21 % women. At least one substance with impairing potential was detected in 98 % of cases. In 89 % of cases (n = 2 640), at least one substance detected matched a category of drug suspected of causing impairment. At the other end of the spectrum, there were 270 cases (9%) where the findings did not match any of the categorie(s) suspected by the DRE, 66 negative cases (2%) and 6 incomplete evaluations. Substances most commonly detected belonged to the central nervous system (CNS) stimulants (72 %), CNS depressants (61 %) and cannabis (48 %) categories. Most prevalent substances were methamphetamine (54%), cannabis (11-nor-9-carboxy-tetrahydrocannabinol or THC−COOH, 48 %), cocaine (29 %) and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB, 24 %). Polydrug consumption was common, with two or more substances with impairing potential detected in 79 % of cases. There were 113 occurrences of new psychoactive substances (NPS), the most prevalent being rolicyclidine (PCPy, 47 %), methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV, 17 %), methylbenzylpiperazine (MBZP, 13 %) and flubromazolam (10 %). Drug prevalence patterns varied geographically, as well as with age and gender. Indeed, methamphetamine and GHB were more popular amongst women, whereas cannabis and cocaine were more prevalent amongst men. Cannabis and CNS stimulants were more common amongst younger drivers (14–34 years old); CNS depressants, dissociative anesthetics and non-psychoactive drugs prevalence increased with age.
Conclusions
An up-to-date database of DUID cases is a powerful tool in identifying trends and threats, focusing resources and orienting research and development activities. Such a database, combined with the data presented in the current study, will be key in evaluating the impact of new regulations, i.e., recreational cannabis legalization and modifications to the DUID legislation.}

As agencies begin to make decisions regarding investment in infrastructure and operation systems, it is imperative to understand the impacts these systems may have on safety. Past research has thoroughly investigated the impact of geometry and signal timing parameters on the safety of intersections, but little is understood on the relationship between improved signal performance and safety. This study uses vehicle trajectory data to create performance metrics for 121 signalized intersections on ten corridors near Columbus, Ohio. These metrics are used to understand the relationship between signal performance and safety. Two performance metrics, percent arrivals on green (POG) and level of travel time reliability (LOTTR), were used along with other volume and geometric data to model the total crash frequency on signalized mainline approaches. The crash data were modeled using a random parameters negative binomial approach. In consideration of potential unobserved heterogeneity between intersections, a correlated random parameters specification was tested alongside the traditional uncorrelated random parameters and fixed parameters model. Based on goodness of fit measures, the correlated random parameter model was chosen to interpret results because this model explains the complex cross-correlation among the estimates of random parameters. The elasticity values revealed a one percent increase in percent arrivals on green is associated with a reduction in total crashes by 1.12 %. The results of this study show the investment in signal operations and optimization result in an improvement in safety at signalized intersections. Further research should be explored to expand this study to additional intersections over a larger time period.}

For example, rear-end and side-swipe crashes are typically caused by improper vehicle interaction such as sudden lane-changing or speed control while hit-object crashes are likely the result of a single driver’s mistake. This study investigated the impact of vehicles travelling as a group (platoon) and its configuration (i.e., types of vehicles consisting of the platoon) on crash type and severity since the vehicles could affect each other when travelling in close proximity. This study applied Generalized Structure Equation Modeling (GSEM) to capture the complex relationships among the various crash factors such as traffic condition, driver characteristics, environmental conditions, and vehicle interaction to the crash attributes including type and severity. This study collected over 3 million individual vehicle data from 39 traffic count sites in California to estimate the vehicle interactions and driving behaviors. The microscopic traffic data are matched to 1417 crash reports. Results showed that vehicles traveling in platoons are associated with more rear-end and side-swipe crashes. Speed difference in the platoon had a positive effect on hit-object crashes if the platoon comprises vehicles of homogeneous type – either trucks or non-trucks. In addition, human factors such as age and gender were identified as significant influential factors in all type of crashes, however truck involvement particularly played an important role amongst side-swipe crashes. Crash severity was negatively affected by total flow, and rear-end crashes were more likely to be severe compared with hit-object crashes. Based on findings, this study suggests practical operational strategies to reduce traffic instability associated with platooned vehicle patterns. Understanding the high-risk factors for different crash types and severities would provide valuable insights for decision-makers and transportation engineers to develop targeted intervention strategies in consideration of road users and traffic conditions such as fleet mix and speed.}

Surrogates of crashes that would allow a quick and accurate estimation of safety have been an active topic for years. Among multiple alternatives, traffic conflicts have been established as a promising surrogate measure. This paper is aimed to demonstrate the validity of failure-caused traffic conflicts by applying a recently proposed Lomax-based method to estimate the expected number of crashes from observed traffic conflicts. The data collected in the naturalistic driving program, the Second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP2), were used in the validation task. The rear-end crashes recorded during the SHRP2 program and the corresponding rear-end traffic conflicts were analyzed for three categories of drivers: young male, mature male, and mature female. Past research has indicated that these three categories have a distinctively different proneness to involvement in crashes. Out of all rear-end traffic conflicts included in the SHRP2 database, 1.4 % were used to estimate the crash frequencies and rates for each studied type of driver. The Lomax distribution was applied within the counterfactual framework. Then, the conflict-based crash rate estimates were compared to the crash rates of the studied types of drivers calculated from all the rear-end crashes observed in the SHRP2 study period. The conflict-based rate estimates followed well the crash-based rates and the existing knowledge about the safety performance of the studied drivers. The conflict-based results confirmed the over-representation of young male drivers in crashes. It was also confirmed that mature male drivers are involved in rear-end crashes more frequently than mature female drivers. The results demonstrate both the validity of the Lomax-based analysis of failure-caused traffic conflicts and the benefit of traffic conflicts analysis that considerably reduces a period of data collection from years for crashes to days or weeks for traffic conflicts.}

To assess the effects of roadway characteristics or environmental factors on crash counts by severity level or by collision type, various models including multivariate Poisson regression models, multivariate negative binomial regression models, and multivariate Poisson-Lognormal regression models have been suggested. We introduce more general copula-based multivariate count regression models with correlated random effects within a Bayesian framework. Our models incorporate the dependence among the multivariate crash counts by modeling multivariate random effects using copulas. Copulas provide a flexible way to construct valid multivariate distributions by decomposing any joint distribution into a copula and the marginal distributions. Overdispersion as well as general correlation structures including both positive and negative correlations in multivariate crash counts can easily be accounted for by this approach. Our copular-based models can also encompass previously suggested multivariate count regression models including multivariate Poisson-Gamma mixture models and multivariate Poisson-Lognormal regression models. The proposed method is illustrated with crash count data of five different severity levels collected from 451 three-leg unsignalized intersections in California.}

Children and adult pedestrians with neurodevelopmental disorders may be at greater risk due to deficits in a range of domains, such as attention, social communication, motor control and executive function. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (American Psychological Association, 2013), neurodevelopmental disorders include individuals with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Specific Learning Disorder, Motor Difficulties, Communication Disorders and Intellectual Disabilities. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to explore existing literature relating to determine the nature of the risk faced by pedestrians with neurodevelopmental disorders. Relevant databases including Web of Science, PhysInfo and CINAHL were searched up to July 2019. All peer reviewed journals that presented data focusing on neurodevelopmental disorders and some aspect of road crossing or roadside behaviour that included a control or comparison group were included. A total of 149 abstracts were assessed and 17 met the inclusion criteria. The identified papers could be grouped into four areas: (1) rate of injury; (2) assessment of risk; (3) eye gaze and understanding of road layout and (4) gap choice. No papers exploring the risk factors at the roadside for individuals with Specific Learning Disorders or Communication Disorders were identified. Overall, the review provide evidence for an elevated risk of injury for individuals with ADHD at the roadside, potentially as a consequence of poor temporal gap choice, although there was evidence that this risk could be mediated by executive dysfunction rather than ADHD symptomology. Furthermore, poor temporal gap choice was found in children with DCD but it remains unclear as to whether this risk translates to the roadside. Finally, both children and adults with ASD and children with ID were found to demonstrate differences in behaviour / understanding at the roadside. In general, co-occurrence between neurodevelopmental disorders has been largely ignored in the current literature relating to pedestrian risk and future research could consider this along with executive functioning.}

abstract = {The demonstration, showcase, and city studies of autonomous vehicles (AVs) provide valuable opportunities for the public to interact with AV. Understanding the relationship between experiencing and intention to use AV is crucial because first-hand experience shapes an individual’s initial impressions on autonomous driving. This study investigated the users’ intention to use AVs based on extended theory of planned behavior, which incorporated experience satisfaction and trust. The data were collected through a field experiment from 117 respondents who had experienced a SAE Level 4 autonomous minibus in China. The proposed relationships were examined using partial least squares structural equation modelling. A satisfied experience contributes to a higher degree of trust, attitude, subjective norm (SN), and perceived behavioral control (PBC). Excluding SN, results suggest that attitude, PBC, experience satisfaction, and trust, are statistically proven to affect the intention to use AV. Moreover, an examination of individual difference reflects that the impact of experience satisfaction on PBC varies distinctively in male and female group, as well as in less educated and more educated group. Findings show the theoretical contributions and practical implications on the role of initial experience of AV acceptance.}

Drivers text while driving despite being aware of the risks. Although some factors related to the decision to text while driving have been elucidated, more remains to be investigated in order to better predict and prevent texting while driving. To study decision making involved in reading a text message while driving, we conducted a discrete choice experiment with 345 adult participants recruited from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. Participants were presented with multiple choice sets, each involving two different scenarios, and asked to choose the scenario in which they would be more likely to text while driving. The attributes of the scenarios were the relationship to the text-message sender, the road conditions, and the importance of the message. The attributes varied systematically across the choice sets. Participants were more likely to read a text message while driving if the sender of the message was a significant other, the message was perceived to be very important, and the participant was driving on rural roads. Discrete choice experiments offer a promising approach to studying decision making in drivers and other populations because they allow for an analysis of multiple factors simultaneously and the trade-offs among different choices.}

Most of the previous intersection safety studies are conducted based on static and highly aggregated data such as average daily traffic and crash frequency. The aggregated data may result in unreliable findings because they are based on averages and might not necessarily represent the actual conditions at the time of the crash. This study uses real-time event-based detection records, and crash data to develop predictive models for the vehicle occupants' injury severity. The three-year (2017–2019) data were acquired from the arterial highways in the City of Tallahassee, Florida. Random Forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifiers were used to identify the important factors on the vehicle occupants' injury severity prediction. The performance comparison of the two classifiers revealed that the XGBoost has a higher balanced accuracy score than RF. Using the XGBoost classifier, five topmost influential factors on injury prediction were identified. The factors are the manner of the collision, through and right-turn traffic volume, arrival on red for through and right-turn traffic, split failure for through traffic, and delays for through and right-turn traffic. Moreover, the partial dependency plots of the influential variables are presented to reveal their impact on vehicle occupant injury prediction. The knowledge gained from this study will be useful in developing effective proactive countermeasures to mitigate intersection-related crash injuries in real-time.}

Sixty learner drivers and sixty experienced drivers sat either a hazard-perception version of this test (requiring timed responses to materialized hazards) or a hazard-prediction variant of the test (where the screen is occluded as the hazard begins to appear and drivers are asked ‘What happens next?’). Recent studies have demonstrated that the prediction test format outperforms the hazard perception format using naturalistic video, but there has not yet been a study replicating this effect with computer-animated materials similar to the quality of those used in the official UK hazard perception test. The new test also included eleven theory questions designed to probe drivers’ knowledge of the rules of the road. The results demonstrated that both test variants differentiated between driver groups with considerable effect sizes. Theory-question scores were comparable across learner and experienced driver groups, reflecting learners’ preparation for the test and possible issues with memory decay and overwriting in the experienced group. As an interesting aside, driving-related video game play negatively correlated with hazard perception performance, but not with hazard prediction scores. Some individual hazards better suited the prediction or perception test format, raising the possibility of a future hybrid test that combines the two approaches.}

Whole-body kinematics as well as vehicle and ground contact related aHIC (approximate HIC) and BrIC scores were evaluated. Reasonable results were generally achieved for the timings of the principal collision events, and for the overall ground contact mechanisms. However, the resulting head injury predictions based on the ground contact HIC and BrIC scores showed limited capacity of the model to replicate individual experiments. Sensitivity studies showed substantial influences of the vehicle-pedestrian contact characteristic and certain initial pedestrian joint angles on the subsequent ground contact kinematics and injury predictions. Further work is needed to improve the predictive capacity of the MADYMO pedestrian model for ground contact injury predictions.}

Previous studies investigated the grouping of individual observations between different clusters by considering a single random factor at level-2 of data structure. This approach, however, hinders exploring the possible crossed effects of additional random factors at the level-2 of data hierarchy on the response variable. The current study aims to expand the previous attempts by introducing the concept of Cross-Classified Random Effects Modeling (CCREM) and utilizing crossed random intercepts to account for the crossed effects of two random factors. Aligned with the Connected Vehicle Pilot Deployment Program on Interstate-80 (I-80), this paper intends to cluster critical crashes, involving fatal or incapacitating injuries, versus non-critical crashes through a 402-mile I-80 in Wyoming during the first five months of 2017. Aggregated environmental conditions were conflated with disaggregated real-time traffic observations. Concerning road surface conditions and longitudinal grade categories, four Logistic Regression models were calibrated under Bayesian Inference. Model-1 considered these two factors as fixed parameters; however, in each of Model-2 and Model-3, one of these factors was treated as a random intercept. Model-4 considered both factors as random intercepts and investigated their crossed effect on the critical crash probability. Model-4 outperformed the others and showed that the maximum probability of critical crashes arises on dry pavements and steep downgrades. In contrast, the combined effect of wet pavements and less steep downgrades is associated with the minimum risk of critical crashes. It was revealed that the probability of critical crashes varies at any given value of real-time traffic-related predictors according to different combinations of longitudinal grade and road surface conditions. This finding indicates an essential need for Active Traffic Management to timely apply interventions not only based on real-time traffic-related predictors but also according to various combinations of environmental conditions.}

Frequent and improper lane changing has a substantial effect on both traffic operations and safety. This study investigates the factors that contribute to the injury severity of crashes resulting from improper lane change maneuvers involving younger and older drivers in Alabama. Crash data for the study was obtained from the Critical Analysis Reporting Environment (CARE) system developed by the Center for Advanced Public Safety at the University of Alabama. Preliminary data analysis showed that younger drivers were responsible for about 63.1 % of the crashes. Random logit with heterogeneity in means models were developed to identify significant crash factors that were associated with the crash outcomes. The results show that younger male drivers were more likely to be severely injured in lane changing crashes whereas older male drivers were less likely to be severely injured. The results further show that younger drivers were more likely to sustain a major injury on six-lane highways whereas older drivers sustained major injuries from overtaking maneuvers on two-lane highways. It was further found that while younger drivers got into major injury crashes under daylight conditions, older drivers were more likely to be involved in major injury crashes under dark/unlit lighting conditions. Improper lane changing constitutes some form of aggressive driving which needs to be addressed considering that many lives are lost annually from the practice. The findings from this study may be used by road safety advocates and practitioners to identify what and how to target crash countermeasures to the younger and older driver population groups in the state.}

This study focuses on characterizing the sequential crash generating process of the interactions between traffic flow conditions, roadway attributes, driver behavior, event attributes, and precipitating events in FRE crashes. A sequential modeling framework for modeling the sequential and combined effects on FRE crash risk was constructed by applying structural equation modeling (SEM). The Second Highway Strategic Research Program (SHRP2) Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) data was utilized for this purpose as this data provides extensive information concerning what happened before crashes and near-crashes. A total of 17 and 433 FRE crashes and near-crashes, respectively, were included in this study. It was found that (1) FRE crashes were associated with the sequential and combined effects of those factors above; (2) certain types of speed oscillations were identified as precursors to sudden braking when vehicles ahead decelerated or stopped-and-went; and (3) many factors were identified as being associated with driver perception time and crash occurrence.}

abstract = {Purpose
Safety climate, which is defined as workers’ shared perceptions of organizational policies, procedures, and practices as they relate to the true or relative value and importance of safety within an organization, is one of the best indicators of organizational safety outcomes. This study identifies key drivers of safety climate from the perspective of leader-member exchange (LMX). LMX is a theory describing the nature and processes of social interactions between a supervisor and a subordinate. This study examines the impact of individual drivers and combinations of drivers on safety climate through Bayesian Network simulations to predict practices which most effectively improve safety climate in the trucking industry.
Method
Survey data were collected from 5083 truck drivers in a large U.S. trucking company. Bayesian Network analysis was used to identify key drivers (factors) of safety climate and the best joint strategies for improvement. The impact of the drivers on safety climate was assessed and the simulation identified their potential impact independently and in concert with other drivers.
Results
The results from Bayesian Network analyses showed that the effects of LMX on organization- and group-level safety climate were conditionally dependent on four other drivers including psychological ownership, supervisory integrity, situation awareness, and safety communication. Among the five contributing factors, supervisory integrity and LMX had the strongest independent effects on organization- and group-level safety climate. Moreover, the results indicated that the best two joint strategies for promoting organizational (company/top management level) safety climate were LMX and psychological ownership as well as LMX and situation awareness, whereas the best two joint strategies for improving group (workgroup/supervisor level) safety climate were joint optimization of LMX and safety communication as well as LMX and psychological ownership.
Implications
Based on the study results, the strategies that may have the most potential to improve trucking safety climate are: enhancing leaders' ability to engage in high-quality exchanges (e.g., caring about employees), developing training to encourage employees/leaders to deliver on promises, and providing employees with more autonomy to enhance their ownership.}

Whilst studies have shown that whiplash-reducing head restraint systems are highly effective in reducing whiplash injury, these were based on a limited range of systems including Toyota’s Whiplash Injury Lessening (WIL) seating system, Volvo’s Whiplash Injury Prevention System (WHIPS) and the Saab Active Head Restraint (SAHR) and have generally focussed on Swedish crash and insurance data. However, there has been no broad real-world crash-based evaluation of the effectiveness of whiplash-reducing head restraint systems currently present in the vehicle fleet that validates the results of these studies in other populations. The objective of this study was to undertake a retrospective evaluation of vehicle whiplash-reducing head restraint systems to prevent whiplash injury using real-world crash data linked to insurance claims data in Victoria, Australia. It was found that whiplash-reducing head restraint systems are associated with a statistically significant reduction in the odds of driver and front seat passenger whiplash injury in a vehicle struck in a rear-end collision of 11.6 % (95 % CI 0.20 %, 21.6 %). The results indicate that whiplash-reducing head restraint systems are an effective technology for reducing the risk of whiplash injury to drivers and front seat passengers in a vehicle struck in a rear-end collision. Considering that around a quarter of all casualty crashes involving passenger and light commercial vehicles are rear-end, the fitment of whiplash-reducing head restraint systems to all vehicles as a standard safety feature would likely see a significant reduction in the incidence of whiplash injury.}

To establish countermeasures to avoid collisions, it is necessary to understand driver’s responses in such critical situations. From videos of drive recorders, the behavior of cyclists and drivers that led to car-to-cyclist collisions can be analyzed objectively. In this research, the drivers’ responses to avoid car-to-cyclist perpendicular collisions were examined using videos of drive recorders, and through using a driving simulator. First, drivers’ responses to avoid collisions were compared between near-miss incidents and actual collisions using videos from drive recorders. In a statistical analysis of selected parameters of the drivers’ responses, the average values of different parameters such as the time-to-collision (TTC), the deceleration at the time the cyclist was first visible to the driver, and the braking reaction time (BRT) were significantly different between near-miss incidents and collisions. Applying logistic regression to the near-miss and collision data revealed that the BRT at the time the cyclist was first visible had the largest influence on collision occurrences. The velocity-TTC, and the velocity-distance graphs at the time of braking-onset was plotted; the car deceleration of 5.2 m/s2 was the threshold which discriminated near-miss and collisions. Second, the responses of people to avoid collisions against cyclists were investigated in a driving simulator. Based on real-world collision videos from the drive recorders, two scenarios were reconstructed where the crossing cyclist appeared suddenly from behind view-blocking obstructions at an intersection. Scenario A has a relatively large TTC of 1.9 s, and scenario B had a small TTC of 0.5 s. The BRT was significantly smaller in the group that avoided collisions than in the group that collisions occurred in scenario A, whereas all parameters (TTC, BRT, and car deceleration) were all significantly smaller in the group that avoided collision in scenario B. The driver response parameters (TTC, BRT and car deceleration) were comparable between the drive recorder data and the driving simulator experiments. It was demonstrated that the BRT is the most important parameter toward avoiding collisions. Some drivers who accelerated the cars at the intersections had large BRT, and this led to collisions. Additionally, it was observed that swerving of cars without braking was not effective for collision avoidance.}

This paper investigates the national influence on cyclist casualty severity at roundabouts by comparing the United Kingdom (using Northumbria as a representative sample) and Belgium. The data included speed limits, socio-demographic characteristics, environmental conditions and driver/cyclist behaviour-related contributory factors. First, a logistic regression analysis for the UK data, including 864 cyclist casualties, was carried out. Increasing the speed limit by ten units (for example 30mph to 40mph) increased the probability of a cyclist being killed or seriously injured by 10%. A cyclist casualty was more than three times more likely to be killed or seriously injured (the odds ratio is 3.02) where sudden braking was recorded as a contributory factor. Second, a separate logistic regression analysis for Belgium was conducted. Cyclists ignoring the priority at roundabouts increased the probability of a fatal or seriously injured collisions (the odds ratio is 2.71). Comparing the individual analysis for both countries, the influence of cyclist age was consistent. Each one-year increase in cyclist age increases chance of being killed or seriously injured as opposed to not being killed or seriously injured by 2 % (odds ratio is 1.02) in both UK and Belgium. A final comparative analysis was applied considering proxy variables for both countries. Three-way chi-square tests of independence showed that all non-behavioural variables (i.e. sociodemographic characteristics, speed limit, and environmental conditions) were found to be statistically different between UK and Belgium for both slight and killed and seriously injured casualties. This suggests that driver/cyclist interaction and behaviour in the two countries is generally similar whilst speed limits, the sociodemographic characteristics of cyclists and environmental conditions are specific for each country. The third part of the logistic regression analysis suggested that the country residual was highly statistically significant. This indicates that there are some statistically significant differences with respect to the characteristics of the two regional datasets used in the analysis.}

A better understanding of driver-roadway interaction can enhance road design to create a safer traffic system. In this context, driving simulators are powerful tools that combine convenience and effectiveness in identifying drivers' responses to different geometry factors. In this paper, a systematic review following a Prisma guideline was conducted on driving simulator studies that examined the effects of road geometry on driver behaviour to reveal the current procedures adopted in this field and their main findings. A systematic search of eleven databases was performed covering six years of research results. Inclusion of relevant studies focused on horizontal curves, a topic identified as the most cited, extended this period. The results revealed significant heterogeneity in relation to the measured variables and deficiencies when reporting the experiment, which prevented a meta-analysis of the studies' outcomes. Despite this, a discussion of the potential of driving simulators to contribute to several road safety research gaps is presented. In addition, problems of a lack of standardisation in the performance of the experiments were detected, potentially influencing the findings of the studies. However, the results also suggest that experiments that followed good experimental practices observed effects on driver performances not detected by other studies.}

abstract = {Thorough evaluations on injury risk (IR) are fundamental for guiding interventions toward the enhancement of both the road infrastructure and the active/passive safety of vehicles. Well-established estimates are currently based on IR functions modeled on post-crash variables, such as velocity change sustained by the vehicle (ΔV); thence, these analyses do not directly suggest how pre-crash conditions can be modified to allow for IR reduction. Nevertheless, ΔV can be disaggregated into two contributions which enable its a priori calculation, based only on the information available at the impact instant: the Crash Momentum Index (CMI), representing impact eccentricity at collision, and the closing velocity at collision (Vr). By extensively employing the CMI indicator, this work assesses the overall influence of impact eccentricity and closing velocity on the risk for occupants to sustain a serious injury. As CMI synthesizes indications regarding ΔV, its use can be disjointed from the ΔV itself for the derivation of high-quality IR models. This feature distinguishes CMI from the other eccentricity indicators available at the state-of-the-art, allowing for the contribution of eccentricity on IR to be completely isolated. Because of this element of originality, special attention is given to the CMI variable throughout the present work. Based on data extracted from the NASS/CDS database, the influence of the CMI and Vr variables on IR is specifically highlighted and analyzed from several perspectives. The feature ranking algorithm ReliefF, whose use is unprecedented in the accident analysis field, is first employed to assess importance of such impact-related variables in determining the injury outcome: if compared to vehicle-related and occupant-related variables (as category and age, respectively), the higher influence of CMI and Vr is initially highlighted. Secondly, the relevance of CMI and Vr is confirmed by fitting different predictive models: the fitted models which include the CMI predictor perform better than models which neglect the CMI, in terms of classical evaluation metrics. As a whole, considering the high predictive power of the proposed CMI-based models, this work provides valuable tools for the a priori assessment of IR.}

abstract = {We examined the effects of different types of cognitive distraction coming from a hands-free phone conversation on the processing of information provided by variable message signs (VMS), on driving performance indicators, and on a physiological index of mental effort (heart rate). Participants drove a route in a driving simulator and had to respond to VMS messages under three conditions: no-distraction, visuospatial distraction (attending phone calls with questions inducing visuospatial processing), and conceptual distraction (attending phone calls with questions requiring semantic memory). Results showed more errors responding to VMS messages in the visuospatial distraction condition. In addition, both types of questions increased the intraindividual variability of response distances and the heart rate, as compared to the no-distraction condition. These results provide new evidence that talking on a hands-free phone entails costs in the processing of traffic information (in particular, text messages displayed on VMS) and it increases the driver’s cognitive effort. Interestingly, the cognitive distraction had no effect on the driver’s control of the vehicle speed or lateral position. Therefore, the effects of potential risk factors can critically vary among the different driving subtasks due to modulatory factors, such as the level of attentional task demands (relatively high in the processing of messages on VMS, but relatively low in controlling the speed and lateral position of the vehicle in quiet traffic conditions). In consequence, the current paper provides new evidence to discuss hands-free phone policies and highlights the importance of designing technological countermeasures to prevent drivers missing critical information displayed on VMS.}

abstract = {Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) offer a huge potential to improve the operations and safety of transportation systems. However, the use of smart devices and communications in CAVs introduce new risks. CAVs would leverage vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communication, thus providing additional system access points compared to traditional systems. Automation makes these systems more vulnerable and increases the consequences of cyberattacks. This study utilizes an infrastructure-based communication platform consisting of cooperative adaptive cruise control and lane control advisories developed by the authors to perform cyber risk assessment of CAVs. The study emulates three types of cyberattacks (message falsification, dedicated denial of service, and spoofing attacks) in a representative traffic environment consisting of multiple CAV platoons and lane change events to analyze the safety and stability impacts of the cyberattacks. Simulation experiments using VISSIM reveals that traffic stream and CAV string is unstable under all three types of cyberattacks. The worst case is represented by the message falsification attack. Increases in volatility are observed over a no attack case, with variations increasing by an average of 43%–51% along with an increase of over 3000 crash conflicts. Similarly, lane change crash conflicts are observed to be more severe compared to rear end crash conflicts, showing a higher probability of severe injuries. Further, the case of slight cyberattack on a single CAV also creates significant disruption in the traffic stream. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) reveals the statistical significance of the results. These results pave the way for future design of secure systems from a monitoring perspective.}

abstract = {Automatic incident detection (AID) systems and variable speed limits (VSLs) can reduce crash probability and traffic congestion. Studies based on loop detector data have shown that AID systems decrease the variation in speeds between drivers. Despite the impact on driver behaviour characteristics, most mathematical models evaluating the effect of AID systems on traffic operations do not capture driver response realistically. This study examines the main factors related to driver speed compliance with a sequence of three VSLs triggered by an AID system. For this purpose, the variable speed limit database of the executive agency of the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management (Rijkswaterstaat) was integrated into the UDRIVE naturalistic driving database for passenger car data collected in the Netherlands. The video data were annotated to analyse driver glance behaviour and secondary task engagement. A logistic regression model was estimated to predict driver speed compliance after each VSL in the sequence. The results reveal that the factors predicting compliance to the VSLs differ based on which of the three VSLs the driver is subjected to. Low speeds and accelerations before the gantry, approaching a slower leader, high proportion of time with eyes-on-road and close consecutive gantries were associated with high compliance with the first VSL in the sequence (i.e., indicating a speed limit of 70 km/h with flashing attention lights). Low speeds and accelerations before the gantry, close consecutive gantries and a small number of lanes resulted in high compliance with the second VSL (i.e., a speed limit of 50 km/h with flashing attention lights). Low speeds before the gantry and close consecutive gantries were linked to high compliance with the third VSL (i.e., indicating a speed limit of 50 km/h). Although further investigations based on a larger sample are needed, these findings are relevant to the development of human-like driving assistance systems and of traffic simulations that assess the impact of AID systems on traffic operations realistically.}

abstract = {By handling conflicting traffic movements and establishing dynamic coordination between intersections in real-time, the Adaptive Signal Control System (ASCS) can potentially improve the operation and safety of signalized intersections on a corridor. This study identifies the hierarchical effects of ASCS on the crash severity by exploring the heterogeneous effect of ASCS on the crash severity. Four different random-parameter ordered regression models (two ordered probit models, and two ordered logit models) are developed and compared. The analysis reveals that the random-parameter ordered probit and logit models (ROP and ROL) with observed heterogeneity perform better than the random-parameter ordered probit and logit models (RP and RL) without observed heterogeneity in terms of the Akaike information criteria and the goodness of fit of the model. The ROP model performs better than the ROL model in terms of classification model performance measures. The ROP model enables parameters (i.e., the coefficients of the explanatory variables) to vary as a function of explanatory variables as well as across observations, thus accounting for both observed (captured by available explanatory variables) and unobserved (not captured by available explanatory variables) heterogeneity. The analysis reveals that the presence of ASCS is associated with lower crash severity. In this study, observed heterogeneity of ASCS effects on the crash severity is captured by variables related to the intersection and corridor features. Other contributing factors besides ASCS, such as annual average daily traffic, speed limit, lighting, peak period, crash type (rear-end, angle), and pedestrian involvements, are also associated with the probability of crash severity. Unobserved heterogeneity of the effect of angle crash type on the crash severity is found to exist across the observations. The findings of this research have practical implications for establishing ASCS implementation guidelines in lowering the probability of higher crash severity.}

These anticipated benefits can only be realized if this technology is accepted and thus used by older adults.

This study investigated the extent to which older adults’ acceptance of fully automated vehicles are affected by exposure to automated vehicle technology (pre- vs. post-exposure), driving style (manual style relative to automated style), driving conditions (clear, rain, traffic), and age. Thirty-six older adults (M = 73.25, SD = 5.96) completed non-automated (manual) and fully automated driving scenarios under different driving conditions in a high-fidelity driving simulator. The fully automated driving scenarios were designed to be reliably driven by the system in a conservative driving style. Driving conditions included clear daytime, rain, and high-traffic. Pre- and post-exposure to the simulated fully automated driving experience, participants rated their comfort level with fully automated vehicles (FAVs). Additionally, after each driving condition, participants answered a validated questionnaire on their acceptance of the simulated fully automated experience for each respective driving condition. Age and driving style were found to have a significant effect on older adults’ acceptance of FAVs, with older age and greater dissimilarity of an individual’s manual driving style from the FAV’s driving style being associated with lower acceptance. The results suggest that if reliability of fully automated vehicles is ultimately ensured and is demonstrated to the older adults, their acceptance of fully automated vehicles is generally high, particularly if the FAV is operated in a style similar to their own.}

Eight hundred and fifty-three young drivers aged 17–25 years (M age = 19.89; 74 % female) completed an online questionnaire which included measures of the five-facet model of impulsivity, mobile phone involvement, and MWD (initiating, monitoring/reading, and responding to social communications). Of impulsivity facets, lower premeditation and higher positive urgency significantly predicted each MWD behaviour, while higher sensation seeking significantly predicted responding only, providing some support for differential relationships of impulsivity facets with MWD. Mobile phone involvement was a more robust predictor of MWD. Moreover, there were significant indirect effects of positive and negative urgency via mobile phone involvement for all three MWD behaviours. Findings highlight the importance of mobile phone involvement for explaining MWD which should be addressed in future studies.}

The tunnel retro-reflective arch (TA) plays a crucial role in stimulating drivers, relieving visual stress, and improving safety. However, determining the TA spacing mostly relies on experience and relevant standards are lacking. The aim of this research was to evaluate the degree of influence of the TA on driver behavior, visual aspects, and psychology in different zones (overall tunnel, curved segment, and middle segment) of extra-long tunnels. To test the influence of TAs, four scenarios were constructed, including three alternatives with different TA spacings (200, 300, and 400 m), and one no-arch design as a control alternative. Based on a driving simulator, the evaluation indicators related to driving safety, smoothness, and handling stability were selected and analyzed. We acquired data every 50 m as an analytical unit. The results show that the TA significantly affects driver behavior, visual aspects, and psychology. According to the matter-element model result, setting the TA spacing to 300 m in curved segment and in the tunnel overall is the best option. In the middle segment, the setting spacing of 400 m is ideal.}

abstract = {Transition zones are a road section where posted speed drops from higher to lower limits. Due to the sudden changes in posted speed limits and road environment, drivers usually do not adapt to the posted speed limits and underestimate their traveling speed. Previous studies have highlighted that crash rates are usually higher in these sections. This study aims at improving the safety at transition zones by introducing perceptual measures that are tested using a driving simulator. The proposed measures are speed limit pavement markings with a gradual increase of brightness and/or size that were placed at transition zones in simulation scenarios replicating the real-world environment of the Doha Expressway in Qatar. These innovative measures aim to produce the impression of increased speed that could stimulate drivers to better adapt speed limits. The driving behavior of 81 drivers possessing a valid Qatari driving license was recorded with a driving simulator interfaced with STISIM Drive® 3. Results showed that pavement markings combining size and brightness manipulations were the most effective treatment, keeping drivers' traveling speed significantly below the traveling speed recorded in the untreated control condition. In this regard, the maximum mean speed reductions of 5.3 km/h and 4.6 km/h were observed for this treatment at the first transition (120 to 100 km/h) and second transition (100 to 80 km/h) zones, respectively. Regarding the variations in drivers' lateral position, the results showed that the proposed pavement markings did not negatively influence drivers' lateral control on the road as the maximum observed standard deviation of lateral position was around 0.065 m. This study shows that the proposed pavement markings are recommended for improving the speed adaptation of drivers in the transition zones.}

Though researchers showed increasing interest in driving strategies, there still has no comprehensive answer on how to proactively implement safe driving. After analyzing several representative driving strategies, we propose three characteristic dimensions that are important to measure driving strategies: preferred objective, risk appetite, and collaborative manner. According to these three characteristic dimensions, we categorize existing driving strategies of autonomous vehicles into four kinds: defensive driving strategies, competitive driving strategies, negotiated driving strategies, and cooperative driving strategies. This paper provides a timely comparative review of these four strategies and highlights the possible directions for improving the high-level driving strategy design.}

abstract = {Introduction
As part of the transformation of urban transportation dynamics, commuter cycling has acquired a high relevance as an alternative mode of transport in different countries, and Latin America seems to be one of the main focus of this worldwide “revolution”. However, the high rates of crashes and injuries suffered by commuters have become a relevant issue in the field of road safety, especially in emerging regions with low cycling tradition, where social and infrastructural gaps may endanger the cyclists’ safety.
Objectives
This study had two objectives. First, to compare key safe cycling-related variables between cycling commuters and non-commuters; and second, to differentially asses the effect of individual and cycling-related variables on their self-reported crash rates. Method: For this cross-sectional research, the data provided by 577 Latin American urban cyclists from three countries (Argentina, Colombia and Mexico) with a mean age of 32.7 years was used. They answered a questionnaire on cycling habits, risk perception, rule knowledge, cycling behaviors and riding crashes.
Results
The outcomes of this study showed that, despite having a higher risk perception, cycling commuters perform deliberate risky cycling behaviors (traffic violations) more frequently, and they suffer more crashes; cycling commuters report higher rates of psychological distress, and a lower degree of rule knowledge and protective behaviors than non-commuters. Furthermore, structural similarities and differences in the explanation of cycling crashes were found across commuters and non-commuters.
Conclusion
The results of this study suggest that non-commuters, whose purposes for cycling are more aimed at leisure and occasional trips, perform less risky behaviors but suffer more cycling distractions, whereas commuters are comparatively more exposed to behavioral-based safety risks, and suffer more frequent crashes. Since recent evidence forecasts that urban cycling will keep growing in Latin American cities, it is necessary to implement policies and educational/training improvements that may enhance the safety and health of cyclists in these countries.}

To investigate the frequency of such mistakes, a case study was conducted with pedestrians in Hong Kong, which follows LD rules, i.e., traffic drives on the left. The study aimed to probe the effects of hometown driving rules and length of stay on pedestrians’ right-looking habit and maladaptation to the Hong Kong LD system and determine the mediating effect of the right-looking habit. A face-to-face survey was conducted with 581 respondents at seven locations in Hong Kong. A structural equation model was applied to determine the relationship among hometown driving rules, length of stay, right-looking habit, and maladaptation. The model exhibited good fitness (χ2/degrees of freedom=2.154; comparative fit index=0.989; Tucker-Lewis Index=0.980; and root mean square error of approximation=0.045). The results revealed that hometown driving rules and length of stay had positive effects on the right-looking habit, and hometown driving rules had a direct negative effect on maladaptation. The right-looking habit partially mediated the effect of hometown driving rules and fully mediated the effect of length of stay on maladaptation to the Hong Kong LD system. It was found that when foreign pedestrians were in areas with unfamiliar driving rules, they tended to practice their hometown looking habits, especially foreign pedestrians who had stayed only for a short time; this behavior differed significantly from that of local pedestrians, and it led to more severe maladaptation. The findings of this study provide empirical evidence of pedestrians’ looking habits and maladaptation in areas with unfamiliar driving systems and have significant implications for improving the safety of foreign pedestrians.}

The accidents were reconstructed through an optimal fit method, based on kinematic and medical information. After the reconstruction, a parametric study on cyclists’ movement and accident conditions was performed on the different cases. The velocity of the car and the angle of impact were found to significantly affect the accident outcome. This was demonstrated in terms of head injury criteria such as the Head Injury Criterion (HIC), the peak linear and peak angular velocity and acceleration. It was shown that the severity of the injury increases exponentially with increasing collision velocities. Additionally, the bicycle’s parameters; crank rotation, handlebar angle and seat position revealed a large heterogeneity in the results. The maximum alteration between the lowest and highest HIC-value found for a complete crank rotation was a 416 % difference. For a handlebar rotation up to 100° or seat height alteration of maximum 34 cm, this value was respectively 169 % and 294 %. These high percentages of change indicate the need for cycling phase information for case-specific vehicle-bicycle accident reconstructions.}

This paper reports on research that analyzed the real-time tire force data (kinetic response) obtained from vehicle kinetic experiments, and constructed a new approach for identifying the high-risk of crashes on freeway segments with horizontal curvature. First, the road was divided into 1km units. Then, taking into account the characteristics of freeway alignment, each segment with horizontal curve was selected as the object of subsequent analysis. Automotive instrumentation was used to obtain a measure of tire force in the course of normal driving. The entire data set was preprocessed according to rate of change and the density of the data was reduced. By defining the outliers of the kinetic data and conducting factor analysis, two representative crash risk indicators of longitudinal and lateral stability were obtained. Negative binomial regression model (NBR model) and random effects negative binomial regression model (RENBR model) were constructed and jointly applied based on the new indicators to predict the risk value of horizontal curve segments. The method showed good prediction performance (71.8 %) for high-risk road segments with design flaws, but the predicted effect for low-risk road segments was not ideal. This study not only illustrated the effectiveness of in-vehicle data in assessing road crash risk by coupling multiple kinetic parameters, but also provided support for freeway safety research using surrogate measures of risk when there is a lack of crash statistics.}

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a seat-integrated mobilization system for maintaining vigilance under monotonous driving situations.
Method
For this purpose, vigilance indicators were compared intra-individually in a test condition with mobilization (seat-integrated stimulation) and a placebo condition under standardized conditions in a real driving study (N = 31). During a monotonous two-hour ride, physiological (brain activity by the EEG alpha spindle rate), performance-based (reaction times) and subjective indicators were recorded.
Results
The necessary precondition for the paradigm of inducing fatigue through monotony was confirmed by a significant increase in the EEG alpha spindle rate and the subjective vigilance indices. The mobilization system had a significant impact on the most fatigue-sensitive parameter of the alpha spindle rate, whereas the other parameters of vigilance did not reflect a significant effect of mobilization.
Conclusion
The Mobilization Seat is an effective measure to prevent drivers’ fatigue during monotonous situations.}

abstract = {Purpose
The current study examined how wearing a heavy backpack influences children’s street crossing behaviors.
Method
Using a fully-immersive virtual reality system, numerous indices of children’s street crossing behaviors (7−13 years) were measured both when wearing a heavy backpack (12% of bodyweight) and when not doing so.
Results
A heavy backpack slowed walking speed. However, any potential increase in risk from this was counteracted by compensatory actions that included: the selection of larger inter-vehicle gaps to cross into; greater efficiency in initiating the crossing (reduced start delay); and increased walking speed when in the path of the approaching vehicle. Ultimately, there was no greater risk outcome (time left to spare) compared to children’s performance when not wearing a backpack. There were no age or sex differences.
Conclusion
When tested in ways that preserve perceptual-motor coupling in traffic situations, children strategically responded to maintain their safety despite wearing a heavy backpack that slowed their walking speed. Previous conclusions that a backpack increases pedestrian injury risk is likely an artifact of the testing method used.}

This study aimed to develop effective approaches for predicting at-fault crash driver frequency using only city-level traffic enforcement predictors. A fusion deep learning approach combining a convolution neural network (CNN) and gated recurrent units (GRU) was developed to compare predictive performance with one econometric approach, two machine learning approaches, and another deep learning approach. The performance comparison was conducted for (1) at-fault crash driver frequency prediction tasks and (2) city-level crash risk prediction tasks. The proposed CNN-GRU achieved remarkable prediction accuracy and outperformed other approaches, while the other approaches also exhibited excellent performances. The results suggest that effective prediction approaches and appropriate traffic safety measures can be developed by considering both crash frequency and crash risk prediction tasks. In addition, the accumulated local effects (ALE) plot was utilized to investigate the contribution of each traffic enforcement activity on traffic safety in a scenario of multicollinearity among predictors. The ALE plot illustrated a complex nonlinear relationship between traffic enforcement predictors and the response variable. These findings can facilitate the development of traffic safety measures and serve as a good foundation for further investigations and utilization of traffic violation data.}

Data were collected, using two-wheelers equipped with accelerometers and GPS. Personality factors – sensation seeking and risk taking - were measured with surveys. Regular commuters used one of the three bicycle types for two weeks. Participant bias was intentionally included by allowing participants to select a bicycle type of their preference, resulting in 12 conventional bicycle riders (71 % women), 14 pedelec riders (67 % women) and 20 s-pedelec riders (25 % women). S-pedelecs were much faster than conventional bicycles, amounting to a speed difference with conventional bicycles of 10.4 km/h in urban areas (M =28.2 km/h vs. 17.8 km/h) and of 13.2 km/h in rural areas (M = 31.4 km/h vs. 18.2 km/h). The speed differences between pedelecs and conventional bicycles were much smaller: 2.3 km/h in urban areas (20.1 km/h vs 17.8 km/h) and 4 km/h in rural areas (22.2 km/h vs. 18.2 km/h). Compared to conventional bicycles, s-pedelecs varied their speed to a greater extent and also braked harshly more frequently, showing a greater need for speed adjustment. These adjustments were larger at higher speeds. In contrast, pedelecs did not differ from conventional bicycles on speed variation. MSAL for s-pedelec riders differed by gender. For men the MSAL was 87 % on urban sections and 91 % on rural sections. For women, the MSAL was lower, respectively 23 and 69 %. None of the personality factors were associated with speed variability, harsh braking or MSAL. However, sensation seeking was associated with higher mean speeds on all three bicycle types. To conclude, pedelecs and conventional bicycles are similar in speed patterns, whereas the speed patterns of s-pedelecs differ significantly from the former two. The safety implications are discussed.}

In total, 21 studies were located that met inclusion criteria for the review. The range of sensitivity outcomes was between 39.0–98.8 % and between 73.0–98.9 % for specificity outcomes. There was considerable variation in the outcomes of the studies employing only one physiological measure (mono-signal approach), whereas, a poly-signal approach with multiple physiological signals resulted in more consistency with higher outcomes on both sensitivity and specificity metrics. Only six of the 21 studies had both sensitivity and specificity outcomes above 90.0 %, which included mono- and poly-signal approaches. Moreover, increases in the number of features used in the sleepiness detection system did not result in higher sensitivity and specificity outcomes. Overall, there was considerable variability between the studies reviewed, including measures of ground truth, the features employed and the machine learning approach of the systems. A critical need for progressing any system is a revalidation of the system on a new sample of users. These aspects indicate considerable progress is needed with physiological-based driver sleepiness systems before they are at a sufficient standard to be deployed on-road.}

abstract = {Road safety remains a challenge with numerous Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) suffering from injuries and death every year. Pedestrian protection using active safety systems, such as Automated Emergency Braking (AEB), is an effective measure to combat the situation. Furthermore, the perception of precrash scenarios plays an important role in active safety research. It is essential to understand and define precrash scenarios. This study aimed to apply the obtained typical car-to-pedestrian precrash scenarios from Chinese severely injured pedestrian traffic accidents to develop and test active safety systems. The National Automobile Accident In-Depth Investigation System (NAIS) recorded 467 cases from 2011 to 2018 in China, and 12 items were selected from the NAIS database as description variables for the precrash scenario. The items were divided into four categories: car, pedestrian, road, and environment. Group decision theory was applied to evaluate the importance of each variable in its category. A total of 34 basic scenarios were defined and obtained according to the extracted significant variables. These basic scenarios represented diverse fatal scenarios in China which are crucial for autonomous driving. The frequency distribution of the scenarios demonstrated that the top five scenarios covered 85.3 % of the total. Five scenarios were identified to have the common characteristic of cars going straight. Additionally, 13 detailed scenarios were obtained from the five basic scenarios by using cluster and frequency analyses. In contrast to the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) test scenarios, weather and lighting conditions were considered in these 13 scenarios, and the driving speed before the crash were mostly distributed in the range of 40–80 km/h (20–60 km/h in the NCAP). Meanwhile, both walking and running were commonly recorded for pedestrians to cross the street from the nearside, compared with records of walking only to cross from the nearside in the NCAP. These results contribute to a reference for test scenarios of pedestrian AEB or Forward Collision Warning (FCW) in China.}

abstract = {Pedestrian and bicycle safety is a key component in traffic safety studies. Various studies were conducted to address pedestrian and bicycle safety issues for intersections, road segments, etc. However, only a few studies investigated pedestrian and bicycle safety for bus stops, which usually have a relatively larger volume of pedestrians and bicyclists. Moreover, traditional reactive safety approaches require a significant number of historical crashes, while pedestrian and bicycle crashes are usually rare events. Alternatively, surrogate safety measures could proactively evaluate traffic safety status when crash data are rare or unavailable. This paper utilized critical bus driving events extracted from GPS trajectory data as pedestrian and bicycle surrogate safety measures for bus stops. A city-wide trajectory data from Orlando, Florida was used, which contains around 300 buses, 6,700,000 GPS records, and 1300 bus stops. Three critical driving events were identified based on the buses’ acceleration rates and stop time; hard acceleration, hard deceleration, and long stop. The relationships between critical driving events and crashes were examined using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. All three events were positively correlated with pedestrian and bicycle crashes. Long stop event has the highest correlation coefficient, followed by hard acceleration and hard deceleration. A Bayesian negative binomial model incorporating spatial correlation (Bayesian NB-CAR) was built to estimate the pedestrian and bicycle crash frequency using the generated events. The results were consistent with the correlation estimation. For example, hard acceleration and long stop events were both positively related to pedestrian and bicycle crashes. Moreover, model evaluation results indicated that the proposed Bayesian NB-CAR outperformed the standard Bayesian negative binomial model with lower Watanabe-Akaike Information Criterion (WAIC) and Deviance Information Criteria (DIC) values. In conclusion, this paper suggests the use of critical bus driving events as surrogate safety measures for pedestrian and bicycle crashes, which could be implemented in a proactive traffic safety management system.}

abstract = {Non-motorists involved in rail-trespassing crashes are usually more vulnerable to receiving major or fatal injuries. Previous research has used traditional quantitative crash data for understanding factors contributing to injury outcomes of non-motorists in train involved collisions. However, usually overlooked crash narratives can provide useful and unique contextual crash-specific information regarding factors associated with injury outcomes. The main objective of this study is to harness the rapid advancements in more sophisticated qualitative analysis procedures for identifying thematic concepts in unstructured crash narrative data. A two-staged hybrid approach is proposed where text mining is applied first to extract valuable information from crash narratives followed by inclusion of the new variables derived from text mining in formulation of advanced statistical models for injury outcomes. By using ten-year (2006−2015) non-motorist non-crossing trespassing injury data obtained from the Federal Railroad Administration, statistical procedures and advanced machine learning text analytics are applied to extract unique information on contributory factors of trespassers’ injury outcomes. The key concepts are systematically categorized into trespasser, injury, train, medical, and location related factors. A total of 13 unique variables are extracted from the thematic concepts that are not present in traditional tabular crash data. The analysis reveals a positive statistically significant association between presence of crash narrative and trespasser’s injury outcome (coded as minor, major, and fatal injury). Compared to crashes with minor injuries, crashes involving major and fatal injuries are more likely to be reported with crash narratives. A crosstabulation of new variables derived from text mining with injury outcomes revealed that trespassers with confirmed suicide attempts, trespassers wearing headphones, or talking on cell phones are more likely to receive fatal injuries. Among other factors identified, trespassers under alcohol influence, trespasser hit by commuter train, and advance warnings by engineer are associated with more severe (major and fatal) trespasser injury outcomes. Accounting for unobserved heterogeneity and controlling for other factors, fixed and random parameter discrete outcome models are developed to understand the heterogeneous correlations between trespasser injury outcomes and the new crash specific explanatory variables derived from text mining – providing deeper insights. Practical implications and future research directions are discussed.}

The trajectory data generated from CV technology can be used to identify real-time conflicts in intersections. To perform such identification, accurate vehicle localisation should be obtained to clearly recognise the conflicts between left-turning vehicles and straight-through vehicles in the opposite direction at the signal control intersection. This study presents a CV framework that uses the two-way time of arrival to locate the vehicles on the basis of the Intelligent Vehicle Infrastructure Cooperative Environment. Kalman Filter (KF) is used to improve the accuracy of the vehicle location, and the corresponding algorithm is used to estimate the vehicle trajectory to obtain the vehicle kinematics information via the on-board system. The traffic conflict areas of the left-turning vehicles and straight-through vehicles in the opposite direction are determined through vehicle trajectory extrapolation, and the left-turn collision at the signal intersection is identified using the post-encroachment time algorithm and vehicle movement information. In addition, Anderson–Darling and modified Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests are performed to verify the goodness of fit of the data. Results show that the vehicle speed and localisation errors of the proposed method decreased by 66.67 % and 83.33 % compared with the results before filtering, respectively. Moreover, the results of the conflict recognition method based on CV trajectory reconstruction is consistent for both goodness of fit tests under real-time communication conditions. This study can provide driving decision for drivers of left-turning vehicles under the Intelligent Vehicle Infrastructure Cooperative Environment and provide technical support for the research and development of left-turn anti-collision systems.}

Here, we propose a similar approach to the assessment of driving risk. Based on telematics data, and using quantile regression models, our methodology estimates the percentiles of the distance driven at speeds above the legal limit depending on drivers’ characteristics and the journeys made. We refer to the resulting graphs as percentile charts for speeding and illustrate their use for a sample of drivers with Pay-How-You-Drive insurance policies. We find that percentiles of distance driven at excessive speeds depend mainly on total distance driven, the percentage of driving in urban areas and the driver’s gender. However, the impact on the estimated percentile for these covariates is not constant. We conclude that the heterogeneity in the risk of driving long distances above the speed limit can be easily represented using reference charts and that, conversely, individual drivers can be scored by calculating an estimated percentile for their specific case. The dynamics of this risk score can be assessed by recording drivers as they accumulate driving experience and cover more kilometres. Our methodology should be useful for accident prevention and, in the context of Manage-How-You-Drive insurance, reference charts can provide real-time alerts and enhance recommendations for ensuring safety.}

abstract = {Traffic safety technologies revolve around two principle ideas; crash avoidance and injury mitigation for inevitable crashes. The development of relevant vehicle injury mitigating technologies should consider the interaction of those two technologies, ensuring that the inevitable crashes can be adequately managed by the occupant and vulnerable road user (VRU) protection systems. A step towards that is the accurate description of the expected crashes remaining when crash-avoiding technologies are available in vehicles. With the overall objective of facilitating the assessment of future traffic safety, this study develops a method for predicting crash configurations when introducing crash-avoiding countermeasures. The predicted crash configurations are one important factor for prioritizing the evaluation and development of future occupant and VRU protection systems. By using real-world traffic accident data to form the baseline and performing counterfactual model-in-the-loop (MIL) pre-crash simulations, the change in traffic situations (vehicle crashes) provided by vehicles with crash-avoiding technologies can be predicted. The method is built on a novel crash configuration definition, which supports further analysis of the in-crash phase. By clustering and grouping the remaining crashes, a limited number of crash configurations can be identified, still representing and covering the real-world variation. The developed method was applied using Swedish national- and in-depth accident data related to urban intersections and highway driving, and a conceptual Autonomous Emergency Braking system (AEB) computational model. Based on national crash data analysis, the conflict situations Same-Direction rear-end frontal (SD-ref) representing 53 % of highway vehicle-to-vehicle (v2v) crashes, and Straight Crossing Path (SCP) with 21 % of urban v2v intersection crashes were selected for this study. Pre-crash baselines, for SD-ref (n = 1010) and SCP (n = 4814), were prepared based on in-depth accident data and variations of these. Pre-crash simulations identified the crashes not avoided by the conceptual AEB, and the clustering of these revealed 5 and 52 representative crash configurations for the highway SD-ref and urban intersection SCP conflict situations, respectively, to be used in future crashworthiness studies. The results demonstrated a feasible way of identifying, in a predictive way, relevant crash configurations for in-crash testing of injury prevention capabilities.}

Take-over performance immediately after sleep is impaired and drivers perceive the take-over as critical. The aim of the presented study was to assess take-over behavior immediately after sleep and driving behavior during the 10 min after sleep. A study with N = 31 drivers was conducted in a high-fidelity driving simulator. Take-over performance and driving performance were assessed a) under alert baseline conditions and b) after awakening from electroencephalography-confirmed stable sleep. Take-over performance 15 s after awakening was impaired resulting in more driving errors compared to the alert baseline. Lane keeping was dramatically impaired in the first 3 min after sleep and recovered rapidly. Drivers drove slower after sleep and speed keeping was less stable for at least 10 min. The results suggest that human-machine interaction design should account for the drivers’ impaired post-sleep driving performance.}

The results from the coherent path analysis identified multiple speed measures of interest that have a statistically significant association with crashes as well as having intuitive and useful interpretation.

A review of the literature reveals the excellent potential of naturalistic driving studies carried out by collecting vehicle performance data and driver behavior data during normal, impaired, and safety-critical situations. An in-depth understanding of driver behavior helps analyze and implement pre-crash safety measures - the development of enforcement policies, infrastructure design, and intelligent vehicle safety systems. The present paper attempts to review the naturalistic driving studies that have been undertaken so far. The paper begins with an overview of different methods for collecting unobtrusive driver behavior data during their day to day trip, followed by a discussion of various factors affecting driving behavior and their influence on vehicle performance parameters. The paper also discusses the strategies mentioned in the literature for improving driving behavior using naturalistic driving studies to enhance road safety. Some of the major findings of this review suggest that i) driver behavior is a major cause in the majority of the road accidents ii) drivers generally reduce their speed and increases headway as a compensatory measure to reduce the workload imposed during distracting activity and adverse weather conditions iii) mobile phone has emerged as a potential device for collecting naturalistic driving data and, iv) improvement in driving behavior can be achieved by providing feedback to the drivers about their driving behavior. This can be done by implementing usage-based insurance schemes such as pay as you drive (PAYD), pay how you drive (PHYD), and manage how you drive (MHYD). While a considerable amount of research has been done to analyze driving behavior under naturalistic conditions, some areas which are yet to be explored are highlighted in the present paper.}

abstract = {Currently, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and automated vehicles (AV) are designed for use in the existing road infrastructure. These partially and fully automated vehicles will be operated in a shared space not only with other vehicles but also with vulnerable road users (VRU). Even though crashes between ADAS equipped vehicles or AV and VRU seem inevitable in such a scenario, functional safety, i.e., the assessment of the quality and safety level of the automation system, plays a crucial role in minimizing the crash frequency and the injury severity. We develop a data-driven approach to injury severity estimation for functional safety, i.e., ISO 26262 S-parameters, for four types of VRU: pedestrians, bicyclists, scooterists, and motorcycle riders. To estimate the S-parameter, the 90th-percentile of the injury severity distribution in the S-scale, a population-based data set (Germany's national data set DESTATIS) is used. Since the description of the injury severity in DESTATIS is not detailed enough for a direct one-to-one mapping to the S-scale, we enhance the level of detail in the population-based data set by using additional information from the German in-depth accident study (GIDAS), an in-depth, size-limited survey of part of the same population. Thus, we are able to transform the 4-level injury scale (uninjured, slightly injures, severely injured, and fatal) of the police reports found in DESTATIS into the three breakpoints of the injury severity scale (ISS) (ISS ≥{4, 9, 16}) which in turn directly translate to the four levels of the S-scale. Furthermore, the ISS ≥9 breakpoint more or less equates to MAIS 3+, the definition of ‘severe injury’ in nearly all international road safety goals that look beyond fatalities. The derived injury scale transformation can be utilized to translate the injury severities of the police-reported cases to the politically needed MAIS 3+ distribution. Thus, population-based data can be directly used to estimate the proportion of these ‘severely injured.’ The crashes are analyzed from the perspective of the VRU as well as from the vehicle type involved. We stratified the opposing vehicles by injury mechanism: wrap projection for bonnet type passenger vehicles (BTV), forward projection for box type vehicles like light trucks (LTV), as well as single-vehicle crashes. We cluster the crash data into traffic domains based on the speed limit: shared zone, residential streets, city roads, arterial thoroughfares, rural roads, and autobahn. For each VRU type, injury mechanism, and traffic domain, the S-parameters, i.e., the 90th-percentile of the injury severity measured in S-scale, are calculated with a one-sided 95% confidence level. Exemplary applications of the results are given in the discussion: an evaluation of an AV hitting a crossing pedestrian, an in-lane swerving ADAS system for VRU avoidance, and the rating of the nominal performance of an inflatable helmet for pedestrians.}

This unbalanced phenomenon poses a huge challenge to most of the statistical learning methods and needs to be addressed in the data preprocessing. To this end, we comparatively apply three data balance methods, i.e., the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), the Borderline SMOTE (BL-SMOTE), and the Majority Weighted Minority Oversampling (MWMOTE). Then, we examine different Bayesian networks (BNs) to explore the contributing factors of fatal injury crashes. The 2016 highway crash data of Ghana are retrieved for the case study. The results show that the accuracy of the injury severity classification is improved by using the preprocessed data. Highest improvement is observed on the data preprocessed by the MWMOTE technique. Statistical verification is done by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The inference results of the best BNs show the significant factors of fatal crashes which include off-peak time, non-intersection area, pedestrian involved collisions, rural road environment, good tarred road, roads without shoulders, and multiple vehicles involved crash.}

abstract = {As alternative transportation is getting more and more fashionable, and more people worldwide are "shifting" to walking trips, even for their daily commuting, traffic crashes suffered by pedestrians are still a great concern for road safety and public health researchers and practitioners. In this regard, risky or "aberrant" road behaviors have emerged, during the last few years, as a key issue to be considered for crash prevention. Nevertheless, the idea of a "generic pedestrian" is getting re-evaluated, and analyzing key features, such as gender, seems to be crucial for understanding pedestrians' performance and safety outcomes.
Objective
The objective of this study was to examine the effect of gender on pedestrians' both deliberate (traffic violations) and undeliberate (errors) risky walking behaviors, considering a set of theoretically based demographic and psychosocial variables as their potential predictors.
Method
For this cross-sectional study, data from 1070 Spanish pedestrians (60 % females and 40 % males, aged between 16 and 79) from the 17 regions of Spain, responding to an electronic questionnaire, were analyzed through a multi-group structural equation modeling (MGSEM) approach.
Results
Although age, handheld device-interaction, and sensation-seeking seem to have a similar effect on the errors and violations reported by both genders (similarities), factors such as risk perception, educational level and the misbehaviors observed in other road users are significant predictors only in the case of male pedestrians. On the other hand, road distractions have been shown to play a significant role in females' errors and violations, while males' road distractions seem to only affect their involuntary risky behaviors.
Conclusion
The findings of this study support the influence of gender in the statistical explanation of both deliberate and undeliberate walking risky road behaviors, also depicting the differential role of certain demographic and psychosocial factors when we compare male and female pedestrians.}

Understanding drivers’ use of peripheral vision to detect and react to threats is essential to modelling driver behavior and, eventually, preventing crashes caused by visual distraction. A between-group experiment with 83 participants was conducted in a high-fidelity driving simulator. Each driver in the experiment was exposed to an unexpected, critical, lead vehicle deceleration, when performing a self-paced, visual-manual, tracking task at different horizontal visual eccentricity angles (12°, 40° and 60°). The effect of visual eccentricity on threat detection, glance and brake response times was analyzed. Contrary to expectations, the driver glance response time was found to be independent of the eccentricity angle of the secondary task. However, the brake response time increased with increasing task eccentricity, when measured from the driver’s gaze redirection to the forward roadway. High secondary task eccentricity was also associated with a low threat detection rate and drivers were predisposed to perform frequent on-road check glances while executing the task. These observations indicate that drivers use peripheral vision to collect evidence for braking during off-road glances. The insights will be used in extensions of existing driver models for virtual testing of critical longitudinal situations, to improve the representativeness of the simulation results.}

Utilizing crash data collected from fifteen states in the United States for the period 2013–2017, the association between distracted driving crash severity and various built environment indicators was examined by the generalized ordered logit regression model. The results show that at a lower severity level, DD related crashes were found to be less severe at roundabouts or in urban areas, whereas the probability of injuries rather than property damage only (PDO) increases if an accident involves speeding or when occurring at an intersection or a curved road. Comparatively, at a higher severity level, the odds of severe (or fatal) injury involvement compared to minor injuries and PDO was found to be higher in a work-zone, a curved roadway, or when excessive speed was involved. Conversely, roundabouts and urban areas affected negatively in severe DD crash, which is consistent with the lower-level case. The study also reveals a state-specific variability of the influence of the built environment on the severity of DD related crashes. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the severity of DD related crashes for transportation safety planners or policymakers to develop customized policy recommendations, such as designing policies or roadway safety treatments, to curb the negative consequences of distracted driving.}

However, decisions regarding the simulated scenario and participants’ requirements do not often rely directly on traffic crash data. To fill the gap between simulation and real data, we have proposed a new framework based on Clustering Analysis (K-medoids) to support the definition of driving simulator experiments when the purpose is to investigate the driver behavior under real risky road conditions to improve road safety. The suggested approach was tested with data of three years of police records regarding loss-of-control crashes and information on three Brazilian rural highways’ geometry and traffic volume. The results showed the good suitability of the method to compile the data’s diversity into four clusters, representing and summarizing the crashes’ main characteristics in the region of study. Drivers’ attributes (age and gender) were initially intended to integrate the clustering analysis; however, due to the sample’s homogeneity of these characteristics, they did not contribute to the cluster definition. Hence, they were used simply to identify the target population for all scenarios. Therefore, we concluded that driving simulator experiments could benefit from the new approach since it identifies scenarios characterized by many variables connected to real risky situations and orients participants’ recruitment leading to efficient safety analysis.}

To understand the factors behind this differentiation and the effects they have, data covering 263 NUTS-2 (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) regions across Europe (European Union and Norway) have been analysed. The assessment was made using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). As a dependent variable the Road Fatality Rate (RFR – number of fatalities in a given year per one million population of the region) was used. The GWR was developed from 2014 data and took account of variables that characterise economic, infrastructural and social development. The model was validated using 2016–2018 data. The following factors were found to be statistically significant: gross domestic product per person (GDPPC), number of passenger cars per inhabitant (MRPC), share of passenger vehicles (PPC), life expectancy at birth (LIFE), as well as variables related to the border of the regions, innerborder (IB) and outerborder (OB). Results suggest that the GWR has an advantage over the global linear model which does not address regional proximity. The model allows for identification of the differences in the level of road safety in regions, estimated on the basis of the RFR and the available data in Eurostat databases. This in turn allows for indicating regions in which activities to improve road safety should have the highest priority. The model shows a large spatial diversity of factors affecting the RFR, which indicates the need to take different actions to improve road safety depending on the region. The results suggest that the GWR model can be useful for predicting and more efficient management of road safety at the regional level in Europe.}

In this study, the key factors contributing to the safety outcome in trucking transportation were identified using empirical data, including driving accident information, individual attributes, and task-related attributes. For this purpose, 306 driver records from 26 trucking companies in Japan were analysed. The driver sample was dichotomised by age into elderly drivers (age ≥ 50 years, referred to as older; N = 131) and young drivers (age < 50 years, referred to as younger; N = 175). Based on the analysis results, no significant age difference was identified in the likelihood of involvement in accidents for truck drivers. While older drivers who have penalty point records were more likely to be involved in traffic accidents, they were less affected by hard work conditions compared with young drivers. In conclusion, elderly drivers can be effectively employed as occupational drivers. They do not necessarily have a higher risk of accidents than young drivers. In addition, employment policies are proposed from a safety viewpoint, particularly for elderly truck drivers.}

The present study aims at utilizing crash narratives complemented by crash metadata to discern the prevalence and co-occurrence of themes that contribute to crash incidents. Ten years (2009–2018) of Michigan traffic fatal crash narratives were used as a case study. The structural topic modeling (STM) and network topology analysis were used to generate and examine the prevalence and interaction of themes from the crash narratives that were mainly categorized into pre-crash events, crash locations and involved parties in the traffic crashes. The main advantage of the STM over the other topic modeling approaches is that it allows the researchers to discover themes from documents and estimate how the topic relates to the document metadata. Topics with the highest prevalence for the angle, head-on, rear-end, sideswipe and single motor vehicle crashes were crash at stop-sign, crossing the centerline, unable to stop, lane change maneuver and run-off-road crash, respectively. Eigenvector centrality measure in network topology showed that event-related topics were consistently central in articulating the crash occurrence. The centrality and association between topics varied across crash types. The efficacy of generated topics in classifying crashes by type was tested using a machine learning algorithm, Random Forest. The classification accuracy in the held-out sample ranged between 89.3 % for sideswipe crashes to 99.2 % for single motor vehicle crashes. High classification accuracy suggests that automation of crash typing and consistency checks can be accomplished effectively by using extracted latent themes from the crash narratives.}

In these crashes, pedestrians are more vulnerable to fatal and/or severe injuries than car occupants. Therefore, it is necessary to have a better understanding of the relationship between pedestrian crashes and possible influencing factors, including road environment, traffic conditions, and population characteristics. In conventional studies, separate prediction models were established for pedestrian crashes and other crash types, which could have ignored possible correlations among the different crash types. Additionally, these influencing factors can contribute to pedestrian crashes in two manners, i.e., contributing to crash occurrence and propensity of pedestrian involvement. Furthermore, extensive pedestrian count data were generally not available, affecting the estimation of pedestrian crash exposure. In this study, a joint probability model is adopted for the simultaneous modeling of crash occurrence and pedestrian involvement in crashes; effects of possible influencing factors, including land use, road networks, traffic flow, population demographics and socioeconomics, public transport facilities, and trip attraction attributes, are considered. Additionally, trip generation and pedestrian activity data, based on a comprehensive household travel survey, are used to determine pedestrian crash exposure. Markov chain Monte Carlo full Bayesian approach is then applied to estimate the parameters. Results indicate that crash occurrence is correlated to traffic flow, number of non-signalized intersections, and points of interest such as restaurants and hotels. By contrast, population age, ethnicity, education, household size, road density, and number of public transit stations could affect the propensity of pedestrian involvement in crashes. These findings indicate that better design and planning of built environments are necessary for safe and efficient access for pedestrians and for the long-term improvement of walkability in a high-density city such as Hong Kong.}

Pharmacological differences among different drug classes influence human cognition, visual, and motor behavior in different ways. These differences impact driving safety, and therefore individuals who use stimulant and opioid drugs might experience different patterns in driving safety and impairment in driving performance. This study examined the effect of long-term use of stimulant drugs and of opiate drugs on driving performance, hazard perception, visual search skills and psychomotor skills related to driving.
Methods
A total of 75 individuals, including 28 predominantly stimulant users, 22 predominantly opiate users and 25 healthy non-drug users, participated. Driving performance and psychomotor skills were assessed via a 15-minute drive in a simulator; hazard perception was assessed via a computerized task; and visual search skill was assessed by eye tracking.
Results
ANOVA analyses indicate both stimulant and opiate users drove at higher speeds and experienced more crashes than the healthy non-drug users. Stimulant but not opiate users violated red light regulations more often than the healthy non-drug users. In the hazard perception task, stimulant drug users performed more poorly than both opioid drug users and healthy non-drug users. Specifically, they had lower saccade movement scores and higher average fixation times.
Conclusions
Results confirm that both stimulant drug users and opiate drug users show impaired driving performance compared to healthy non-drug users. Stimulant drug users possessed poorer hazard perception skills compared to the opiate users and the control group, perhaps as a result of cognitive deficits created by the drug use.}

Thus, this study aims to explore drivers’ decision-making process and RLR behaviors at intersection dilemma zones and evaluate the effectiveness of the RLR auditory-warning (RLR-AW) system in both fog and clear weather conditions. A concept of the RLR-AW system was proposed and designed in a driving simulator experiment. The simulated driving with the RLR-AW system was conducted in both clear and foggy weather conditions. The results show that drivers took compensation actions in fog while approaching the intersection, such as driving at lower speeds and using harder maximum brakes. The RLR-AW was able to reduce RLR rates in both clear and fog conditions, and drivers tended to respond more quickly and take smoother brake reactions with the RLR-AW provided. Moreover, the RLR-AW showed more remarkable influences on drivers’ behaviors in fog with higher decrement in brake reaction time and maximum deceleration rate. Overall, findings of the study shed light on the design of in-vehicle RLR-AW system and highlight the necessity of drivers applying the system in adverse weather conditions.}

A sample (n = 2,084) of surveys collected from adults in the U.S. was analyzed using SEM to reveal the latent structure of the belief system associated with DUIC. The results of this analysis indicated that reported DUIC behavior (frequency and recency) was predicted by willingness that influenced intention. Willingness and intention were directly influenced by control beliefs, attitudes, norms, and attitudes (prototype image) toward people who never DUIC. Intention was also influenced by attitudes toward people who do DUIC. Intention had a stronger influence on DUIC than willingness alone. These components were influenced by underlying behavioral, normative, and control beliefs. Thus, strategies that can change these beliefs may also reduce DUIC.}

WWD studies and mitigation strategies have exclusively been focused on limited-access facilities. However, it has been established that WWD crashes on arterial corridors are also severe and relatively more common. As such, this study focused on determining factors influencing the severity of WWD crashes on arterials. The analysis was based on five years of WWD crashes (2012–2016) that occurred on state-maintained arterial corridors in Florida. Police reports of 2,879 crashes flagged as “wrong-way” were downloaded and individually reviewed. The manual review of the police reports revealed that of the 2,879 flagged WWD crashes, only 1,890 (i.e., 65.6 %) occurred as a result of a vehicle traveling the wrong way. The Bayesian partial proportional odds (PPO) model was used to establish the relationship between the severity of these WWD crashes and different driver attributes, temporal factors, and roadway characteristics. The following variables were significant at the 90 % Bayesian Credible Interval (BCI): day of the week, lighting condition, presence of work zone, crash location, age and gender of the wrong-way driver, airbag deployment, alcohol use, posted speed limit, speed ratio (i.e., driver’s speed over the posted speed limit), and the manner of collision. Based on the model results, specific countermeasures on Education, Engineering, Enforcement, and Emergency response are discussed. Potential Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TSM\&O) strategies for WWD detection systems on arterials to minimize WWD frequency and severity are also proposed.}

To generate data, we sampled from the latent space containing crash data. The generated data was compared with the real data from different statistical aspects. t-Test, Levene-test and Kolmogrove Smirnov test showed that the generated data was statistically similar to the real data. It was also compared to some of the minority oversampling techniques like SMOTE and ADASYN as well as the GAN framework for generating data. Crash prediction models based on Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were used to compare the generated data from the different oversampling techniques. Overall, variational autoencoder (VAE) showed excellent results compared to the other data augmentation methods. Specificity is improved by 8% and 4% for VAE-LR and VAE-SVM respectively when compared to SMOTE while the sensitivity is improved by 6% and 5% when compared to ADASYN.

As such, it may be useful to introduce the legal principle of ‘deemed impaired’ with respect to fatigue and/or sleep loss. A comprehensive review of the impairment and accident literature was performed, including 44 relevant publications. Findings from this review suggests that a driver or worker might reasonably be ‘deemed impaired’ once the amount of sleep falls below five hours in the prior 24. Building on the legal principles first outlined in recent New Jersey legislation (Maggie’s Law), this review argues that an individual can reasonably be ‘deemed impaired’ based on prior sleep wake behaviour. In Maggie’s Law, a driver can be indirectly ‘deemed impaired’ if they have not slept in the prior 24 h. Based on the extant literature, we argue that, relative to drug and alcohol intoxication, this may be overly conservative. While roadside measurement of fatigue and prior sleep-wake behavior is not yet possible, we suggest that public education programs should provide specific guidance on the amount of sleep required and that post-accident forensic examination of prior sleep wake behaviours may help the community to determine unsafe behaviours and liability more objectively than is currently the case.}

This paper examines the rider and road environment correlates of women’s cycling. While most earlier studies relied on self-report data to understand gender differences in cycling, this study video-recorded 24,868 riders (22 % female) at 17 sites across Queensland, Australia. The probabilities of an observed rider being female under different circumstances (e.g., speed limit, riding location, time of riding, group riding) at these sites were modelled in a binomial logistic regression framework. The likelihood of a rider being a woman was greater during the day (9am-8pm) than the early morning (5–9 a.m.); on weekends than on weekdays; in groups of two or more riders than among single riders; in lower speed zones than speed zones of 60 km/h or over; on roads with bike lanes or multiple traffic lanes or raised medians than on roads without these, and in urban areas than suburban areas. The likelihood of the rider being a woman was lower among those riding road bikes than other types of bicycles. The use of a naturalistic study design marks the key strength of this paper. Findings of this study should help better understand women’s cycling patterns and preferred cycling locations, which cycling communities and organisations can use to advocate for better roads and paths that make female riders feel safe.}

A reduced subset of driving data for 19 drivers from the Virginia Connected Corridors 50 Elite Naturalistic Driving Study was used to assess whether driver eye glance behavior and secondary task engagement were different when driver assistance systems were active compared to when they were available but inactive (n = 148). The results of this study demonstrate that drivers spent more time looking away from the road while driving automation systems were active and that drivers were more likely to be observed browsing on their cell phones while using driving automation systems. Current driving automation features require human monitoring of automation, yet the drivers of these automation-equipped vehicles are inclined to engage in secondary tasks and take longer and more frequent glances away from the roadway. It is possible that performance effects, such as omission errors or delayed reactions, may occur as a result of drivers’ substandard monitoring of the driving scene.}

Different survey methods have been used to study bicyclists’ behavior, experiences, and preferences; ranging from verbally described facilities to surveys including images and videos. Virtual Reality (VR) experiments blur the boundaries between stated preference (SP) surveys and revealed preference (RP) surveys and provide a realistic sense of design. This research introduces a novel research method in bicycling research and discusses the results of an experiment using a bicycle simulator combined with immersive VR. In total, 150 participants participated in this experiment and were asked about demographics and perceptions and preferences after bicycling in five different environments with an instrumented bicycle in VR. A 5 × 2 mixed design was used with bicycling environment as within-subject factor and pedestrian / traffic volume as between-subject factor. ANOVA tests revealed how each environment and ambient pedestrian / traffic volume affected perceived level of safety (PLOS) and willingness to bicycle (WTB). Pairwise comparison showed that participants felt safer bicycling on the segregated bicycle path compared to bicycling on the painted bicycle path on the road and roadside. There was no meaningful difference between WTB for less than 10 min and WTB for more than 10 min between bicycling on a painted bicycle path on the sidewalk and painted bicycle path on the road. PLOS and WTB ratings of men and women were not significantly different from each other. The older segment of the sample was more worried about roadside bicycling and bicycle commuters were more confident to ride on the roadside. Despite having several limitations, immersive 360-degree VR was found a powerful presentation tool to evaluate future street designs which can inform transport and urban planning.}

Traditional SPFs are usually developed by using annual average daily traffic (AADT) along with geometric characteristics. However, the high level of aggregation may lead to a failure to capture the temporal variation in traffic characteristics (e.g., traffic volume and speed) and crash frequencies. In this study, SPFs at different aggregation levels were developed based on microscopic traffic detector data from California, Florida, and Virginia. More specifically, five aggregation levels were considered: (1) annual average weekday hourly traffic (AAWDHT), (2) annual average weekend hourly traffic (AAWEHT), (3) annual average weekday peak/off-peak traffic (AAWDPT), (4) annual average day of the week traffic (AADOWT), and (5) annual average daily traffic (AADT). Model estimation results showed that the segment length and volume, as exposure variables, are significant across all the aggregation levels. Average speed is significant with a negative coefficient, and the standard deviation of speed was found to be positively associated with the crash frequency. It is noteworthy that the operation of the high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes was found to have a positive effect on crash frequency across all the aggregation levels. The model results also showed that the AAWDPT and AADOWT models consistently performed better (the improvements range from 3.14%–16.20%) than the AADT-based SPF, which implies that the differences between the day of the week and peak/off-peak periods should be considered in the development of crash prediction models. The model transferability results indicated that the SPFs between Florida and Virginia are transferrable, while the models between California and the other two states are not transferrable.}

Whilst driving in the automated mode, cognitive load was manipulated using the “N-Back” task, which participants engaged with via a visual display. Results suggest that non-optimal levels of workload during the automated driving conditions impair driving performance, especially lateral control of the vehicle, and the magnitude of this impairment varied with increasing cognitive load. In addition to these findings, the present paper introduces a novel method for determining stabilisation times of both driver state and driving performance indicators following a transition of vehicle control. Using this method we demonstrate that mean and standard deviation of lane position impairments were found to take longer to stabilise following transition to manual driving following a higher level of cognitive load during the automated driving period, taking up to 22 s for driving performance to normalise after take-over. In addition, heart rate parameters take between 20 and 30 s to stabilise following a planned take-over request. Finally, this paper demonstrates how the magnitude of cognitive load can be estimated in context of automated driving using physiological measures, captured by consumer electronic devices. We discuss the impact our findings have on the design of SAE Level 3 systems. Relevant suggestions are provided to the research community and automakers working on future implementation of vehicles capable of conditional automation.}

abstract = {Measures to protect vulnerable road users during low-speed maneuvers are required. For example, systems that use cameras to display the vehicle's rearview are popular. However, some vehicles are difficult to equip with a rear view camera system. To avoid a crash when driving in reverse, it is also effective to identify the presence of pedestrians via an audible warning using a device (e.g., clearance sonar). It may be cheaper to install than a rearview camera system. Installation cost is also important for the spread of equipment that reduces a crash. It is necessary to clarify the minimum specifications that balance cost and reduce crashes. Device specifications (e.g., detection distance and response delay) may affect the crash reduction rate. There should be a detection distance required for the sonar to have the same crash reduction effect as the rear view camera system. Thus, in this study, we conducted experiments and obtained data about how a vehicle moves and driver reactions to audible warnings when driving in reverse. Based on the acquired data, a numerical simulation was performed to determine whether a driver could avoid a crash under various circumstances. As a result, it was shown that the clearance sonar must have a detection distance of 0.8 m or more to expect the same effect as a rearview camera system. In other words, to expect sonar to have the same performance as a rearview camera, a detection distance of at least 0.8 m should be set as a specification.}

abstract = {In the United States, a disproportionate number of motor vehicle crash fatalities occur in rural areas. While many factors likely contribute to the discrepancy between fatality rates in rural and urban areas, prior studies suggest that rural drivers may be more likely to engage in risky driving behaviors like seat belt non-use. Although having favorable attitudes or beliefs about seat belts increases the likelihood of wearing them, few studies have investigated the possibility that lower rates of seat belt use in rural areas may result from a greater prevalence of unfavorable seat belt attitudes and beliefs—one part of a distinct rural “traffic safety culture.” In the current study, we analyzed responses from the 2016 Motor Vehicle Occupant Safety Survey (MVOSS) to test the hypotheses that rural drivers are more likely than urban drivers to hold unfavorable attitudes and beliefs about seat belts, and that these unfavorable attitudes and beliefs predict lower self-reported seat belt use. We found that rural and urban drivers differed significantly on several seat belt attitudes and beliefs and that these differences persisted after controlling for possible demographic differences between rural and urban drivers. We also found that drivers who hold less favorable attitudes and beliefs were less likely to always wear their seat belts. However, even after accounting for demographic factors and differences in attitudes and beliefs, rural drivers continued to be less likely to report full-time seat belt use than urban drivers. Our findings suggest that rural drivers should be treated as a distinct market segment for seat belt messaging and public awareness campaigns, and that interventions designed to change the unfavorable attitudes and beliefs about seat belts held by rural drivers may help reduce the disparity between rural and urban traffic fatality rates.}

C-ITS can share useful traffic information between connected vehicles (CV) and between vehicles and infrastructure in support of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) wireless communications. An excellent feature of a C-ITS pre-deployment project in Korean freeways that CVs are equipped with an in-vehicle forward collision warning system. This technical support provides a useful opportunity to evaluate crash risks more objectively and scientifically based on the analysis of vehicle interactions, which motivates our study. The purpose of this study is to develop a road safety information system based on the analysis of CV data. The proposed system estimates individual vehicle crash risks based on the crash potential index (CPI) and further utilizes them to develop a methodology for assessing road safety risks on freeways. High CPIs were observed in toll plaza area, recurrent congestion sections, and on and off-ramp areas. An encouraging result showed that the relationship between the estimated CPI and the actual crash frequencies was statistically meaningful. In addition, the impact of the CV market penetration rate (MPR) on the feasibility of the proposed road risk monitoring method was explored by microscopic traffic simulation experiments using VISSIM. A safety evaluation equivalent to 100 % MPR was obtainable with 30 % MPR. The outcomes of this study are expected to be utilized as fundamental to support the development of novel road risk monitoring systems in C-ITS environments.}

The quantitative case study of the continuous changing process of system safety in the evolution process of the Yong-Wen railway accident shows that the visualized outputs obtained by using this method are consistent with the actual situation. This method has the potential to be applied in the real-time monitoring of railway system safety and the early warning of train accidents.}

abstract = {The study aims to identify relevant variables to improve the prediction performance of the crash injury severity (CIS) classification model. Unfortunately, the CIS database is invariably characterized by the class imbalance. For instance, the samples of multiple fatal injury (MFI) severity class are typically rare as opposed to other classes. The imbalance phenomenon may introduce a prediction bias in favour of the majority class and affect the quality of the learning algorithm. The paper proposes an ensemble-based variable ranking scheme that incorporates the data resampling. At the data pre-processing level, majority weighted minority oversampling (MWMOTE) is employed to treat the imbalanced training data. Ensemble of classifiers induced from the balanced data is used to evaluate and rank the individual variables according to their importance to the injury severity prediction. The relevant variables selected are then applied to the balanced data to form a training set for the CIS classification modelling. An empirical comparison is conducted through considering the variable ranking by: 1) the learning of single inductive algorithm with imbalanced data where the relevant variables are applied to the imbalanced data to form the training data; 2) the learning of single inductive algorithm with MWMOTE data and the relevant variables identified are applied to the balanced data to form the training data; and 3) the learning of ensembles with imbalanced data where the relevant variables identified are applied to the imbalanced data to form the training data. Bayesian Networks (BNs) classifiers are then developed for each ranking method, where nested subsets of the top ranked variables are adopted. The model predictions are captured in four performance indicators in the comparative study. Based on three-year (2014–2016) crash data in Ghana, the empirical results show that the proposed method is effective to identify the most prolific predictors of the CIS level. Finally, based on the inference results of BNs developed on the best subset, the study offers the most probable explanations to the occurrence of MFI crashes in Ghana.}

A report by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reveals that motorcyclists have 27 times the risk of fatality in traffic crashes as much as motor vehicle drivers. Previous studies have identified a list of risk factors associated with motorcyclist injury severity and generated valuable insights for countermeasures to protect motorcyclists in crashes. These studies have shown that wearing helmets and/or motorcycle-specific reflective clothing and boots, driving alcohol/drug-free, and obeying traffic regulations are good practices for safe motorcycling. However, these practices and other risk factors are likely to interact with local geographic, socio-economic, and cultural contexts, leading to diversified correlations with motorcyclist injury severity, which remains under-explored. Such correlations may exhibit variations across space and time. The objective of this study is to revisit the correlates of motorcyclist injury severity with a focus on the spatial and temporal variations of correlations between risk factors and injury severity. This study employed an integrated spatiotemporal analytical approach to mine comprehensive statewide 20 years’ motorcycle-involved traffic crashes (N = 50,823) in Pennsylvania. Non-stationarity tests were performed to examine the significance of variations in spatially and temporally local correlations. The results show that most factors, such as helmet, engine size, vehicle age, pillion passenger, at-fault striking, and speeding, hold significant non-stationary relationships with motorcyclist injury severity. Furthermore, cluster analysis of estimations reveals the regional similarities of correlates, which may help practitioners develop regional motorcyclist safety countermeasures.}

Vehicular trajectory data, extracted from the Federal Highway Administration’s Next Generation Simulation dataset, are utilized and 579 lane-changing vehicle groups are examined. Stopping distance indexes are developed to evaluate the potential collision risks of lane-changing vehicle groups. Three mixed binary logit models and three mixed logit models with heterogeneity in means and variances are established based on different perception reaction time. Model estimation results show that several variables significantly affect the risk status of lane-changing vehicle groups, including the mean values of clearance distance and speed differences between the leading vehicle in the current lane and the subject vehicle, standard deviations of clearance distance, and speed differences between these two vehicles, as well as standard deviations of the speed difference between the subject vehicle and the following vehicle in the target lane. Interestingly, the influences of the last three variables differ considerably across the observations and the mean of the random parameter for standard deviations of clearance distance between CLV and SV is associated with the mean speed difference between CLV and SV. Since one of the explanations is individual heterogeneity, personalized designs for advanced driver assistance system would be an effective measure to reduce the risk.}

Persons in the control group were not sanctioned with an AIIP, but had their case settled in the criminal court. Our outcome measure was the percentage of offenders who committed at least one new DUI offence within the follow-up period. Results indicate that the percentage of repeat offenders in the AIIP group was lower than in the control group. Additional analyses indicate that were an AIIP to be imposed alongside a criminal settlement, a recidivism reduction of 4 percentage points (4 % versus 8 %) could be expected. This would translate to a relative decrease of 54 %. Explanations for these findings are discussed.}

abstract = {As both a utility mode of transport and recreational activity, cycling has well-known health, environmental, and economic benefits. For these reasons it has been encouraged in many countries, including the Republic of Ireland. However, with increasing popularity there have been concurrent increases in road traffic related cyclist injuries. This study aims to characterise cyclist collisions, which are known to be underreported in Police statistics. For data collection, a survey addressing collisions was distributed to cyclists across the country in 2018. Univariable testing was used to identify differences in collision factors and injury outcomes for cyclist collisions with motorised vehicles, and those where a motorised vehicle is not involved as a collision partner i.e. single cyclist, cyclist-pedestrian, or cyclist-cyclist collisions. Furthermore, binary logistic regression modelling was used to clarify biasing factors for Police reporting of collisions. The largest proportion of collisions was between cyclists and motorised vehicles (56%), followed by single cyclist collisions (29%), collisions with other cyclists (8%), and pedestrians (7%). The odds of Police reporting for collisions with motorised vehicles in this study was 20 times greater than single cyclist collisions, 10 times greater than cyclist-cyclist collisions, and 4 times greater than collisions with pedestrians. The odds of Police reporting of serious injury collisions was 7 times greater than minor injury collisions. There were several differences in road, environmental, and human factors, and injury patterns between cyclist-motorised vehicle collisions and non-motorised vehicle collisions. The findings of this study indicate that greater attention should be paid to the following underreported collision types: 1) those that do not involve collisions with motorised vehicles (single cyclist collisions in particular), which have been shown to have differing collision characteristics to motorised vehicle collisions, and 2) less severe injuries, which have been shown to be a substantial contributor to the cyclist safety problem. Furthermore, surveys have been shown to be a valuable mechanism for investigation of lower severity cyclist injuries, which are largely unrecorded in Police or hospital data.}

abstract = {Operating speed is often used to evaluate consistency in road geometric design. In the China, the Specifications for Highway Safety Audit includes a spot-based speed model that predicts operating speed by dividing the road into homogeneous segments and observing the speeds at sparsely spaced spots. This paper presents a continuous speed model as a more representative alternative for roads with complex alignments, and can be applied to tunnel sections as one general model. The model considers the road geometric characteristics not only at the vehicle’s current position, but also in its neighborhood by including the effects of adjacent segments. Before such a model can be confidently used, however, its transferability must be confirmed for roads other than those used for the model’s development. This study therefore used data collected at two freeways to demonstrate transferability, as well as the advantages of the continuous speed model over the spot-based model. Results of the spot-based model showed large prediction errors, and changes in the predicted speeds along the road were abrupt and discontinuous. On the other hand, the continuous model’s prediction errors were smaller and the predicted speed profile was, as expected, continuous. The continuous model performed well at estimating operating speed on the studied freeway and, most importantly, it can predict operating speeds for out-of-sample roads of the same type as the studied roads. That is, it passed the transferability test. This finding opens an opportunity for evaluating roads in the design stage while minimizing the number of costly driving simulation experiments. Transferring a continuous speed model is a recommended alternative, particularly when high-priced construction is required for roads with challenging conditions such as mountainous terrain.}

The study assesses the prevalence rates of alcohol- and drug-involved driving in Catalonia (Spain).
Method
Drivers were randomly selected for roadside testing using a stratified random sampling procedure representative of all vehicles circulating on non-urban roads. Mandatory alcohol and drug tests were performed during autumn 2017. A sample of 6860 drivers were tested for alcohol use, of these 671 were also tested for drugs. Standard procedures were employed by traffic officers to detect alcohol and drug use. Alcohol breath tests were performed with breathalyser devices and on-site drug screening systems were used to test for drugs.
Results
The prevalence of alcohol use above the legal limit and drug use were 1.2 % (95 % CI: 0.9–1.5 %) and 8.3 % (95 % CI: 5.8–11.2 %), respectively. The most frequent drugs detected were THC (5.6 %, 95 % CI: 3.7–8.0 %), cocaine (3.5 %, 95 % CI: 2.0–5.5 %) and amphetamines (1.6 %, 95 % CI: 0.6–3.4 %). Alcohol use was detected more frequently on conventional roads, at weekends and during night-time hours. Drug use was detected more frequently in young males during daytime hours.
Conclusions
Driver risk profiles associated with alcohol use and drug use differ. Positive alcohol use is not a predictor of drug use when controlling for all other factors.}

The ASSM tested the contribution of demographics, split TPB, additional predictors and past behaviour to young drivers' speeding at two moments of time, over three months. Hierarchical multiple regression revealed that participants most likely to speed in the future were those who have done so in the past (independent predictor (ip): past compliance with the speed limit), and who were not certain in their ability to control their speeding (ip: self-efficacy). ASSM also indicated that people who reported speeding at T1 did so at T2 as well (ip: past compliance with the speed limit). The results also show that sensitive to rewards people would speed more (ip: sensitivity to reward), similar to ones with less control over their behaviour (ip: perceived controllability) or with more driving experience (ip: GDL phase). Overall, the ASSM explained 73% of the intention to comply with speed limits variation and 62% of the present compliance with the speed limit variation. Compared to models, similar in structure to ASSM, our model explained variance in intention, equal to the previously maximum observed, and 22% more variance in behaviour. As a result, our findings may help design better targeted educational campaigns to prevent young drivers' speeding.}

To evaluate the relationship between visual function and a five-year history of motor vehicle collision rates in older adults. Motion perception impairment was explored as a risk factor for motor vehicle collisions for the first time in this study.
Materials and methods
Participants were licensed drivers ≥70 years old enrolled in the Alabama VIP Older Driver Study who underwent functional assessments for motion perception, distance visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, visual field sensitivity, and visual processing speed. Participants were recruited based on their being patients in an ophthalmology clinic in the year prior to enrollment or had participated in an earlier driving study. Crash reports were obtained from the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency for the 5 years prior to enrollment and mileage estimated using the Driving Habits Questionnaire. Crude and age-adjusted rate ratios (RRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) were calculated using Poisson regression.
Results
159 participants enrolled with a mean age of 79 years. The age-adjusted crash rate was higher among those with worse motion perception (RR: 2.7, 95 % CI: 1.4−5.2), severe slowing in visual processing speed (RR: 3.6, 95 % CI: 1.5−8.5), and impaired peripheral visual field sensitivity (RR: 2.4, 95 % CI: 1.3−4.4).
Conclusions
Among a sample of older drivers, crash rates were higher for those with impaired motion perception, severely slowed visual processing speed, and impaired peripheral visual field sensitivity. The association between motion perception and crash risk in older drivers has not been previously reported. Prospective analysis of the Alabama VIP Older Driver Study will examine these risk factors for future collision involvement based on naturalistic driving data.}

We create a model based on this visual information, wherein the retinal image corresponding to vehicle velocity perception is broken down into tangential components and normal components in a two-dimensional polar coordinate system that employs the nodal point of the eyeball as the origin. Our visual model uses the relationship between the tangential and normal components of the velocity to calculate the distance at which the velocity of the vehicle can be perceived by pedestrians. The maximum distance at which vehicle velocity can be perceived by pedestrians derived from the visual model is consistent with the timing at which a vehicle collides with a pedestrian most frequently in the pedestrian accidents gleaned from accident statistics. The result of the simulation of the visual model showed that the eye height of the pedestrian, the total height of the vehicle and the sensory threshold of motion determine the components by which the maximum perception distance of the vehicle velocity is given. These findings contribute to the enhancement of safety measures in traffic accidents from the pedestrian’s perspective.}

In efforts to improve safety, an enormous interest has been shown in developing statistical models for intersection crash prediction and explanation. The selection of an adequate form of the statistical model is of great importance for the accurate estimation of crash frequency and the correct identification of crash contributing factors. Using a six-year crash data, road infrastructure and geometric design data, and traffic flow data of urban intersections, we applied three different functional forms of negative binomial models (i.e., NB-1, NB-2, NB-P) and a generalized Poisson (GP) model to develop safety performance functions (SPF) by crash severity for signalized and unsignalized intersections. This paper presents the relationships found between the explanatory variables and the expected crash frequency. It reports the comparison of different models for total, injury \& fatal, and property damage only crashes in order to obtain ones with the maximum estimation accuracy. The comparison of models was based on the goodness of fit and the prediction performance measures. The fitted models showed that the traffic flow and several variables related to road infrastructure and geometric design significantly influence the intersection crash frequency. Further, the goodness of fit and the prediction performance measures revealed that the NB-P model outperformed other models in most crash severity levels for signalized intersections. For the unsignalized intersections, the GP model was the best performing model. When only the NB models were compared, the functional form NB-P performed better than the traditional NB-1 and, more specifically, the NB-2 models. In conclusion, our findings suggest a potential improvement in the estimation accuracy of the SPFs for urban intersections by applying the NB-P and GP models.}

Changes in participants brain wave activity as measured using an Electroencephalography (EEG), along with subjective measures and driving performance were analysed. Forty-five drivers were randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups (ambient noise group at 40 dBA and broadband noise groups at 55 dBA and 75 dBA) and asked to complete a 90 min monotonous drive. Alpha brain wave activity, subjective fatigue response and deteriorating driving performance all indicate the monotonous drive to be fatiguing. Noise effects were evident with theta brain wave activity where the two noise groups (55 dBA and 75 dBA) had higher levels of theta activity than the ambient noise group. However, no interactions for time by noise were evident in any of the recorded brain activity frequency bands, although trends were evident with alpha activity. These results are discussed from both a theoretical and applied perspective.}

The crash data used was obtained through a comprehensive Motorcycle Crash Causation Study (MCCS) by the Federal Highway Administration. An anatomic injury severity indicator, the New Injury Severity Score (NISS), is utilized to calculate a total score as the sum of squared the abbreviated injury scale scores of each of the rider’s three most severe injuries. A hybrid approach integrating Latent Class Clustering (LCC) and Ordered Probit (OP) models was used to uncover the unobserved heterogeneity and to explore the major factors which significantly affect the injury severities resulting from single-, two- and multi-vehicle crashes involving a motorcycle. The results show that the significant differences in severity exist between different numbers of vehicles involved. More importantly, they also indicate dividing motorcycle crashes into homogeneous classes before modelling helps to discover insightful information. Pre-speed of the motorcycle is found to be a main factor associated with serious and critical injuries in most types of crashes. Findings of the study provide specific and insightful countermeasures targeting at the contributing factors of motorcycle crashes.}

Young drivers ages 15–24 continue to constitute a high-risk population for fatal motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) compared to all other age groups. Driving under the influence of cannabis is an important contributor to the high rates of MVCs among youth. Understanding the specific impact of cannabis on the driving performance outcomes of young drivers can inform injury prevention, education, and intervention strategies.
Objectives
This systematic literature review (SLR) aims to determine the Class (I- highest to IV-lowest) of evidence and level of confidence (A-high to U-insufficient) in the effects of cannabis on the driving performance of young drivers.
Methods
Registered in PROSPERO (#CRD42020180541), this SLR searched seven data bases and appraised the quality and confidence in the evidence using an established research methodology.
Results
Class II evidence suggests that THC is likely to reduce mean speed and reaction time; headway distance, increase lane and steering wheel position variability among young drivers (Level B, moderate confidence).
Conclusions
This study shows that there is a moderate to low level of confidence on the impact of cannabis on the specific driving performance outcomes of young drivers. A need remains for Class I and II studies that focus on the specific effects on young drivers, distinguish between the biological and socially constructed variables of sex and gender, and includes larger and more representative samples.}

However, quantitative evaluation of smartphone users' detection performance during distracted walking has been scarce.

Thirty-eight young smartphone users performed ground-level visual cue detection trials, 1) while walking upright on a treadmill without using a smartphone; 2) when conducting one-handed browsing while walking; and, 3) when conducting two-handed texting while walking. Visual cues were presented on the ground at 24 locations by a ceiling-mounted projector, and participants were asked to respond verbally when they perceived the appearance of each cue. Study results show that the concurrent use of a smartphone decreased the detection rate significantly (p < 0.05) from 93.5 % to 76.3∼74.1 %, and increased the reaction time from 0.90 s to 1.04∼1.15 s. Among the 24 cue locations, cues that were presented closer to participants were detected significantly (p < 0.05) more often and faster than cues that were shown at further locations. The results of this laboratory-based study imply that the ground-level signals might not be detected well by smartphone users, specifically when they were conducting more demanding tasks such as texting while walking. However, the laboratory conditions were confined to a specific usage environment; therefore, future research should be focused on the situation awareness of smartphone users under various usage scenarios and more realistic environments.}

The aim of the study is to compare driving exposure, patterns and factors associated with safety critical events between drivers with MCI and a comparison group without cognitive impairment.
Design, setting, participants
Naturalistic driving data using an in-vehicle monitoring device were collected from 36 older drivers with MCI and 35 older drivers without cognitive impairment over a two-week period in Western Australia.
Measurements
Naturalistic driving exposure, patterns (eg. night-time trips, peak-hour trips) and safety critical events (harsh acceleration, harsh braking and harsh cornering).
Results
Drivers with MCI had a lower number of safety critical events (mean = 7.20, SD = 11.44) compared to drivers without cognitive impairment (mean = 10.89, SD = 23.30) however, this was not statistically significantly. There were also no statistically significant differences between drivers with and without MCI for measures of driving exposure or any of the driving patterns including weekday trips, night-time trips and trips on highways/freeways. The results of the multivariable modelling found only binocular contrast sensitivity was associated with the rate of safety critical events. For every increase of 0.1 log units in contrast sensitivity (better contrast sensitivity) the rate of safety critical events significantly decreased by 30 % (IRR = 0.70, 95 % CI = 0.50−0.98, p = 0.04).
Conclusion
Drivers with MCI were found to have similar driving exposure and patterns compared to older drivers without cognitive impairment, however drivers with better contrast sensitivity experienced fewer safety critical events. Future research should consider a longitudinal study design with an extended driving monitoring period and a larger sample with a clinical diagnosis of MCI to assess changes in cognition and its impact on driving.}

While extant strategies may similarly stigmatize this risky behavior, we contend the stigmatizing effect of news narratives offers an untapped and unexamined resource. In this paper we draw on emergent findings in narrative persuasion work to present an exploratory analysis and evidence indicates news narratives, through narrative engagement, can both stigmatize TWD behavior and diminish attitudes toward distracted driving. These initial findings are then validated against an independent sample. If applied widely, this method may be applied to increase social pressure against distracted driving, leading to fewer people engaging in TWD behavior, and making roads safer.}

This paper explores the possibility of using surrogates to estimate crash modification factors. As in other situations where observational data are used to estimate causal effects, it is necessary to leverage background causal knowledge with the observational results. When the background knowledge is such that a crash-generating mechanism can be represented with a directed acyclic graph, the connectivity structure of the graph can be used to identify candidate surrogates. The modification factor associated with a safety-related improvement can then, in principle, be estimated from knowledge of how the improvement affects the surrogates, together with information on how the surrogates are distributed in the population of crashes. After developing this relationship between surrogates and crash modification factors, its potential usefulness is illustrated with two simulation studies, where estimates of CMFs using surrogates are compared to estimates computed from crash frequencies.}

To investigate the factors affecting behavior of mobile phone use while driving, 1106 respondents from four different regions in Thailand participated in the questionnaire survey study. Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) was used to explain these factors including two additional extended factors which are risk perception and law enforcement knowledge. The outcome of this part shows that attitude, norm, and law enforcement knowledge significantly affect the intention and behavior of the drivers. Even though approximately 90 percent of drivers realized that using a mobile phone while driving was dangerous and against the law, they have reported that they still use mobile phone while driving. To determine the effect of mobile phone use on driving performance, a 2-lane, straight rural highway, with a leading vehicle and an unexpected “STOP” sign, were simulated in order to examine the driving performance of drivers “without a phone”, “talking on a phone call”, and “texting a message” conditions. The results found that using mobile phone while driving can reduce speed and following distance, but increase lateral deviation, steer deviation, steer speed, perception-reaction time, and number of near misses leading to higher risks for road crashes.}

abstract = {Train related accidents, particularly derailments, can lead to severe consequences especially when they involve injuries or fatalities or when they involve hazardous materials that might result in environmental impacts. Whereas numerous road safety studies have suggested appropriate approaches to predicting vehicle-to-vehicle collisions, very few railway safety studies have considered predicting the number of derailments on rail tracks in North America. In addition, the existing few rail safety assessment and derailment prediction models have often been constrained by aggregated data limiting the safety assessments by, for example, failing to consider segment-level characteristics. This paper focused on the development of an integrated database for the development of a segment-level derailment prediction model for Canada’s rail network. The primary objective of this paper is to report how challenges in the data integration process were overcome and also to develop a network screening tool to identify segments with high derailment risk in Canada's rail network. Negative binomial regression and the Empirical Bayes technique were used to estimate the predicted number of derailments on Canada’s rail network at the segment level. A network screening process was then successfully applied to identify key segments of safety concern: the top ten segments of concern accounted for approximately 1% of the rail network allowing decision makers to focus their derailment mitigation efforts on a manageable part of Canada’s vast rail network. The data processing approach and analysis in this study have strong implications for advancing research on rail safety in North America.}

abstract = {Transportation safety is highly correlated with driving behavior, especially human error playing a key role in a large portion of crashes. Modern instrumentation and computational resources allow for the monitorization of driver, vehicle, and roadway/environment to extract leading indicators of crashes from multi-dimensional data streams. To quantify variations that are beyond normal in driver behavior and vehicle kinematics, the concept of volatility is applied. The study measures driver-vehicle volatilities using the naturalistic driving data. By integrating and fusing multiple real-time streams of data, i.e., driver distraction, vehicular movements and kinematics, and instability in driving, this study aims to predict occurrence of safety critical events and generate appropriate feedback to drivers and surrounding vehicles. The naturalistic driving data is used which contains 7566 normal driving events, and 1315 severe events (i.e., crash and near-crash), vehicle kinematics, and driver behavior collected from more than 3500 drivers. In order to capture the local dependency and volatility in time-series data 1D-Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and 1DCNN-LSTM are applied. Vehicle kinematics, driving volatility, and impaired driving (in terms of distraction) are used as the input parameters. The results reveal that the 1DCNN-LSTM model provides the best performance, with 95.45% accuracy and prediction of 73.4% of crashes with a precision of 95.67%. Additional features are extracted with the CNN layers and temporal dependency between observations is addressed, which helps the network learn driving patterns and volatile behavior. The model can be used to monitor driving behavior in real-time and provide warnings and alerts to drivers in low-level automated vehicles, reducing their crash risk.}

abstract = {Accurate detection of traffic accidents as well as condition analysis are essential to effectively restoring traffic flow and reducing serious injuries and fatalities. This goal can be obtained using an advanced data classification model with a rich source of traffic information. Several systems based on sensors and social networking platforms have been presented recently to detect traffic events and monitor traffic conditions. However, sensor-based systems provide limited information, and may fail owing to the long detection times and high false-alarm rates. In addition, social networking data are unstructured, unpredictable, and contain idioms, jargon, and dynamic topics. The machine learning algorithms utilized for traffic event detection might not extract valuable information from social networking data. In this paper, a social network–based, real-time monitoring framework is proposed for traffic accident detection and condition analysis using ontology and latent Dirichlet allocation (OLDA) and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM). First, the query-based search engine effectively collects traffic information from social networks, and the data preprocessing module transforms it into structured form. Second, the proposed OLDA-based topic modeling method automatically labels each sentence (e.g., traffic or non-traffic) to identify the exact traffic information. In addition, the ontology-based event recognition approach detects traffic events from traffic-related data. Next, the sentiment analysis technique identifies the polarity of traffic events employing user’s opinions, which helps determine accurate conditions of traffic events. Finally, the FastText model and Bi-LSTM with softmax regression are trained for traffic event detection and condition analysis. The proposed framework is evaluated using traffic-related data, comparing OLDA and Bi-LSTM with existing topic modeling methods and traditional classifiers using word embedding models, respectively. Our system outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves accuracy of 97 %. This finding demonstrates that the proposed system is more efficient for traffic event detection and condition analysis, in comparison to other existing systems.}

However, it is unclear how relevant the crash configurations in the standard are to present-day motorcycle crashes in Europe, the USA and other parts of the world. We analyzed recent in-depth crash data from Germany, India and China, examining powered two-wheeler (PTW) crash configurations in which at least one police-reported serious injury was present. After assessing the relevance of the ISO’s PTW crash configurations to those we found in each country, we suggested new configurations to guide the development of safety systems that would be more effective at reducing PTW-related fatalities and serious injuries. In all three databases, passenger cars were among the top two most frequent collision partners and a car front impacting the side of the PTW was the most common configuration. Notably, although collisions with trucks constituted the most common scenario in India and ground impact (primary collision) was a common scenario in both Germany and India, the ISO did not include either configuration. Further, in three of the seven ISO crash configurations, one of the collision partners is stationary, although stationary collision partners were rare in our data. Our results show that the ISO crash configurations do not represent the most frequent PTW road crashes in Germany, India or China. However, the Chinese database was confined to crashes with a collision partner with four or more wheels. Further, weighting factors for these data were not available, so we could not extrapolate the frequency of the Chinese crash configurations across the entire population. A revised version of the ISO could serve as a basis for a full-scale PTW crash test program. However, the observed differences between countries imply that a single global standard may not be feasible. To optimize the evaluation of a PTW safety system, we recommend the inclusion of configurations which are frequent in the region or country of interest—in addition to common configurations occurring frequently all around the world.}

abstract = {Reducing traffic fatal crashes has been an important mission of transportation. With the rapid development of sensor and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, the computer vision (CV)-based crash anticipation in the near-crash phase is receiving growing attention. The ability to perceive fatal crash risks in an early stage is of paramount importance as well because it can improve the reliability of crash anticipation. Yet this task is challenging because it requires establishing a relationship between the driving scene information that CV can recognize and the fatal crash features that CV will not get until the crash occurrence. Image data with the annotation for directly training a reliable AI model for the early visual perception of fatal crash risks are not abundant. The Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) contains big data on fatal crashes, which is a reliable data source for finding fatal crash clusters and discovering their distribution patterns to tell the association between driving scene characteristics and fatal crash features. To enhance CV's ability to perceive fatal crash risks earlier, this paper develops a data analytics model from fatal crash report data, which is named scenario-wise, spatio-temporal attention guidance. First, the paper identifies five descriptive variables that are sparse and thus allow for decomposing the 5-year (2013–2017) fatal crash dataset to develop scenario-wise attention guidance. Then, an exploratory analysis of location- and time-related descriptive variables suggests dividing fatal crashes into spatially defined groups. A group's temporal distribution pattern is an indicator of the similarity of fatal crashes in the group. Hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering further merge the spatially defined groups into six clusters according to the similarity of their temporal patterns. After that, association rule mining discovers the statistical relationship between the temporal information of driving scenes with fatal crash features, such as the first harmful event and the manner of collisions, for each cluster. The paper illustrates how the developed attention guidance supports the design and implementation of a preliminary CV model that can identify agents of a possibility to involve in fatal crashes from their environmental and context information.}

abstract = {Driving errors and violations are identified as contributing factors in most crash events. To examine the role of human factors and improve crash investigations, a systematic taxonomy of driver errors and violations (TDEV) is developed. The TDEV classifies driver errors and violations based on their occurrence during the theoretically based perception-reaction process and analyzes their contributions in safety critical events. To empirically explore errors and violations, made by drivers of instrumented vehicles, in diverse built environments, this study harnesses unique and highly detailed pre-crash sensor data collected in the Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS), containing 673 crashes, 1,331 near-crashes and 7,589 baselines (no-event). Human factors are categorized into recognition errors, decision errors, performance errors, and errors due to the drivers’ physical condition or their lack of contextual experience/familiarity, and intentional violations. In the NDS data, built environments (measured by roadway localities) are classified based on roadway functional classification and land uses, e.g., residential areas, school zones, and church zones. Based on the crash percentage to baseline percentage in a specific locality, interstates and open country/open residential (rural and semi-rural settings) may pose lower risks, while urban, business/industrial, and school zone locations showed higher crash risk. Human errors and violations by instrumented vehicle drivers contributed to 93% of the observed crashes, while roadway factors contributed to 17%, vehicle factors contributed in 1%, and 4% of crashes contained unknown factors. The most common human errors were recognition and decision errors, which occurred in 39% and 34% of crashes, respectively. These two error types occurred more frequently (each contributing to nearly 39% of crashes) in business or industrial land use environments (but not in dense urban localities). The findings of this study reveal continued prevalence of human factors in crashes. The distribution of driving errors and violations across different roadway environments can aid in the implementation of driver assistance systems and place-based interventions that can potentially reduce these driving errors and violations.}

Variable-length event periods are defined using both crash reports and nearby Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) and Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS) observations. Newly developed methods to extract precipitation-type beginning and ending times within ASOS/AWOS observations provide the most accurate account of precipitation type to compute CRREs. Crash relative risk is enhanced during any precipitation type, while a hierarchy of risk based on precipitation type is also evident. For property damage only crashes, CRREs during freezing rain are significantly higher than snow, which in turn are significantly higher than rain. CRREs during sleet, though statistically significantly higher than rain, are not statistically significantly different from snow or freezing rain. For casualty (injury and/or fatality) crashes, CRREs during snow and freezing rain are significantly higher than rain, but the increase in risk during sleet is not statistically significantly higher than rain. These results are consistent with expectations, but are quantified here for the first time. These hierarchies are insensitive to the use of all crashes versus only those with crash-reported precipitation or precipitation-induced roadway surface conditions to compute CRREs. The risk of a single-vehicle crash is higher than a multiple-vehicle crash during snow, sleet, and freezing rain, whereas the opposite was found for rain. This hierarchy is most prominent during weekdays before noon.}

This paper aims to inform behaviour change interventions to reduce ISA overriding targeted to drivers as they obtain vehicles fitted with ISA. We explore the beliefs underlying intentions to override ISA to exceed the speed limit in drivers with limited ISA experience using the Theory of Planned Behaviour. In a sample of 121 drivers (mean age 36 years), regression modelling showed that attitudes strongly predicted intentions with an additional contribution from subjective norms but not perceived behavioural control. Behavioural beliefs underlying attitudes addressed overriding ISA for (1) responsibly controlling the car to minimise crash risk and (2) reducing journey times and enjoying fast driving. Salient normative beliefs focussed on groups that would disapprove of overriding ISA including emergency services and parents. We discuss how these beliefs might be addressed in interventions to maximise the safe adoption of ISA.}

abstract = {The emergence of shared electric scooter (E-Scooter) systems offers a new micro-mobility mode in many urban areas worldwide. These systems have rapidly attracted numerous trips on various types of facilities such as sidewalks and bike lanes. After their burst of popularity, there are also growing safety concerns about E-Scooter riding. Consequently, a few cities have banned or temporarily suspended E-Scooters as severe crashes occurred. As an emerging micro-mobility mode, its safety performance is significantly understudied as compared to other travel modes such as cars and bicycles. The lack of crash records further prevents it from understanding the underlying mechanisms that drive the occurrences of E-Scooter crashes. The overarching goal of this paper is to probe the safety risk when riding E-Scooters. Specifically, it aims to study the interactions between e-scooter riding and the environment settings through naturalistic riding experiments. Rather than focusing on the analysis of individual riders’ heterogeneous behavior (e.g., swinging, hard braking, etc.) and rider characteristics (e.g., age, gender, etc.), the naturalistic riding study examines the riding process in different riding circumstances. A mobile sensing system has been developed to collect data for quantifying the surrogate safety metrics in terms of experienced vibrations, speed changes, and proximity to surrounding objects. The results from naturalistic riding experiments show that E-Scooters can experience notable impacts from different riding facilities. Specifically, compared to bicycle riding, more severe vibration events were associated with E-Scooter riding, regardless of the pavement types. Riding on concrete pavements was found to experience a multiple times higher frequency of vibration events when compared to riding on asphalt pavements of the same length. Riding on both sidewalks and vehicle lanes can both encounter high-frequency close contacts in terms of proximity with other objects. These experimental results suggest that E-Scooters are subject to increased safety challenges due to the increased vibrations, speed variations, and constrained riding environments.}

This study aims to comprehensively examine the influence of gender, age group, group-crossing, technological devices and carrying items on pedestrians crossing behaviors at signalized and unsignalized crosswalks simultaneously. Observational data of 552 pedestrians at two signalized and two unsignalized crosswalks in Tehran were collected. Temporal and spatial violations, conflict experience and collision avoidance, situational awareness, and pedestrians crossing speed were used as pedestrians crossing behaviors indicators. To model crossing behaviors, linear mixed models (LMMs) and Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) with fixed-effect approach were applied for the continuous outcome (pedestrians’ crossing speed) and binary outcomes, respectively. Phi and Cramer's V coefficients were used to avoid multicollinearity. Results showed that traffic checks before and while crossing showed a high positive correlation with crossing at “don’t walk” and flashing “don’t walk” signals and conflict experience at signalized crosswalks. As compared to females, males started their crossing more on flashing “don’t walk” signal and crossed the crosswalk faster. Older pedestrians exhibited more cautious behaviors at signalized intersections but less in unsignalized intersections. Alone pedestrians behaved more cautiously than groups and crossed the crosswalk more quickly. Using technological devices, regardless of their types, caused pedestrians to not exhibit one or more safe crossing indicators considered in this study. Pedestrians talking on their phones had the least cautious behaviors. Pedestrians listening to music mostly looked at the ground or straight direction rather than looking left-right for traffic. The findings from this study are a valuable resource to road authorities and policy makers to develop appropriate targeted strategies to prevent pedestrians’ injuries and fatalities and improve crosswalks safety.}

However, little is known about specific types of bicycling accidents – such as tramline-associated bicycling accidents (TABA) – that are potentially avoidable. This retrospective single center study of emergency department (ED) consultations analyzed TABA in the city of Bern, Switzerland. We analyzed the medical records of adult patients who presented to the ED after any bicycle accident. Patient and consultation characteristics were extracted. Incidence, important characteristics and ED resource consumption of TABA were compared with bicycle accidents that did not involve tramlines (BA). Furthermore, injury patterns and predictors of resource consumption were determined in TABA. We included a total of 298 TABA and 2351 BA over the 5.6-year study period. TABA accounted for 11.2 % of all bicycling accidents. Descriptive analysis revealed a significant increase between 2013 (lowest) and 2016 (highest) of 33.0 % in the total number of BA and 132 % in the total number of TABA. Compared to BA, TABA patients were significantly older, more often female, had a less urgent triage, and less often needed resuscitation bay treatment, hospitalization or ICU-admission (all p < 0.05). In multivariable analysis, TABA were associated with greater needs for ED resources. Most TABA injuries were to limbs (70.5 %) or the head (53.0 %), including intracranial hemorrhage (2.3 %). The radiological work-up consumed most of the resources (37.5 %), followed by physicians’ work (25.8 %). Statistically significant predictors of ED resource consumption in TABA were age, triage, resuscitation bay treatment, injuries to head/clavicle, and intoxication. One out of ten patients was intoxicated. Although TABA is associated with less severe trauma than BA, it bears the risk of significant morbidity and high ED resource needs. Intoxications contribute to this problem. Our findings underline the need for preventive measures to reduce TABA in the future.}

abstract = {With the emergence of connected vehicle (CV) technology, there is a doubt whether CVs can improve driver intentions and behaviors, and thus protect them from accidents with the provision of real-time information. In order to understand the possible impacts of the real-time information provided by CV technology on drivers, this paper aims to develop a model which considers the heterogeneity between drivers with the aid of the extended theory of planned behavior. At the uncontrolled non-signalized intersections, a stated preference (SP) questionnaire survey was conducted to build the dataset consisting of 1001 drivers. Based on the collected dataset, the proposed model examines the relationships between subjective norms, attitudes, risk perceptions, perceived behavioral control and driving intentions, and studies how such driving intentions are simultaneously related to driver characteristics and experiences in the CV environment. Furthermore, driver groups which are homogenous with respect to personality traits are formed, and then are employed to analyze the heterogeneity in responses to driving intentions. Four key findings are obtained when analyzing driver responses to the real-time information provided by CV technology: 1) the proposed H-ETPB model is verified with a good fitness measure; 2) irrespective to driver personality traits, attitudes and perceived behavioral control have a direct and indirect association with driving intentions to accelerate; 3) driving intentions of high-neurotic drivers to accelerate are significantly related to subjective norms, while that of low-neurotic drivers are not; 4) elder high-neurotic drivers, and low-neurotic drivers who have unstable salaries or ever joined in online car hailing service have a strong intention in accelerating. The findings of this study could provide the theoretical framework to optimize traffic performance and information design, as well as provide in-vehicle personalized information service in the CV and CAV environments and assist traffic authorities to design the most acceptable traffic rules for different drivers at an uncontrolled non-signalized intersection.}

abstract = {Two-stage crossing with a median refuge island is commonly installed at the busy urban signalized intersections. To accommodate for the high traffic flow in different directions, split phasing is often applied for pedestrians’ right of way of the two crossing stages. Previous studies mainly focus on the time delay, capacity and operation efficiency of two-stage crossings. It is rare that safety of two-stage crossings is investigated. Crossing behaviors and propensities of red light running at the two crossing stages (i.e. from the curbside to a central island, and then to another side of the road) are different from that of single stage crossing. Also, there could be interferences in the crossing behaviors and situational features between the two stages. This study aims to identify the personal characteristics, traffic attributes and environmental factors that affect the red light running propensities of pedestrians at the two-stage crossings, based on the video observation surveys at six urban signal intersections in Hong Kong. Random parameter logit regression approach is applied to measure the association between possible factors and propensities of red light running of pedestrians, with which the effect of unobserved heterogeneity is accounted. Results indicate that, other than the pedestrians’ characteristics, pedestrian signal of the second stage, maximum waiting time and traffic flow significantly affect the propensity of red light running in the first stage. Also, there are significant interaction effects between pedestrians’ characteristics and situational features on the propensity. On the other hand, pedestrians’ waiting time before crossing the first stage significantly affects the propensity of red light running in the second stage. Findings are indicative to the design of pedestrian crossing, signal time plan and effective enforcement and education strategies that can deter against the red light running behaviors of pedestrians. Therefore, safety of two-stage signalized crossings can be enhanced.}

abstract = {A key goal of driver training is to teach drivers to avoid crashes. However, in traditional driver training, drivers are unlikely to see even a single example of the class of event that we want them to learn to avoid. We developed a six-session automated online hazard perception training course for drivers, which incorporates a range of evidence-based strategies and employs extensive video footage of real crashes. We evaluated this course in a randomized control trial by examining its effects on previously-validated computer-based measures of hazard perception, hazard prediction, speed choice, following distance, and gap acceptance propensity, as well as self-rated measures of driver skill, safety, and real world transfer. We found that the course resulted in significant improvements in hazard perception response time and hazard prediction scores, and significantly longer vehicle following distances. Additionally, all participants in the trained group reported that their real world driving behaviour had improved. No significant training effects were found for the other measures. The results suggest that the course can improve key behaviours associated with crash risk.}

abstract = {Objective
To quantify the total number and cost of crashes, fatalities, and injuries that could be addressed by improved conspicuity of disabled vehicles to approaching traffic.
Methods
Using the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) and the Crash Report Sampling System (CRSS) this study defines three crash scenarios where insufficient conspicuity of a disabled vehicle (“low conspicuity emergency”) resulted in injury or death: Scenario 1) Moving vehicle strikes non-moving vehicle following an initial event; Scenario 2) Pedestrian (primarily a motorist who has exited their vehicle) is struck while tending to a disabled or stopped vehicle; and Scenario 3) A vehicle departs the roadway and crashes unnoticed and rescue initiation is delayed significantly.
Results
Annually, between the years 2016 and 2018, an estimated 71,693 people were involved in low conspicuity emergency events, including 566 fatalities and 14,371 injuries. Most (95 %) of these cases occurred under scenario 1. Notable, however, is the severity of scenario 2 crashes where the majority were severely injured (22 %) or killed (19 %). Based on the FARS data, nearly 300 people were killed under scenario 2 each year and cases have increased 27 % since 2014. Overall, crashes under these three scenarios resulted in an annual estimated $8.8 billion in societal costs, including the economic costs of medical payments and wage loses in addition to the value of quality of life lost due to death or disability. Scenario 1 crashes resulted in an average of $4.3 billion in losses, scenario 2 crashes in $3.4 billion in losses, and scenario 3 crashes in $1.2 billion in losses annually.
Conclusions
A significant number of people die or are injured in low conspicuity events every year; an estimated 1.55 deaths and nearly 40 injuries per day. This analysis highlights the risks to a special subset of pedestrians: motorists who exited their vehicles to attend to a disabled or stopped vehicle. These deaths and injuries that result from crashes related to low-conspicuity events are preventable. Countermeasures to reduce the incidence and severity of the crash scenarios studied should be explored.}

This study utilized an unsupervised learning method, known as factor analysis, on a unique distracted driving dataset to understand PUWD behavior from the roadway geometry and operational perspectives. The results indicate that the presence of a shoulder, median, and access control on the relatively higher functional class roadways could encourage more PUWD events. The roadways with relatively lower speed limits could have high PUWD event occurrences if the variation in operating speed is high. The results also confirm the correlations between the frequency of PUWD events and the frequency of distracted crashes. This relationship is strong on urban roadways. For rural roadways, this correlation is only strong on the roadways with a large amount of PUWD events. The findings could help transportation agencies to identify suitable countermeasures in reducing distraction related crashes. Moreover, this study provides researchers a new perspective to study PUWD behavior rather than only focus on drivers' personalities.}

The data came from a case-control relative risk study collected from Virginia Beach, VA, over a 20-month period. Data collectors gathered driver information from the scene of vehicle crashes and, in some cases, from hospitals. Non-crash controls were sampled from the same locations, days, and times as crashes. Key data items included driver demographics and oral fluid and blood samples, which were assayed for licit and illicit drugs. We found no overall association between cannabis use and risk of crash involvement. However, when age and age2 were allowed to interact with THC, significant interaction effects emerged. THC was associated with increased risk of crash involvement for older drivers. Difference between THC-positive and sober drivers emerged as significant at age 64. The research underscores the value of examining drugged driving in the context of driver age. Age-related declines in neurocognitive and psychomotor functioning were not measured but might be important in explaining the results.}

As AV’s market penetration increases, the interactions between conventional vehicles and AVs are inevitable but by no means clear. This study aims to create new knowledge by quantifying the behavioral changes caused when conventional human-driven vehicles follow AVs and investigating the impact of these changes (if any) on safety and the environment. This study analyzes data obtained from a field experiment by Texas A\&M University to evaluate the effects of AVs on the behavior of a following human-driver. The dataset is comprised of nine drivers that attempted to follow 5 speed-profiles, with two scenarios per profile. In scenario one, a human-driven vehicle follows an AV that implements a human driver speed profile (base). In scenario two, the human-driven vehicle follows an AV that executes an AV speed profile. In order to evaluate safety, these scenarios are compared using time-to-collision (TTC) and several other driving volatility measures. Likewise, fuel consumption and emissions are used to investigate environmental impacts. Overall, the results show that AVs in mixed traffic streams can induce behavioral changes in conventional vehicle drivers, with some beneficial effects on safety and the environment. On average, a driver that follows an AV exhibits lower driving volatility in terms of speed and acceleration, which represents more stable traffic flow behavior and lower crash risk. The analysis showed a remarkable improvement in TTC as a result of the notably better speed adjustments of the following vehicle (i.e., lower differences in speeds between the lead and following vehicles) in the second scenario. Furthermore, human-driven vehicles were found to consume less fuel and produce fewer emissions on average when following an AV.}

abstract = {Traffic congestion is monotonically increasing, especially in large cities, due to rapid urbanization. Traffic congestion not only deteriorates traffic operation and degrades traffic safety, but also imposes costs to the road users. The concerns associated with traffic congestion increase when considering more complicated situations such as unsignalized intersections and driveways at which maneuvers are entirely dependent upon drivers’ judgment. Urban arterials are characterized by closely spaced signalized and unsignalized intersections and high traffic volumes, which make them a priority while analyzing traffic safety and operation. Autonomous Vehicles (AV) provide ample opportunities to overcome the aforementioned challenges. In essence, this study evaluates the impact of various AV Market Penetration Rates (MPR) on the safety and operation of urban arterials in proximity of a driveway under different traffic levels of service (LOS). Twenty-four separate scenarios were developed using VISSIM, considering six AV MPRs of 0 %, 10 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 %, and 100 %, and four LOS including A, B, C, and D. Various operational and safety measures were analyzed including traffic density, traffic speed, traffic conflict (rear-end and lane-changing), and driving volatility. The trajectory and lane-based analysis of the traffic density indicates that MPR significantly improves the overall traffic density for all the scenarios, especially under high traffic LOS. Additionally, by increasing the MPR and decreasing the traffic volume of the network, the mean speed increases significantly by up to 6 %. Exploring the safety of the scenarios indicates that by increasing the MPR from 0% to 100 % for all the LOS, the number of rear-end conflicts and lane-changing conflicts decreases 84 %–100 % and 42 %–100 %, respectively. Moreover, assessing the longitudinal driving volatility measures, which represent risky driving behaviors, showed that higher MPRs significantly reduce some of the driving volatility measures and enhance safety.}

We screened 7460 records of which 60 studies (1,012,041 pedestrians) were included in the review. Injured pedestrians 60+ compared to those <60 were found to have a higher relative risk of severe injury (pooled relative risk RR 1.6, 95 % CI: 1.4–2.0 p < 0.001), critical care admission (pooled RR 1.5, 95 %CI: 1.3–1.8 p < 0.001), and fatality (pooled RR of 3.7, 95 % CI: 3.0–4.5 p < 0.001). Pedestrians 60+ also had higher incidence rates of pedestrian falls causing higher injury severity. GRADE was used to evaluate evidence quality, with the results suggesting that the overall quality of the evidence supporting these findings was low. Further research is needed to understand health risks associated with older pedestrian trauma and to develop effective risk management strategies.}

Driving measures are frequently collapsed to summary levels across the study period, excluding more fine-grained differences such as changes that occur from trip to trip. By retaining trip-specific data, it is possible to quantify how much a driver differs from trip to trip (within-person variability) in addition to how he or she differs from other drivers (between-person variability). To the authors’ knowledge, the current study is the first to use multilevel modeling to quantify variability in distracted driving behavior in a naturalistic dataset of older drivers. The current study demonstrates the utility of examining within-person variability in a naturalistic driving dataset of 68 older drivers across two weeks. First, multilevel models were conducted for three distracted driving behaviors to distinguish within-person variability from between-person variability in these behaviors. A high percentage of variation in distracted driving behaviors was attributable to within-person differences, indicating that drivers’ behaviors varied more across their own driving trips than from other drivers (ICCs = .93). Then, to demonstrate the utility of personal characteristics in predicting daily driving behavior, a hypothetical model is presented using simulated daily sleep duration from the previous night to predict distracted driving behavior the following day. The current study demonstrates substantial variability in driving behaviors within an older adult sample and the promise of individual characteristics to provide better prediction of driving behaviors relevant to safety, which can be applied in investigations of current naturalistic driving datasets and in designing future studies.}

Nowadays, in the context of mobility as a service, organized carpooling encompasses a service and trust relationship between drivers and passengers, by matching common routes and splitting cost through mobile phone applications. Therefore, passengers expect a certain level of travel quality and safety. In this context, this research aims to verify the hypothesis that drivers in an organized carpooling situation (CP) show safer driving behavior in terms of speeding (SP) and mobile phone use while driving (MPU) in comparison with non-carpooling (NCP) drivers. The research is based on data from the Brazilian Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS-BR) conducted in the City of Curitiba, with 40.45 driving hours and a traveled distance of 895.87 km. Methodology included the selection of safety performance indicators on SP and MPU, use of nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test for safety performance indicator comparisons and Pearson Chi-Square to test the association between CP or NCP and low or high indicator values. Hypothesis test results point in the same direction and partially confirm the initial assumption that CP induces safer behavior in terms of speeding. The statistically sound results showed that CP drivers engaged in less speeding episodes and mobile phone use duration in comparison to NCP drivers, as well as lower speed while using a mobile phone. In addition, driver behavior in CP and NCP situations also differed in terms of the type of MPU, with the proportion of types of use that demand a higher level of visual and manual distraction being higher among NCP drivers. In summary, these results confirm the initial hypothesis of safer driving behavior during carpooling in terms of MPU while driving.}

Among the various causes of crashes on horizontal curves, wet-weather skidding is a major contributing factor. This study analyzed the mechanisms of three possible modes of vehicle skidding on horizontal curves based on theories of mechanics. The three modes of skidding analyzed were: (i) forward skidding of front steering wheel, (ii) sideway skidding of front steering wheel, and (iii) sideway skidding of rear wheel. The main objective was to provide useful information to researchers and practitioners in identifying the important factors that contribute to horizontal curve crashes. A computer simulation procedure was developed to evaluate the maximum safe vehicle speeds against the three modes of skidding on wet horizontal curved pavements. This offers a much improved method for skidding potential evaluation compared to the conventional approximate method using estimated coefficient of friction. The skidding potential of a vehicle is defined as the difference between its speed and the maximum safe speed against skidding. The smaller the difference, the higher is the skidding potential. The relative magnitudes of skidding potential for the three skidding modes were considered for different operating conditions. Different operating conditions were represented by different values of pavement curve radii, super-elevations, and wet-weather conditions represented by the thickness of pavement surface water-film. The analysis identified five key factors that affect the skidding potential of vehicles negotiating a horizontal curve. They are: vehicle speed, curve radius, superelevation, water film thickness and pavement skid resistance state.}

E-scooter regulations vary widely among jurisdictions, with likely effects on the extent and nature of safety issues. This study was conducted in downtown Brisbane, Australia, where e-scooters must be ridden on the footpath, bicycles are allowed on the road and the footpath, and helmet use is mandatory for bicycle and e-scooter riders of all ages. It examined involvement in illegal and risky behaviours, and interactions with pedestrians. Shared and private e-scooters, and shared and private bicycles were compared to assess the relative influences of type of vehicle and shared use. Observations at six sites in downtown Brisbane in February 2019 recorded 711 shared e-scooters, 90 private e-scooters, 274 shared bicycles and 2788 private bicycles. Illegal riding (not wearing a helmet, riding on the road, or carrying a passenger) was more prevalent among shared than private e-scooters (49.6 % vs. 12.2 %). Non-use of helmets was more common among riders of shared e-scooters (38.6 %, OR = 20.995, p < .001) and shared bicycles (18.8 %, OR = 10.994, p < .001) than private bicycles (1.5 %); occurred more often on the footpath than the road (20.1 % vs. 1.8 %, OR = 3.004, p < .001); and occurred more between 2 and 4 pm than between 7 and 9a.m. (21.3 % vs. 5.5 %, OR = 1.711, p < .01). More than 90 % of e-scooters, about half of shared bicycles and about a quarter of private bicycles were ridden on the footpath, with about 40 % within 1 m of at least one pedestrian. When there were pedestrians within 1 m, conflict rates ranged from zero to 1.5 % and no collisions were observed. At least for helmet non-use, the results suggest that risky behaviours are more prevalent among users of shared schemes, and that this difference is accentuated for e-scooters. Interactions with pedestrians are common but conflicts rarely occur in footpath riding. Further observational and survey studies are recommended to better understand the factors influencing the perceptions and behaviours of shared and private e-scooters and pedestrians. The knowledge gained from these studies needs to be integrated with injury outcome data to determine the appropriateness of rules for maximum speeds and locations of riding in terms of both rider and pedestrian safety.}

We employed a scoping review methodology to identify the approaches used in the literature to quantify AV safety. After screening and reviewing the literature, six approaches were identified: target crash population, traffic simulation, driving simulator, road test data analysis, system failure risk assessment, and safety effectiveness estimation. We ran two evaluations on the identified approaches. First, we investigated each approach in terms of its input (required data, assumptions, etc.), output (safety evaluation metrics), and application (to estimate AVs' safety implications at the vehicle, transportation system, and society levels). Second, we qualitatively compared them in terms of three criteria: availability of input data, suitability for evaluating different automation levels, and reliability of estimations. This review identifies four challenges in AV safety evaluation: (a) shortcomings in AV safety evaluation approaches, (b) uncertainties in AV implementations and their impacts on AV safety, (c) potential riskier behavior of AV passengers as well as other road users, and (d) emerging safety issues related to AV implementations. This review is expected to help researchers and rulemakers to choose the most appropriate quantification method based on their goals and study limitations. Future research is required to address the identified challenges in AV safety evaluation.}

Child pedestrian injury primarily occurs in urban areas, with a significant share at crosswalks. The aim of this study is to explore whether an intervention programme based on the theory of “behaviour spectrums” can improve the street-crossing skills of primary school children. Children were recruited near a local primary school through invitation letters and were randomly divided into two groups: a control group (n = 10, no intervention) and an experimental group (n = 10, intervention). The children in the experimental group received 30−45 min of training. The child participants were asked to wear an eye tracker and performed a crossing test in a real-world street environment; in this test, they were required to successively pass through an unsignalised intersection, an unsignalised T-intersection and a signalised intersection on a designated test route. A high-definition camera was used to record the children’s crossing behaviour, and the Tobii Pro Glasses 2 eye tracker was used to derive indicators of the children’s visual behaviour in the areas of interest (AOIs) in the street. The evaluation was conducted on children’s crossing behaviour in the control group (which received no intervention) and the experimental group (tested at two time points after the intervention: children tested immediately after the intervention and children retested one month after the intervention). The results showed that compared with the control group, the children in the experimental group no longer focused on the small area around the body (e.g., the zebra crossing area) and the area in front of the eyes (e.g., the sidewalk area), which increased their visual attention to the traffic areas on the left and right sides of the zebra crossing; thus, unsafe crossing behaviour was reduced in the experimental group. Compared with the experimental group immediately after the intervention, the intervention effect on some indicators showed a significant weakening trend in the retest of the experimental group one month later. Overall, the results show that an intervention programme based on the theory of “behaviour spectrums” can improve children’s crossing skills. This study provides valuable information for the development and evaluation of intervention programmes to improve children’s street-crossing skills.}

abstract = {Interactive pedestrian simulators have become a valuable research tool for investigating street-crossing behavior and developing solutions for improving pedestrian safety. There are two main kinds of pedestrian simulators: one uses a technology based on rear-projection screens (Cave Automatic Virtual Environment, or CAVE), the other a head-mounted display (HMD). These devices are used indiscriminately, regardless of the research objective, and it is not yet known whether they are equally effective for studying street crossing. The present study was aimed at comparing the street crossing behavior and subjective evaluations of younger and older adult pedestrians when they are using a CAVE-like or HMD-based (HTC Vive Pro) pedestrian simulator. Thirty younger adults and 25 older adults performed 36 street-crossing trials (combining different speeds, two-way traffic conditions, and gap sizes) on each of the two types of simulators. The results indicated that participants in the HMD condition crossed the street significantly more often (58.6 %) than in the CAVE condition (42.44%) and had shorter safety margins. The most striking difference pertained to crossing initiation, which occurred considerably earlier (1.78 s) in the HMD condition than in the CAVE condition. Synchronization of crossing initiation with oncoming traffic was not as good in the CAVE condition because visual information in front of the pedestrian was missing due to the absence of ground projection. In both simulators, older adults caused more collisions than did younger ones, had shorter safety margins, and a slower crossing speed. Hence, the HMD reproduced classical age-related differences in most street-crossing behaviors already found on the CAVE. Usually observed speed effects were also found for both simulators. Neither cybersickness nor any adverse effects on stereoacuity or postural balance were found for either simulator. The HMD produced a higher level of presence and preference than the CAVE did. These findings provide evidence that HMDs have a clear potential for studying pedestrian behaviour.}

This comparison approach is important to account for other influences on crashes over time, but has limited ability to determine which GLS components are most effective and at what stage during the licensing process. We previously identified declines in young driver crashes in Queensland, Australia, following introduction of a new GLS in 2007. The objective of the current research was to conduct complementary modelling to identify at what points through the licensing process had particular GLS policies contributed to reductions. Crash trends were explored for learner and provisional drivers under the new GLS versus previous system for three time periods relative to the month of acquiring a provisional licence: the preceding learner period, the first month of provisional licensure (when crashes typically peak), and the overall provisional period. Interrupted time series analyses were conducted for the log ratio of crashes per 10,000 licensed (learner and provisional) drivers with the total number of licensed drivers as an offset. The greatest declines were found in the first month of licensure, with indications that a longer learner period, higher supervised driving hours, and a new provisional night-passenger restriction were key contributors to provisional crash reductions. There was also some indication that a restriction on all phone use reduced crashes during the learner period. We conclude that time series analysis focusing on licensing stage, rather than calendar time only, offers a complementary approach to analysing GLS effectiveness by better identifying where and how changes impact crashes.}

From 2015–2019, there were 57 HRGC crashes at crossings in East Baton Rouge Parish (EBRP), resulting in thirteen injuries with $346,875 cost of vehicle damages. Consolidation programs help to close redundant crossings and thereby decrease the crash risks; however, it is difficult to find the best crossing in a neighborhood for closure. In our previous research working on HRGC consolidation models in 2019, from among four Machine Learning algorithms, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGboost) performed better in HRGC prediction models. In continuation of our previous studies on developing a HRGC prediction model, this research employed Text Mining Techniques, and Geospatial Analysis in addition to the XGboost Machine Learning algorithm. The aim was to develop a consolidation model that is customized for local implementation. The results indicated an overall accuracy of 88 % for the proposed model. The relative importance of the variables input to the model was also reported and offers an in-depth understanding of the model’s behavior. Considering the different correlation threshold, a sensitivity analysis was also performed on different aggregation gain values. Subsequently, it resulted in the development of a simplified model utilizing 14 variables, with aggregated gain values of 95 % and a correlation threshold of 0.5. Based on this model, 15 % of current highway-rail grade crossings should be closed.}

Research results show that face consciousness with Chinese characteristics can significantly affect parents’ intentions. Knowledge of AVs is the most significant factor in influencing parents’ intentions. Perceived usefulness, attitude towards school travel in AVs, and perceived risk can significantly affect parents’ intentions. The direct impact of perceived ease of use and public engagement on parents’ intentions is not significant. Finally, this research could provide decision-making support for governments and manufacturers to formulate relevant policies and marketing strategies, promoting parents’ acceptance of AVs.}

The emerging Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technologies are expected to bring substantial improvements in ramp merging operations in general, including the possibility to reduce traffic conflicts and crashes by partially or fully eliminating the critical factors related to the human drivers. In order to investigate the potential safety impacts of AVs at on-ramp merging, this study first proposes a novel conflict index in theory as a specific indicator for ramp merging safety. Then, a merging conflict model is introduced to estimate the index value in various cases by considering the interactions between the mainline and ramp vehicles. In order to account for real-world uncertainties and variations in various crash-contributing factors, the proposed approach incorporates Monte-Carlo method and probabilistic distributions calibrated on the empirical freeway data. The developed approach is later applied in a case study with incremental AV market penetration rates to investigate AV safety impacts at on-ramp merging. The results show clear benefits of AVs in reducing the frequency and severity of the critical merging events. In addition, a sensitivity analysis on essential model parameters shows that the merging safety of AVs is closely related to their gap acceptance policy and the proper functioning of the driving systems, providing further insights into the future development of AVs.}

Although proactive traffic management systems have been supported heavily in the research community, and autonomous vehicles (AVs) are soon to become a reality, analyses are concentrated on very specific environments using aggregated data. This study aims at investigating –for the first time- rear-end conflict frequency in an urban network level using vehicle-to-vehicle interactions and at correlating frequency with the corresponding network traffic state. The Time-To-Collision (TTC) and Deceleration Rate to Avoid Crash (DRAC) metrics are utilized to estimate conflict frequency on the current network situation, as well as on scenarios including AV characteristics. Three critical conflict points are defined, according to TTC and DRAC thresholds. After extracting conflicts, data are fitted into Zero-inflated and also traditional Negative Binomial models, as well as quasi-Poisson models, while controlling for endogeneity, in order to investigate contributory factors of conflict frequency. Results demonstrate that conflict counts are significantly higher in congested traffic and that high variations in speed increase conflicts. Nevertheless, a comparison with simulated AV traffic and the use of more surrogate safety indicators could provide more insight into the relationship between traffic state and traffic conflicts in the near future.}

This study aimed to explore the influencing factors of red light running behavior and identify the differences between the DEB riders and the ordinary e-bike (OEB) riders to aid the development of countermeasures. In this study, the mixed (random parameter) binary logistic model was employed to capture the effects of unobserved heterogeneity. With this approach, factors including individual characteristics, behavioral variables, characteristics of signalized intersections, and the traffic environment were examined. Additionally, to account for the combined influence on the RLR occurrence, mixed logit framework was developed to reveal the correlations among the random parameters. The data of e-bike riders’ crossing behaviors at four signalized intersections in Xi'an, China were collected, and 3335 samples were recorded. The results indicated showed that DEB riders are more likely to run red lights than OEB riders. Factors that affect RLR behaviors of the two groups are different. Factors associated with the unobserved heterogeneity include red-light stage, observation time, age and waiting position of the rider. The joint influence among random parameters further illustrates the complexity of the contributing factors of riders’ crossing behavior. Results from the models provide insights into the development of intervention systems to improve the traffic safety of e-bike riders at intersections.}

We conducted human-in-the-loop experiments with 24 participants. In the experiment, a human operator and an autonomy module for navigation shared the control of a simulated notional High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) at a fixed speed. At the same time, the human operator performed a target detection task. The autonomy could be either adaptive or non-adaptive to the above-mentioned human factors. Results indicate that the adaptive haptic control scheme resulted in significantly lower workload, higher trust in autonomy, better driving task performance and smaller control effort.}

Alternatively, the surrogate safety measure (SSMs) based approach that can assess traffic safety by capturing the more frequent “near-crash” situations have been developed, but it is criticized for the potential sampling and measurement errors. This study proposes a new safety performance measure—Risk Status (RS), by fusing crash data and SSMs. Real-world connected vehicle data collected in the Safety Pilot Model Deployment (SPMD) project in Ann Arbor, Michigan is used to extract SSMs. With RS treated as a latent variable, a structural equation model with conditional autoregressive spatial effect and corridor-level random parameters is developed to model the interrelationship among RS, crash frequency, risk identified by SSMs, and contributing factors. The modeling results confirm the proposed interrelationship and the necessity to account for both spatial autocorrelation and unobserved heterogeneity. RS can integrate both crash frequency and SSMs together while controlling for observed and unobserved factors. RS is found to be a more reliable criterion for safety assessment in an implementation case of hotspot identification.}

The prevalence of traffic violations was higher for males (19.2 %) vs females (9.9 %) and middle (16.2 %) and late (19.4 %) EAs vs early (8.8 %) EAs. The odds of reporting traffic violations were higher for EAs who engaged in habitual [OR = 1.77 (1.17–2.67)] or casual [OR = 1.79 (1.27−2.51)] cannabis use when compared to non-users. Age moderated the association such that higher odds of traffic violations were reported in early EAs who were casual cannabis users and middle EAs who were habitual or casual cannabis users when compared to non-users. Use of other drugs was also a moderator—in the absence vs. presence of other drug use, odds of traffic violations were higher in those who engaged in either habitual or casual use of cannabis. When accounting for the moderating effects of age and drug use, habitual and casual cannabis use resulted in increased odds of a traffic violation. Future research is warranted to explore the robustness of our findings.}

abstract = {There is an increased interest in the use of traffic conflicts as a surrogate safety measure and several traffic conflict indicators have been developed. One of these indicators is the deceleration rate to avoid a crash (DRAC). Generally, the greater the DRAC value, the higher the crash risk and a crash would occur when the DRAC exceeds the maximum available deceleration rate (MADR). It is noted that the MADR varies considerably for individual vehicles and depends on many factors such as the pavement conditions, vehicle weight, tire, and the braking system. Previous studies usually either set a specific value for the MADR or randomly sample values from a truncated normal distribution of MADR. However, little is known about which threshold determination approach is better. Therefore, this study aims to compare the threshold determination approaches for DRAC-based crash estimation applying Bayesian hierarchical extreme value modeling. Using traffic conflict and crash data collected from four signalized intersections in the city of Surrey, several Bayesian hierarchical models are developed for five specific values of MADR and values from two truncated normal distributions of MADR. The crash frequencies estimated from these models were compared with observed crashes. The results show that, in terms of DRAC-based crash estimation accuracy, the truncated normal distribution N(8.45, 1.42)I(4.23, 12.68) of MADR outperforms other determination methods of MADR. Moreover, in terms of DRAC-based crash estimation accuracy and precision, the use of multisite Bayesian hierarchical models outperforms the at-site models. The truncated normal distribution N(8.45, 1.42)I(4.23, 12.68) of MADR is therefore recommended for DRAC-based crash estimation.}

Tremendous previous studies have conducted relevant analysis with econometric modeling approaches, whereas the ability of non-parametric methods to predict crash severity is still smattering of knowledge. Consequently, the main objective of this paper is to conduct single-vehicle crash severity prediction with different tree-based and non-parameter models. An alternate aim is to identify the intrinsic mechanism of how contributing factors determine single-vehicle crash severity. By virtue of Grid-Search method, this paper conducted fine-tuning of different models to obtain the best performances based on five crash severity sub-datasets. For model evaluation, the accuracy indicators were calculated in training, validation and test sets, respectively. Besides, feature importance extraction was undertaken based on the results of model comparison. The finding indicated that these models didn’t exhibit a huge performance difference for crash severity prediction in the same severity level; however, the performances of the models did vary among different datasets, with an average training accuracy of 99.27 %, 96.4 %, 86.98 %, 86.84 %, 71.76 % in fatal injury, severe injury, visible injury, complaint of pain, PDO crash datasets, respectively. Additionally, it was found that in each severity dataset, the indicator urban freeways is a determinant factor that leads to the occurrence of crashes while rural freeways is more related to more severe crashes (i.e., fatal and severe crashes). This paper can provide valuable information for model selection and tuning in accident severity prediction. Future research could consider the influences that temporal instability of contributing features has on the model performances.}

There is, however, uncertainty about the consequences of implementing curbside rather than layby stops for traffic collision risks. To begin investigating this issue, we describe an exploratory analysis in which national data describing bus stops, road properties, traffic collisions and built-up areas were merged based on geographical location. Analysis of the resulting data set suggests that the relative rates of traffic collisions resulting in personal injury within 60 m of the bus stop, is higher for curbside than for layby stops in built-up areas (0.32 vs. 0.22 collisions per ten million passing vehicles, respectively). Our analyses suggest that the higher risk of nearby collisions for curbside stops is not necessarily due to bus stop design, but rather because they tend to be located closer to junctions and side roads, where collisions are more likely. Our data are not consistent with hypotheses that curbside stops are associated with greater shares of head-on or rear-end collisions than layby stops, nor that layby stops are associated with greater shares of side-on collisions than curbside stops. The limitations of this exploratory analysis, and of the use of national-level data for studying the effects of bus stop design on collision risk, are related to lack of control of bus stop design features other than curbside vs. layby, statistical power, data registration and compromises made when coupling data based on geographical location. Future work should attempt to build on our approach, and supplement database analyses with analysis of in-depth reports of bus stop collisions, observations of road user conflicts near bus stops, and before-after studies following conversion from layby to curbside stops or from curbside to layby stops.}

As it stands, road injuries are ranked among top-ten leading causes of death by the World Health Organization. Distracted driving is defined as an attention diversion of the driver toward a competing activity. It was shown in numerous studies that distracted driving increase the probability of near-crash or crash events. By leveraging the statistical power of the large SHRP2 naturalistic data, we are able to quantify the preponderance of specific distractions during daily trips and confirm the causality factor of an ubiquitous non-driving task in the crash event. We show that, except for phone usage which happens more frequently in near-crash and crash categories than in baseline trips, both distracted driving and secondary tasks occur almost uniformly in different types of trips. In this study, we investigate the impact of the co-occurrence of distracted driving with other driving behaviors and secondary tasks. It is found that the co-occurrence of distracted driving with other driving behaviors or secondary tasks increase the chance of near-crash and crash events. This study's findings can inform the design and development of more precise and reliable driving assistance and warning systems.}

The Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) is applied to supplement and improve the framework. Next, under this framework, we identify the risk factors in traffic accident record, and analyze the statistical characteristics from the level of risk sources and risk characteristics. Then, the concept of accident liability weight is proposed to measure the impact of risk factors on accident occurrence. Through the liability affirmation of risk factors, the accident probability are updated. Last, we establish an accident risk quantify model (ARQM) based on the mean mutual information to compare the likelihood of accidents in different scenarios. In addition, we compare the accident probability and risk under equivalent liability and liability affirmation, as well as give some fundamental ideas regarding how to effectively prevent accidents.}

The present study aimed to validate a pedestrian behavior questionnaire in Iran to investigate Persian pedestrian behaviors and to understand the relationship of these behaviors with demographic and mobility variables. A total of 520 participants (292 males and 228 females) completed a survey containing behavioral items and demographic questions. A principal component analysis showed that the data best fit in four factors of transgressions (including violations and errors), lapses, aggressive behaviors, and positive behaviors. In this study, the association of behavioral dimensions with crash history as a driver, crash history as a pedestrian, the severity of an experienced pedestrian-related crash, and the participant’s relative’s crash history as a pedestrian were also investigated. The present study confirms that PBQ is a useful tool with adequate reliability for investigating Persian pedestrians' safety-related behaviors. These findings revealed the need for intervention programs and improving infrastructures through the evaluation of pedestrian behaviors, which may lead to decreasing pedestrian-related crash frequency.}

Therefore, it is of paramount importance to identify the possible factors that may affect the bicycle crash risk. However, reliable estimates of bicycle exposure are often not available for the safety risk evaluation of different entities. The objective of this study is to advance the estimation of exposure in the bicycle safety analysis, using the detailed origin-destination data of each trip of the London public bicycle rental system. Two approaches including shortest path method (SPM) and weighted shortest path method (WSPM) are proposed to model the bicycle path choice and to estimate the bicycle distance traveled (BDT). Then, the bicycle crash frequency models that adopt BDTs as the exposure estimated using SPM and three WSPMs are developed. Three exposure measures including bicycle trips, bicycle time traveled (BTT), and BDT are assessed. Results indicate that the bicycle crash frequency models that incorporate the BDTs using WSPM have superior model fit. Moreover, the bicycle crash frequency model that incorporate the BDTs as the exposure outperforms those that incorporate the bicycle trips and BTT as the exposures. Findings of current study are indicative to the development of bicycle crash frequency model. Moreover, it should enhance the understanding on the roles of environmental, traffic and bicyclist factors in bicycle crash risk, based on appropriate estimates of bicycle exposures. Therefore, it should be useful to the transport planners and engineers for the development of bicycle infrastructures that can improve the overall bicycle safety in the long run.}

Four vehicles are analyzed as a discretionary lane-changing group, and both the distance-related and speed-related factors are taken into account to examine their dynamic effects. The modeling results indicate that (1) two distance-related variables produce significant random parameters with heterogeneity in means and variances, while there is only one speed-related variable having significant result for heterogeneity in means and variances; (2) the relationship between the speed of lane-changing vehicle and the heterogeneity in mean of vehicle clearance distance between leading vehicle in current lane and lane-changing vehicle quantitatively demonstrates that when the driver decides whether to change lanes, the driver considers the tradeoff between distance (i.e., safety) and speed (i.e., efficiency) at the same time; and (3) the number of significant variables is gradually decreased during the lane-changing decision-making process. It demonstrates that the lane-changing decision is a dynamic process where drivers gradually select more critical factors and pay more attention to them.}

Eighty-nine drivers were included in the study using a 2 × 2 design with the conditions manual versus partially automated driving and daytime (full sleep) versus night-time (sleep deprived). The results showed that night-time driving led to markedly increased levels of sleepiness in terms of subjective sleepiness ratings, blink durations, PERCLOS, pupil diameter and heart rate. Partially automated driving led to slightly higher subjective sleepiness ratings, longer blink durations, decreased pupil diameter, slower heart rate, and higher EEG alpha and theta activity. However, elevated levels of sleepiness mainly arose from the night-time drives when the sleep pressure was high. During daytime, when the drivers were alert, partially automated driving had little or no detrimental effects on driver fatigue. Whether the negative effects of increased sleepiness during partially automated driving can be compensated by the positive effects of lateral and longitudinal driving support needs to be investigated in further studies.}

abstract = {Background
Driving under the influence of drugs, including alcohol, is a globally recognised risk factor for road traffic crashes. While the prevalence of alcohol and other drugs in fatal road crashes has been examined in other countries, recent data investigating drug driving in fatal Australian crashes are limited. This study aimed to examine how the presence of alcohol and other drugs in fatal road trauma in Victoria has changed over time in different road users.
Methods
A population-based review of road trauma deaths was performed over the period of 01 July 2006 to 30 June 2016 in Victoria, Australia, using data from the National Coronial Information System (NCIS) and the Victorian State Trauma Registry (VSTR). Drugs were grouped according to type and analysed accordingly. Poisson regression models were used to determine change in incidence rates over the study period.
Results
There were 2287 road traffic fatalities with complete toxicology data (97% of all road traffic fatalities). Alcohol (blood alcohol concentration, BAC) was the most commonly detected drug (>0.001 g/100 mL: 21.1%; >0.05 g/100 mL: 18.4%), followed by opioids (17.3%), THC (13.1%), antidepressants (9.7%), benzodiazepines (8.8%), amphetamine-type stimulants (7.1%), ketamine (3.4%), antipsychotics (0.9%) and cocaine (0.2%). Trends demonstrated changing use over time with specific drugs. Alcohol positive road fatalities declined 9% per year in passenger car/4WD drivers (IRR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.88−0.95). The incidence of strong opioids (oxycodone, fentanyl, morphine, and methadone) increased 6% per year (IRR = 1.06; 95% CI: 1.02–1.10). Methylamphetamine was detected in 6.6% of cases and showed a yearly increase of 7% (IRR = 1.07; 95% CI: 1.01–1.13). The incidence of THC remained unchanged over the period, observed in 13.1% of cases. Stronger opioids were more commonly detected among pedal cyclists (19.0%) and pedestrians (20.9%) while THC was more commonly detected among motorcyclists (19.8%) and other light vehicle drivers (17.6%).
Conclusions
A decline in the prevalence of alcohol in fatalities suggests that law enforcement and public health strategies in Australia to address road fatalities and drink-driving may have had a positive effect. However, increases were observed in the incidence of other potentially impairing drugs including opioids and amphetamines, specifically methylamphetamine, indicating a concerning trend in road safety in Victoria that warrants further monitoring.}

abstract = {Safety assessment of road sections and networks have historically relied on police-reported crash data. These data have several noteworthy and significant shortcomings, including under-reporting, subjectivism, post hoc assessment of crash causes and contributing factors, limited behavioural information, and omitted potential important crash-related factors resulting in an omitted variable bias. Moreover, crashes are relatively rare events and require long observation periods to justify expenditures. The rarity of crashes leads to a moral dilemma—we must wait for sufficient crashes to accrue at a site—some involving injuries and even death—to then justify improvements to prevent crashes. The more quickly the profession can end its reliance on crashes to assess road safety, the better. Surrogate safety assessment methodologies, in contrast, are proactive in design, do not rely on crashes, and require shorter observation timeframes in which to formulate reliable safety assessments. Although surrogate safety assessment methodologies have been developed and assessed over the past 50 years, an overarching and unifying framework does not exist to date. A unifying framework will help to contextualize the role of various methodological developments and begin a productive discussion in the literature about how the various pieces do or should fit together to understand road user risk better. This paper aims to fill this gap by thoroughly mapping traffic conflicts and surrogate safety methodologies. A total of 549 studies were meticulously reviewed to achieve this aim of developing a unifying framework. The resulting framework provides a consolidated and up-to-date summary of surrogate safety assessment methodologies and conflict measures and metrics. Further work is needed to advance surrogate safety methodologies. Critical research needs to include identifying a comprehensive and reliable set of surrogate measures for risk assessment, establishing rigorous relationships between conflicts and crashes, developing ways to capture road user behaviours into surrogate-based safety assessment, and integrating crash severity measures into risk estimation.}

Based on the Structural Equation Model (SEM), this study involves a sample of 3150 drivers from the Strategic Highway Research Program 2 (SHRP 2), to explore the relationships among drivers’ demographic characteristics (gender, age, and cumulative driving years), sensation seeking, risk perception, and risky driving behaviors. More specifically, the mediation model of driver characteristics on risky driving behaviors moderated by gender is constructed by the SEM. The results show that the effects of driving experience on risky driving behaviors are partially mediated by sensation seeking and risk perception for male drivers, while those are completely mediated by sensation seeking and risk perception for female drivers. Moreover, the development trend of risky driving behavior engagements declines greater with the growing of driving experience for female drivers than male drivers. Finally, a classification model of the driver’s driving risk is proposed by the Random Forest classifier, in which the driving risk level of the driver evaluated by the crash and near-crash rate could be classified through the driver’s self-reported demographics, sensation seeking, risk perception, and risky driving behaviors. The classification accuracy achieves up to 90 percent, which offers an alternative approach to identifying potential high-risk drivers to reduce property losses, injuries, and death caused by traffic accidents.}

The present research used the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) to explore the psychological reasons underpinning intentions to use a mobile phone while driving in general, as well as to send and read text messages while driving across four different scenarios. Convenience sampling was used to obtain data from 314 participants who held a valid licence to drive in the UK, had driven at least once in the last six months and owned a mobile phone. General intentions to use a mobile phone while driving were predicted by positive Attitudes towards the behaviour and higher Perceived Behavioural Control. Moreover, when predicting intentions to send and read text messages, it was positive Attitudes that was the most consistent and significant predictor. Surprisingly, neither Perceived Behavioural Control nor Subjective Norms were significant predictors of intentions to send or read text messages. Furthermore, perceptions of risk (crashing and being apprehended by the police) were significant predictors of intentions to send and read texts over and above that provided by the TPB variables. The present research highlights the need for interventions to target attitudinal change and to increase risk perceptions in order to reduce the prevalence of these risky behaviours.}

Although traffic accidents cause considerable economic losses and injuries to individuals, families, and communities, little is known about the impact of meteorological factors on the incidence of traffic accident injuries (TAIs). Therefore, a time-series study was conducted to explore the effect of meteorological variables on TAIs in Dalian, Northern China.
Methods
Poisson generalized linear models (PGLM) combined with distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNM) were used to estimate the association between daily TAIs and ambient temperature in Dalian, China, 2015–2017. The injury data collected by Dalian national injury surveillance hospitals, and meteorological data were extracted and accumulated from the National Meteorological Information Center. Modified the model with variables such as pressure, humidity, precipitation, PM2.5, SO2, O3, day of the week, seasonality, and time trend. In the subgroup analysis, the modification effects of gender and age were also examined.
Results
Both high temperatures (RR = 1.198, 95％CI：1.017–1.411) and low temperatures (RR = 1.017, 95％CI：1.001–1.035) increased the risk of TAIs. The cumulative lag effect would last until after the 7th day. While the 40−59 years subgroup seemed to be more vulnerable in high temperature environments, those who are more than 60 years showed higher TAIs in low temperatures for both single-day and cumulative TAI risks.
Conclusions
Identifying the association between ambient temperature and traffic injuries could provide needed scientific evidence for relevant public health actions.}

To study this, single-vehicle crashes occurring in rainy weather, where speed too fast for conditions is a driver action identified as a contributing factor to the crash, were considered. The differences between the resulting crash-injury severities of male and female drivers (and how these differences change over time) is then studied utilizing three years of Florida crash data and estimating random parameters multinomial logit models of driver injury severity while considering potential heterogeneity in the means and variances of parameter estimates. Model estimation results show that there were significant differences in the driver-injury severities of male and female drivers, and that the effect of factors that determine injury severities varied significantly over time (statistically significant temporal instability). This suggests that male and female drivers generally perceive and react to rainy weather conditions in fundamentally different ways, and that their responses, as reflected by the effect that explanatory variables have on injury severity probabilities, change over time. However, there were two explanatory variables that had relatively stable effects on injury-severity probabilities over time and across genders: an indicator variable for crashes involving non-collision factors (including overturn/rollover crashes) and an indicator variable for restraint usage. Policies that target these two variables could produce long-term reductions in crash-injury severities under adverse conditions.}

abstract = {Reliability analysis has been advocated as a robust methodology to quantify the risk (known as the probability of non-compliance, Pnc) associated with design limitations such as insufficient sight distance on horizontal curves. This risk represents the probability that the current design (e.g., available sight distance) would fail to meet the requirements of the driving population (e.g., required sight distance). Although previous work has quantified the risk and established links between Pnc and safety, Pnc remains a statistical measure that is not informative enough to roadway designers. To overcome this limitation, the impacts of geometric design attributes on the Pnc as well as the direct and indirect (through the impacts on Pnc) impacts of those attributes on safety need to be modelled and understood. To achieve the aforementioned objective, this paper proposes the adoption of Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) to simultaneously model the relationships mentioned above using data collected on horizontal curves in Alberta, Canada. Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data was first used to extract curve information and assess the 3D available sight distance on 244 curved highway segments. Reliability analysis was then used to quantify the Pnc associated with each curved segment. SEM was then used to test the impacts of curve geometric and traffic attributes on Pnc as well as the direct and indirect impacts those variables have on collision frequency. The results showed that Pnc, curve length, and traffic volume all had statistically significant effects on collision frequency. Curve attributes such as the curve’s deflection angle and chord length had statistically significant impacts on Pnc. Both curve deflection angle and the chord length were also found to have an indirect influence on collisions, which was mediated through Pnc. The findings emphasize the importance of considering other curve attributes when designing horizontal curves instead of focusing entirely on the curve radius. The findings of this research provide insights into the indirect impacts of curve attributes of horizontal curves on safety. This could help designers consider curve features that have the highest impacts on non-compliance and safety levels.}

This study focused on the validity of two commonly used SMoS indicators—minimum time to collision and post-encroachment time—with a specific focus on bicyclist–motor vehicle interactions. The study was divided into two main parts; the first part focused on observations at intersections in Scandinavia, and the second part focused on developing a crash model using data from 166 similar intersections. Nine signalised intersections in Scandinavia were observed for at least 24 h. During this time, each interaction between a bicyclist and a right- or left-turning motor vehicle was identified and trajectories for the road users were created. The corresponding SMoS values were then calculated. Three main results were found when comparing the results of the crash model with the SMoS analysis. First, there is a significant relationship between the expected number of crashes and both indicators. However, the results also suggest that this correlation might originate from the inherent connection between the indicators and the number of interactions between the studied road users. Finally, when the number of interactions is considered, the results show that the minimum time to collision with a threshold of 3–4 s produces the best results.}

With GIS-supported mapping of traffic accidents, we identified the most dangerous curves on the main rural road in Croatia and replicated them on the driving simulator. Based on the driving runs of 43 participants, the study concluded that both measures, used either alone or combined with a vertical warning sign, significantly reduced the speed compared to the control condition (vertical warning sign alone). Additionally, the use of a red median prompted the lateral movement of the vehicle closer to the edge line. The paper also defines the potential use of the measures for dealing with specific types of curve-related accidents.}

While experiments have indicated that driver distractions are associated with slower driving speeds, the methodologies tend to have limited external validity. Observational studies are often conducted under limited circumstances – be it time or location. Therefore, in order to better understand the nature of driver distractions, the authors investigated the relationships between driving speed, posted speed limits, and phone handling frequency through naturalistic driving data obtained (via disruptive technology) from 8,240 mobile application users on state-maintained highways throughout Texas. As a measure of manual distractions, a phone handling rate (PHR; times/hours driven) was calculated based on phone rotations. Within-subject comparisons were drawn for driving speed and posted speed limits under normal driving conditions and distracted conditions. The analysis revealed a strong negative correlation between PHR and driving speed (rs = -0.87). Paired t-tests revealed significantly lower driving speeds (p = 0.000 < 0.01, d = -0.48, η = 0.69) and posted speed limits (p = 0.000 < 0.01, d = -0.20, η = 0.42) during phone handling events when compared to driving without phone handling. On average, users drove 3.26 mph slower in distracted conditions than in undistracted conditions. Driving speed had a larger effect size than posted speed limits. The findings were in line with existing theories and experiments as well as other observational studies conducted at fixed locations. Although this research did not reveal causal relations, it is noteworthy that speed reduction with manual distractions was observed under real road conditions. Spatial analyses are recommended to conduct in order to paint a more thorough picture of speed reduction, its relationship to space, and crash risks related to distracted driving.}

To overcome the complexity of emergency medical services times impact on crash outcome, the interaction effects of EMS times and injury location on the body were also investigated in a separate model. This study utilized the linked data of police-reported crash data and emergency medical services runs, including 2192 crash injuries that transferred to hospital. A random-effects ordered probit approach was implemented to identify effective factors on crash injury severity. Three models of (1) crash-related variables, (2) crash-related and emergency medical services times and (3) crash-related, emergency medical services times and interaction effects of EMS times and injury location on the body were developed. Although the outcome could not find the impact of faster emergency medical services times on injury severity in the second model, in the third model, faster response time and slower on-scene time were associated with decreasing the severity of entire-body injuries. We discuss why this may be the case.}

Since 2014, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) has been collecting AV collision and disengagement reports, which are valuable data sources for studying AV crash patterns. A crash sequence of events describes the AV’s interactions with other road users before a collision in a temporal manner. In this study, sequence of events data extracted from California AV collision reports were used to investigate patterns and how they may be used to develop AV test scenarios. Employing sequence analysis methods and clustering, this study evaluated 168 AV crashes (with AV in automatic driving mode before disengagement or collision) reported to the California DMV from 2015 to 2019. Analysis of subsequences showed that the most representative pattern in AV crashes was “collision following AV stop”. Analysis of event transition showed that disengagement, as an event in 24% of all studied AV crash sequences, had a transition probability of 68% to an immediate collision. Cluster analysis characterized AV crash sequences into seven groups with distinctive crash dynamic features. Cross-tabulation analysis showed that sequence groups were significantly associated with variables measuring crash outcomes and describing environmental conditions. Crash sequences are useful for developing AV test scenarios. Based on the findings, a scenario-based AV safety testing framework was proposed with sequence of events embedded as a core component.}

This study proposes a Bayesian spatiotemporal interaction (BSTI) approach for crash frequency modeling with an integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) method to greatly expedite the Bayesian estimation process. Manhattan, which is the most densely populated urban area of New York City, is selected as the study area. Hexagons are used as the basic geographic units to capture crash, transportation, land use, and demo-economic data from 2013 to 2019. A series of Bayesian models with various spatiotemporal specifications are developed and compared. The BSTI model with Type II interaction, which assumes that the structured temporal random effect interacts with the unstructured spatial random effect is found to outperform the others in terms of goodness-of-fit and the ability to reduce the dependency of residuals. It is also found that the unobserved heterogeneity is mostly attributed to the spatial effects instead of temporal effects. In addition, the BSTI Type II model also yields the lowest predictive error when the last year’s data are used as the test set. The proposed BSTI approach can potentially advance safety analytics by achieving high prediction accuracy and computational efficiency while maintaining its interpretability on the effects of contributing factors and the unobserved heterogeneity.}

abstract = {As one crucial mobility problem for elderly drivers, vehicle crashes due to elderly drivers account for an increased ratio of total vehicle crashes in recent years in Japan. Mandating a driving lesson for elderly drivers was implemented and revised continuously to reduce the number of vehicle crashes. To perform a practical driving lesson for elderly drivers, it is essential to evaluate whether it can reduce vehicle crashes significantly or not. Most previous studies only investigated its effects on fatal or severe rates using rather simple methods, without consideration for the increasing number of elderly drivers and the variability of vehicle crashes in different months. To bridge these research gaps, this study examines the impact of mandating a driving lesson for elderly drivers by some advanced statistical methods based on a monthly level. Vehicle crash records from April 2005 to December 2019 collected in Toyota City, Japan are used for empirical analysis. Three types of count data models, i.e., the Poisson regression model, the Negative Binomial regression model, and the Poisson Integer-Valued Autoregressive (INAR) (1) model are proposed in this study. A comparison of three proposed models was implemented to indicate the similarity and distinction of estimation results. The significant findings of this study suggest that: 1) three proposed models have the same prediction accuracy referring to indexes of Root Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and Mean Squared Error; 2) all of them indicate that the revision of license renewal legislation for elderly drivers in March 2017 is a significant factor negatively affecting the number of vehicle crashes at a 10 % significance level; 3) all of them indicate that the number of drivers aged 65 years or older and month-variability are significant factors affecting the number of vehicle crashes at least a 10 % significance level; 4) the time-series nature of vehicle crashes due to elderly drivers was not existing indicated by the result of the Poisson INAR (1) model. Statistical methods proposed in this study can be referred by researchers and engineers to evaluate the effects of traffic safety measures in the research field of traffic and transportation engineering.}

abstract = {Bicyclists are vulnerable road users who risk incurring severe injuries from traffic incidents involving motorists. However, the prevalence of severe bicycle injuries varies across countries and is not well-documented in Latin American countries. Studies from developed countries outside of Latin America have shown that individual and contextual factors are associated with severe injuries incurred by bicyclists in road traffic incidents with motorists, but it is not clear whether these factors are the same as those incurred by Latin American bicyclists. Moreover, most studies on bicyclist-motorist traffic incidents have treated injury severity as a binary variable for analysis although injuries range widely in severity. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of bicycle injuries from incidents between motorists and bicyclists in Chile and examine the associations between individual and contextual factors and bicyclist injury severity, treated as an ordinal outcome variable, in these incidents. Data on road traffic incidents between bicyclists and motorists from the 2016 Traffic Accident of Bicycle Riders and Consequences database of the Chilean Transport Ministry were analysed. Multilevel mixed-effects ordinal regression models were used to examine associations. In total, 81.2 % of 4093 traffic incidents between bicyclists and motorists resulted in nonfatal injuries to bicyclists and another 2.3 % resulted in fatalities. Most incidents involved collisions (84.3 %), and most were due to a motorist being distracted while driving (50.4 %). Severe bicyclist injuries were more likely when the incident involved a stationary cyclist who was struck, a collision between a moving bicycle and a moving motor vehicle, or an overturning motor vehicle striking a bicyclist (p < 0.001). Other factors included the motorist driving under the influence of alcohol (p = 0.05), the incident taking place in a mid-size community (p = 0.04), the incident occurring between 7:00 pm and 4:59 am (p < 0.01), and the injured bicyclist being under 18 years or 45+ years of age (p < 0.05). These findings suggest the need for educational programs that promote safe driving behaviour in the presence of bicyclists, better enforcement of laws and higher penalties for distracted or drunk driving, and provision of high-quality exclusive bicyclist infrastructure to address the vulnerability of the youngest and oldest bicyclists on shared roads, particularly in mid-size communities, and to provide better lighting on bikeways for evening bicycling, to reduce the high incidence of severe bicyclist injuries in motorist-bicyclist incidents.}

As driver error is a primary factor affecting bus crashes, driver safety education is one of the main countermeasures used to mitigate crash risk. In China, however, safety education is not as focused as it should be, largely due to the limited research identifying the specific driver behaviors, and potential influences on those behaviors, that are correlated with crashes. The aim of this study is, therefore, to explore the fleet- and driver-level risk factors underlying bus drivers’ self-reported crash involvement, including analyzing the effect of psychological distress on the most influential driver-level factors. A survey was conducted of 725 drivers from a large Shanghai bus company, and a random-effects two-level logit model was developed to integrate fleet and individual variables. Results showed that: 1) the fleet-level safety climate explained about 8.5% of the model’s variance, indicating it was a valid predictor of self-reported crash involvement; 2) the driver-level factors of drivers’ age, seniority, marital status, positive behavior, and driving anger influenced drivers’ self-reported crash involvement, but ordinary violations, lapses, aggressive violations, and insomnia were the most influential variables; 3) psychological distress appeared to associate with the high frequency of risky driving behavior and the high severity of driving anger. This study’s findings will help bus companies to give more attention to their safety climate and implement more targeted improvements to their driver safety education programs.}

abstract = {The frequent crash occurrences have caused massive loss of lives and properties all over the world. In order to improve traffic safety, it is vital to understand the relationships between traffic operation conditions and crash risk, and further implement safety countermeasures. Emerging studies have conducted the crash risk analyses using discrete and aggregated traffic data (e.g., loop detector data, probe vehicle data), where crash events were selected as the prediction target. However, traditional traffic sensing data obtained at segment level cannot describe the detailed operation conditions for the vehicle platoons near crash locations. Thus, more microscopic and high-resolution traffic sensing data are needed. In addition, considering the random occurrence feature of crashes, high-risk events should be paid more attentions given their higher occurrence probability and consistent causations with crashes, which could proactively reduce crash likelihood. In this study, HighD Dataset from German highways was utilized for the empirical analyses. First, high-risk events were obtained using safety surrogate measures with Modified Time to Collision (MTTC) less than 2 s. Traffic operation characteristics within 5 s prior to event occurrence were extracted based on vehicle trajectory data. Then, a total of three different logistic regression models were established, which are standard logistic regression model, random-effects logistic regression (RELR) model, and random-parameter logistic regression (RPLR) model. Among which, the RPLR model was showed to have the best fitness and prediction accuracy. The results showed that the disturbed traffic flows in both longitudinal and lateral directions have positive impacts on high-risk events occurrence. Besides, too close following distance between vehicles would lead to high-risk events. Moreover, RPLR models could provide a high prediction accuracy of 97 % for 2 s ahead of the high-risk events. Finally, potential safety improvement countermeasures and future application scenarios were also discussed.}

Several studies have investigated this database to compare automated vehicle crash rates with national rates. Although automated vehicles are struck from behind in 73 % of their autonomous mode crashes, this is the first study to compare automated vehicle struck-from-behind crash rates to national rates using equivalent crash definitions. Rear-end collisions have substantial public health and economic impacts, representing a third of all collisions and $3.9 B in annual economic costs. In this study, automated vehicles in autonomous mode were found to be struck from behind at 4.8 times the rate of human-driven vehicles in a naturalistic driving study. When controlling for driving environment, the rates for AVs were 5.0 times higher for urban driving and not significant for business/industrial driving, although these results are for different manufacturers, complicating the results. Automated vehicles were more likely to be struck when stopped than when moving compared to human-driven vehicles, suggesting that automated vehicles’ decisions about where and when to stop or remain stopped at intersections are more plausible contributing factors than unexpected rates of deceleration.}

In order to increase the use of such disaggregated spatial methods for use in traffic safety studies, the current study documents the application of a new RGB (red, green, blue) model which combines the color additive theorem and the kernel density map (KDE) to define crash colocation patterns and the coincidence spaces of related variables. This study contributes to the literature in three major ways: (1) a new RGB model was established and applied in the field of traffic safety; (2) the variable dimensions were expanded from two to three; and, (3) the dimension of uncertainty was also included. When the new RGB model was utilized with data collected in College Station, Texas, the results indicated that the new colocation map is able to clearly and accurately define colocation hotspots of crashes, crimes, and alcohol retailers. As expected, these hotspots are located in areas with many bars, the largest strip malls and busiest intersections. The intensity maps have provided results consistent with the above colocation maps. However, the uncertainty map does not show a relatively higher level of certainty regarding the location of hotspots as we expected because the input of each variable was not related to the highest kernel value. Therefore, future scholars should focus on the colocation and intensity maps while using the uncertainty map as a reference for individual event risk evaluation only.}

Thus, a transition of control, colloquially known as take-over of the vehicle, is required when the system sends a take-over request (TOR) upon exiting the operational design domain (ODD). An adaptive TOR along with good take-over performance requires adjusting the time budget (TB) to drivers’ visual distraction state, adhering to a reliable visual-distraction-based take-over performance model. Based on a number of driving simulator experiments, the percentage of face orientation to distraction area (PFODA) and time to boundary at take-over timing (TTBT) were proposed to accurately evaluate the degree of visual distraction based on merely face orientation under naturalistic non-driving related tasks (NDRTs) and to evaluate take-over performance, respectively. In order to elucidate the safety boundary, this study also proposed an algorithm to set a suitable minimum value of the TTBT. Finally, a multiple regression model was built to describe the relationship among PFODA, TB and TTBT along with a corrected coefficient of determination of 0.748. Based on the model, this study proposed an adaptive TB adjustment method for the take-over system.}

This study identifies the factors delineating a primary crash that results in secondary crashes within a minute from a regular crash that does not result in any secondary crashes. Random-effects, random-parameter and two-level binary logistic regression models are applied to data collected on 8779 crashes on the freeway network of the Guizhou Province, China in 2018, of which 299 are consecutive crashes. According to the AIC values, the two-level logistic model outperforms the other two models. Rear-end primary crashes have a significant random effect varying across road segments on the occurrence of consecutive crashes. Various crash types (rear-end, roll-over and side-swipe), tunnel crash and foggy weather are positively associated with the possibility to cause subsequent consecutive crashes, whereas single-vehicle crash, truck involvement and the time periods with poorer natural lighting are less likely to incur consecutive crashes. Recommendations are provided to minimize the possibility of the occurrence of consecutive crashes on a freeway.}

The aims of this study were to examine the utility of self-determination theory in explaining risky driving behaviours and to explore differences between young Learner and Provisional (P1)- licensed drivers in regard to their self-regulated safety orientation and engagement in risky driving behaviours. Learners (n = 1038) and P1(n = 589) drivers, aged 16–19 years, responded to a 91-item online survey, including self-regulated safety orientation items adapted from self-determination theory and inattentive and intentional risky driving behaviour items. Results showed that self-determination theory had good predictive power for the two types of risky driving behaviours for both licence groups. Learner and P1 drivers’ engagement in risky behaviours was similar, however, the relative importance of self-regulated safety orientation elements to reduced engagement in these behaviours differed. Learners’ engagement in intentional risky behaviours reflected greater perceived effort/importance and pressure/tension compared to P1 drivers. Greater effort/importance is an overarching indicator of internalised regulation concerning safe driving behaviours, which might be primed when first exposed to driving. However, greater perceived pressure/tension suggests that internalisation of self-regulatory processes is being suppressed during the Learner phase. This might stem from the required presence of driver trainers and supervisory drivers, as well as interactions with other road users. Whilst only tentative explanations in this first exploration, the findings suggest there is potential for greater efforts in Learner driver training and supervision to encompass the types of skills and learning that encourage the development of self-regulation to reduce risky driving behaviours during both the Learner and P1 stage. These findings contribute to the limited research regarding self-regulation by young novice drivers and informs a better understanding of the psychological influences of engagement in risky driving behaviours, including the first such examination among early independent licensed drivers.}

abstract = {In Australia, cycling hospitalisations are increasing and the cycling participation rate is stagnating. In an effort to improve cyclist safety, many Australian jurisdictions have mandated a minimum passing distance that vehicles much provide when overtaking a cyclist on a public road, including the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). However, it is not currently clear how vehicle-cyclist passing distances are affected by various parameters such as the road environment, the vehicles involved, or the speed limit. This naturalistic bicycle riding study examined data from passing distance measurement devices that were installed on the bicycles of volunteer cyclists who ride in the ACT, to explore how passing distances and compliance with the minimum passing distance were affected by several parameters. Over a four-week period, 23 volunteer cyclist participants undertook 465 journeys and travelled 6531 km over a total period of 271 h. There were 10,959 passing events identified on roads zoned greater than 60 km/h (high speed roads) of which 1349 (12.3 %) were non-compliant. On roads zoned 60 km/h or less (low speed roads) there were 5517 passing events of which 153 (2.8 %) were non-compliant. Regression analyses showed that differences in passing distance and non-compliance with the minimum passing distance were associated with road classification, bike lane presence, and speed limit. The results were mixed but, in general, passing distances were greater on roads with a lower (hierarchy) classification and on motorways as well as on roads with higher speed limits. An exception to this was roads with a speed limit of 50 km/h where passing distances were closer in comparison to roads with a speed limit of 60 km/h. Bike lanes were generally associated with an increase in passing distance except on ‘trunk’ classified roads, where a bike lane resulted in closer passing events. This suggests that on trunk roads, which are assumed to carry large amounts of traffic, bike lanes may be insufficient to offer protection to cyclists and additional measures may be required.}

Data exploited herein are collected from a sophisticated platform that uses smartphone device sensors during a naturalistic driving experiment, at which the driving behavior from a sample of two hundred (200) drivers during 7-months is continuously recorded in real time. The main driving behavior analytics taken into consideration for the driving assessment include distance travelled, acceleration, braking, speed and smartphone usage. The analysis is performed using statistical, optimization and machine learning techniques. The driver’s safety efficiency index is estimated both in total and in several consecutive time windows to allow for the investigation of safety efficiency evolution in time. Initial data analysis results to the most critical components of microscopic driving behaviour evolution, which are used as inputs in the k-means algorithm to perform the clustering analysis. The main driving characteristics of each cluster are identified and lead to the conclusion that there are three main driving groups of the a) moderate drivers, b) unstable drivers and c) cautious drivers.}

Moreover, the effects of the joint and separate use of the speed/red-light camera (SRLC) and the traffic signal countdown timer (TSCT) on dilemma zone determination and safety were investigated. Multiple linear regression was conducted to define the minimum stopping and maximum passing distance boundaries, and binary logistic regression was conducted to define the boundary of dilemma zone type II based on the probability of stopping. The results show that SRLC significantly shifts the dilemma zone downstream and increases the probability of stopping by 11 %. TSCT was found not to have any significant effect on the dilemma zone, but it was found to increase the approaching speeds.

Five features of HAVs’ capabilities are formed based on previous studies and evaluated qualitatively using data from fatal crashes between driver-managed passenger cars and cyclist in Finland. By analysing these crashes, it is assessed which features HAVs should have in order to avoid each crash in a hypothetical setting, in which driver-managed cars would be replaced by HAVs. The necessary features of HAVs for crash avoidance are analysed crash-by-crash by considering the obligation to yield, visual obstacles at the crash scene and driver’s behaviour prior to the crash. In order to avoid different types of fatal crashes with cyclists, the HAVs should be able to recognize nearby cyclists (feature 1), be aware of the priority rules in various intersections and traffic situations (2), indicate its intentions to cyclists (3), maintain safe driving patterns and anticipate future situations (4), and assess cyclists’ intentions (5). Albeit the number of different features to allow crash avoidance is only five, implementing these features is a considerable challenge for HAVs’ programming and design, as these should function in various and complex traffic situations. The study discloses the complexity in the encounters between HAVs and cyclists, which are to be considered in further studies and real-world implementations.}

Determining such a method in general requires trial-and-error experimentation, which consumes large amounts of time and money. We used the uniform experiment (UE) and generalized linear autoregression (GLAR) to establish our method. Based on it, a series of numerical models were proposed to examine the association between the operational indices of safety (derailment coefficient and rate of wheel unloading) and such factors as the type of wagon, cargo weight, partial loading (covering longitudinal and lateral offset), line condition, and operating speed. The models were used to determine the worst transportation conditions. The results of analysis showed the following: 1) the effect of the speed of operation on the safety indices followed a parabolic law, those of cargo weight and part loading followed a linear law, the type of wagon and line condition exhibited no clear regularity, and some of these factors have an interactive influence. 2) A combination of the UE and GLAR helped deal with the complex multivariate process using the fewest multilevel experiments to accurately determine the most adverse conditions for railway freight transportation. The proposed method provided reference schemes for governmental agencies to study and revise freight management regulations.}

However, few studies have examined how driving break between driver education and owning a car influences novice drivers’ traffic violations. The main objective of this study is to examine the association between driving break and traffic violations. Data from 356,786 drivers with a total of 978,855 violations during their first year of driving were extracted from the Wuhan Traffic Management Bureau. Specifically, we focused on three outcome measures: time length of first traffic violation, severity of first traffic violation, and number of traffic violations in the first year of driving. The results indicated that driving break accelerated the occurrence of the first traffic violation but reduced its severity. The results also showed that driving break was significantly related to an increase in traffic violations during the first year of driving. The detrimental effects of driving break on the time length of first traffic violation and the number of traffic violations in the first year of driving were attenuated in older age groups. The inhibitory effect of driving break on serious violations was stronger in older age groups. The findings support that the effectiveness of driver education will fade over time if one does not consolidate the learned knowledge and skills through practice.}

In addition, the mediating or moderating effects of roadway attributes on the CVP-vs-safety relationships, have not been investigated. In addressing this gap in the literature, this study integrates databases on crashes, traffic, and inventory for Hong Kong road segments spanning 2014–2017. The classes of commercial vehicles considered are public buses, taxi, and light-, medium- and heavy-goods vehicles. Random-parameter Tobit models were estimated using the crash rates. The results suggest that the CVP of each class show credible effects on the crash rates, for the various crash severity levels. The results also suggest that the interaction between CVP and roadway attributes is credible enough to mediate the effect of CVP on crash rates, and the magnitude and direction of such mediation varies across the vehicle classes, crash severity levels, and roadway attribute type in four ways. First, the increasing effect of taxi proportion on slight-injury crash rate is magnified at road segments with high intersection density. Second, the increasing effect of light-goods vehicle proportion on slight-injury crash rate is magnified at road segments with on-street parking. Third, the association between the medium- and heavy-goods vehicle proportion and killed/severe injury (KSI) crash rate, is moderated by the roadway width (number of traffic lanes). Finally, a higher proportion of medium- and heavy-goods vehicles generally contributes to increased KSI crash rate at road segments with high intersection density. Overall, the findings of this research are expected not only to help guide commercial vehicle enforcement strategy, licensing policy, and lane control measures, but also to review existing urban roadway designs to enhance safety.}

abstract = {Motorcycles and motorcyclists have a variety of attributes that have been found to be a potential contributor to the high liability of vulnerable road users (VRUs). Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) that include pedestrians, bicyclists, cycle-rickshaw occupants, and motorcyclists constitute by far the highest share of road traffic accidents in developing countries. Motorized three-wheeled Rickshaws (3W-MR) is a popular public transport mode in almost all Pakistani cities and is used primarily for short trips to carry passengers and small-scale goods movement. Despite being an important mode of public transport in the developing world, little work has been done to understand the factors affecting the injury severity of three-wheeled motorized vehicles. Crash injury severity prediction is a promising research target in traffic safety. Traditional statistical models have underlying assumptions and predefined associations, which can yield misleading results if flouted. Machine learning(ML) is an emerging non-parametric method that can effectively capture the non-linear effects of both continuous and discrete variables without prior assumptions and achieve better prediction accuracy. This research analyzed injury severity of three-wheeled motorized rickshaws (3W-MR) using various machine learning-based identification algorithms, i.e., Decision jungle (DJ), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT). Three years of crash data (from 2017 to 2019) was collected from Provincial Emergency Response Service RESCUE 1122 for Rawalpindi city, Pakistan. A total of 2,743 3W-MR crashes were reported during the study period that resulted in 258 fatalities. The predictive performance of proposed ML models was assessed using several evaluation metrics such as overall accuracy, macro-average precision, macro-average recall, and geometric means of individual class accuracies. Results revealed that DJ with an overall accuracy of 83.7 % outperformed the DT and RF-based on a stratified 10-fold cross-validation approach. Finally, Spearman correlation analysis showed that factors such as the lighting condition, crashes involving young drivers (aged 20–30 years), facilities with high-speed limits (over 60 mph), weekday, off-peak, and shiny weather conditions were more likely to worsen injury severity of 3W-MR crashes. The outcomes of this study could provide necessary and essential guidance to road safety agencies, particularly in the study area, for proactive implementation of appropriate countermeasures to curb road safety issues pertaining to three-wheeled motorized vehicles.}

A total of 31 young participants were recruited, and each completed 5 driving simulator trials under varying visibility conditions and speed levels during the daytime. The combined coupling effect of the visibility and driving speed on drivers’ recognition times was explored, and a quantitative model of the recognition time, visibility, and driving speed was established. A determination method and suggested value of a reasonable driving speed limit in dynamic low-visibility conditions were proposed based on the stopping sight distance model. The results show that there are significant differences in the recognition times of drivers under different visibility and speed conditions. The reasonable driving speed limit values in dynamic low-visibility conditions should be based on visibility changes. When the stopping sight distance is 75 m and the visibility is less than 35 m, the speed limit should be 20 km/h. When the visibility is between 35 m and 60 m, the speed limit should be 30 km/h. When the visibility is between 60 m and 140 m, the speed limit should be 50 km/h. When the visibility is greater than 140 m, the speed limit should be 60 km/h. These research results can provide a theoretical reference for the formulation of a VSL in a dynamic low-visibility environment related to fog and reduce crash risk in conditions of inadequate visibility in fog.}

abstract = {Background
Traditionally, a first step toward independence for a North American youth has been to obtain a driver’s licence. Licensure can be associated with freedom and independence to provide teens opportunities to participate in conventional and health-enhancing behaviours, such as school, work, sporting events and other social activities, and/or provide opportunities to engage in unconventional, risk taking and health compromising behaviours. Yet, recent trends show that youth are delaying getting their licence.
Objective
The purpose of this study was to use the constructs of conventional and unconventional behaviours identified in Problem Behaviour Theory (PBT) under the behaviour system to examine whether driver licensure status in youth was associated with conventional, health-enhancing behaviours or unconventional, health compromising, risky behaviours.
Method
Data were derived from the 2015 and 2017 cycles of the Ontario Student Drug Use Survey (OSDUHS). Analyses are based on a subsample of students who were at least 16 years of age. Included measures: driver’s licence (at least a G1 – the first stage of a 3-stage graduated licensing system), conventional behaviours (academic performance, school connectedness, employment, physical activity, and sleep), unconventional behaviours (tobacco use, cannabis use, alcohol use, binge drinking, hazardous drinking, problematic drug use, screen time, and number of antisocial behaviours), and control factors (age, sex, region, family Socio-Economic Status (SES)).
Results
67.97 % of youth 16–19 years of age obtained a driver’s licence. Of the sample, 71.80 % of males, 75.05 % not living in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), and 70.86 % of youth with an average family SES received their driver’s licence. In regression analyses, older youth, males, and youth not living in the GTA had significantly higher odds of obtaining a driver’s licence than younger youth, females, and youth living in the GTA. Conventional behaviours that were significantly positively associated with licensure status included youth who had high academic achievement, good social connectedness, and who were employed. Unconventional behaviours that were significantly positively associated with licensure status included alcohol use and binge drinking.
Discussion
In agreement with Problem Behaviour Theory, the results show that youth who obtain their licence show limited problematic lifestyle or ‘proneness’ (Gohari, 2019). Alcohol use and binge drinking were significantly associated with youth obtaining a driver’s licence but hazardous drinking was not. This study suggests that a driver’s licence for youth could both control but also instigate unconventional behaviours as identified by PBT. A driver’s licence could also provide opportunities for conventional behaviours associated with education and school connectedness. However, the independence provided by a driver’s licence could offer youth unsupervised social opportunities to drink and binge drink that may be health-compromising. Thus, based on PBT, licensure status is associated with both conventional behaviours, as well as problem behaviours associated with alcohol use.}

We used a case-crossover design, randomly selecting control sites from modelled cyclist routes, comparing these with sites where cyclists were injured. We then used conditional logistic regression for matched case–control groups modelling to compare characteristics of control and injury sites. Intersections were strongly associated with injury risk. High streets were associated with an elevated injury risk in final adjusted models, as was road type being primary, and a more downhill gradient. Lower speed limits and lower motor traffic connectivity were initially associated with lower injury risk, but these effects were no longer statistically significant in adjusted models. Increased road width was associated with increased injury risk in all models. Increased injury risk was associated in all models with presence of bus lane (somewhat mitigated at stops), guardrail, and fuel station or parking lot. Presence of parked cars in street view data raised injury risk in fully adjusted models, as did congestion (measured by low morning peak speeds), while higher volumes of people cycling along the street reduced it. In fully adjusted models, a statistically significant increase in risk was associated with presence of an on-road painted cycle lane. Most cycle lanes or tracks at control and injury sites were very poor, with narrow lanes, shared footways, and lack of protection at junctions. Given findings from other studies showing protective effects of cycle infrastructure, Britain must create higher quality cycle provision, avoiding narrow on-road painted lanes.}

abstract = {Objective
The paper presents a systematic analysis of drivers’ crash avoidance response during crashes and near-crashes and developed a machine learning-based predictive model that can determine driver maneuver using pre-incident driver behavior and driving context.
Methods
We analyzed 286 naturalistic rear-end crashes and near-crashes from the SHRP2 naturalistic driving study. All the events were manually reduced using face video (face and forward) and kinematic responses. In this paper, we developed new reduction variables that enhanced the understanding of drivers’ gaze behavior and roadway attention behavior during these events. These features reflected how the event criticality, measured using time to collision, related to drivers’ pre-incident behavior (secondary behavior, gaze behavior), and drivers’ perception of the event (physical reaction and maneuver). The imperative understanding of such relations was validated using a random forest- (RF) based classifier, which efficiently predicted if a driver was going to brake or change the lane as an avoidance maneuver.
Results
The RF presented in this paper effectively explored the nonlinear patterns in the data and was highly accurate (∼96 %) in its prediction. A further analysis of the RF model showed that six features played a pivotal role in the decision logic. These included the drivers’ last glance duration before the event, last glance eccentricity, duration of ‘eyes on road’ immediately before the event, the time instance and criticality when the driver perceives the threat as well as acknowledge the threat, and possibility of an escape path in the adjacent lane. Using partial dependency plots, we also showed how different thresholds of these feature variables determined the drivers’ maneuver intention.
Conclusions
In this paper we analyzed driving context, drivers’ behavior, event criticality, and drivers’ response in a unified structure to predict their avoidance response. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such effort where large-scale naturalistic data (crashes and near crashes) was analyzed for prediction of drivers’ maneuver and determined key behavioral and contextual factors that contribute to this avoidance maneuver.}

By taking advantages of ‘Big Data’, this study proposes a data-driven method to develop a Copula-Bayesian Network (Copula-BN) using a large-scale naturalistic driving dataset with multiple features. The Copula-BN is able to explain the causality of a risky driving maneuver. As compared with conventional BNs, the Copula-BN developed in this study has the following advantages: the Copula-BN 1. Has a more rational and explainable structure; 2. Is less likely to be over-fitting and can attain more satisfactory prediction performance; and 3. Can handle not only discrete but also continuous features. In terms of technical innovations, Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) is used for feature selection, while Gaussian Copula function is employed to build the dependency structure of the Copula-BN. As for applications, the Copula-BNs are used to investigate the causality of risky lane-changing (LC) and car-following (CF) maneuvers, upon which the comparisons are made between the two essential but risky driving maneuvers. In this study, the Copula-BNs are developed based on the Second Highway Research Program (SHRP2) Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) database. Upon network evaluation, the Copula-BNs for both risky LC and CF maneuvers demonstrate satisfactory structure performance and promising prediction performance. Feature inferences are conducted based on the Copula-BNs to respectively illustrate the causation of the two risky maneuvers. Several interesting findings related to features’ contribution are discussed in this paper. To a certain extent, the Copula-BN developed using the data-driven method makes a trade-off between prediction and causality within the ‘Big Data’. The comparison between risky LC and CF maneuvers also provides a valuable reference for crash risk evaluation, road safety policy-making, etc. In the future, the achievements of this study could be applied in Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS) and accident diagnosis system to enhance road traffic safety.}

While researchers have realized the importance of perceived safety, a direct and psychometrically sound measure is still needed. This paper aimed to develop and validate a scale to measure the perceived safety of ICVs. In Study 1, an 8-item scale of the perceived safety was developed based on a literature review and used with a sample from Beijing (n = 373), among the people who are very likely to be the first wave of users. Exploratory factor analysis retained six items and found that a two-dimensional model (three items for cognitive safety and three items for emotional safety) best suited the data. Correlational analyses suggested that the two components may have unique causes and consequences. In Study 2, using a different sample from Shenzhen (n = 352), confirmatory factor analysis consolidated the two-factor model. Further correlational analyses showed that the scale had good criterion-related validity. Across two studies, cognitive safety was related to perceived controllability, the tendency to seek new technologies, ICV driving experience, perceived government support, drive intention and intention to be other road users. Emotional safety was correlated with social support, familiarity, benefit perception, purchase and recommend intention. These results suggest that the scale developed in this study is a useful and reliable tool to measure perceived safety. Implications for future studies and relevant policies are discussed.}

Based on the framework, a set of algorithms are developed which are capable of detecting various traffic pre-events from traffic videos, such as speed violation, one-way traffic, overtaking, illegal parking, and wrong drop-off location of passengers. After detecting the pre-events, an alarm will be automatically generated in the control room which helps to take precautionary measures to avoid any potential mishap on road, thereby, improving the road safety. In previous studies, a single system can handle either one or two pre-events. Whereas, in our present study, five anomalies can be detected in a single system using five different algorithms. Our study further contributes to the detection of “wrong drop-off location of passengers”. The effectiveness of the developed algorithms is demonstrated over 132 traffic videos acquired from an integrated plant in India. Some additional comparative studies for overtaking and illegal parking are done using two benchmark datasets, namely ‘CamSeq01’ and ‘ISLab-PVD’. Through an extensive study, it can be concluded that our developed algorithms are superior to some state-of-the-art algorithms in the detection of pre-events on road.}

abstract = {Background
Protective helmets may reduce the risk of death and head injury in motorcycle collisions. However, there remains a large gap in knowledge regarding the effectiveness of different types of helmets in preventing injuries.
Objective
To explore and evaluate the effectiveness of different types of motorcycle helmets; that is the association between different helmet types and the incidence and severity of head, neck, and facial injuries among motorcyclists. Also, to explore the effect of different helmet types on riders.
Methods
A systematic search of different scientific databases was conducted from 1965 to April 2019. A scoping review was performed on the included articles. Eligible articles were included regarding defined criteria. Study characteristics, helmet types, fixation status, retention system, the prevention of injury or reduction of its severity were extracted.
Results
A total of 137 studies were included. There was very limited evidence for the better protection of full-face helmets from head and facial injury compared to open-face and half-coverage helmets. There was however scarce evidence for the superiority of a certain helmet type over others in terms of protection from neck injury. The retention system and the fixation status of helmets were two important factors affecting the risk of head and brain injury in motorcyclists. Helmets could also affect and limit the riders in terms of vision, hearing, and ventilation. Multiple solutions have been discussed to mitigate these effects.
Conclusion
Full-face helmets may protect head and face in motorcycle riders more than open-face and half-coverage helmets, but there is not enough evidence for better neck protection among these three helmet types. Helmets can affect the rider’s vision, hearing, and ventilation. When designing a helmet, all of these factors should be taken into account.}

There are two primary repositories of drug test information from fatal motor vehicle crashes in Maryland: (1) the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), which is a national crash database managed by the US Department of Transportation, and (2) the Maryland Medical Examiner (ME). In this study, we compared drug test information for people killed in crashes in Maryland between the FARS system and ME from 2006 – 2018. As ME records are the primary source for the FARS data from Maryland, these two data sets should be closely correlated. We used probabilistic linkage to match FARS and ME cases and compared matched cases by individual drug group. Matching was achieved on 83 % of cases (N = 4803 matched pairs). ME data consistently indicated higher overall incidence and trends in the presence of depressants, narcotics, and stimulants in crash deaths. Sensitivity analysis using both strict and relaxed matching criteria did not change this result. Road safety policy and prevention efforts for crashes involving drugs and alcohol require an accurate understanding of both long-term trends and year-to-year changes in drug prevalence. These findings demonstrate the potential value of using ME data as source of drug test information for crash deaths in the United States.}

The driver’s behavior is characterized by his or her driving style and plays an important role in traffic safety. This paper proposes a novel framework to classify driving styles (defined as aggressive, normal, and cautious) based on online car-hailing data to investigate the distinct characteristics of drivers when performing various driving tasks (defined as cruising, ride requests, and drop-off) and undergoing certain maneuvers (defined as turning, acceleration, and deceleration). The proposed model is constructed based on the detection and classification of driving maneuvers using a threshold-based endpoint detection approach, principal component analysis, and k-means clustering. The driving styles that the driver exhibits for the different driving tasks are compared and analyzed based on the classified maneuvers. The empirical results for Nanjing, China demonstrate that the proposed framework can detect driving maneuvers and classify driving styles accurately. Moreover, according to this framework, driving tasks lead to variations in driving style, and the variations in driving style during the different driving tasks differ significantly for turning, acceleration, and deceleration maneuvers.}

abstract = {Applications of neuroimaging methods have substantially contributed to the scientific understanding of human factors during driving by providing a deeper insight into the neuro-cognitive aspects of driver brain. This has been achieved by conducting simulated (and occasionally, field) driving experiments while collecting driver brain signals of various types. Here, this sector of studies is comprehensively reviewed at both macro and micro scales. At the macro scale, bibliometric aspects of these studies are analysed. At the micro scale, different themes of neuroimaging driving behaviour research are identified and the findings within each theme are synthesised. The surveyed literature has reported on applications of four major brain imaging methods. These include Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Electroencephalography (EEG), Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG), with the first two being the most common methods in this domain. While collecting driver fMRI signal has been particularly instrumental in studying neural correlates of intoxicated driving (e.g. alcohol or cannabis) or distracted driving, the EEG method has been predominantly utilised in relation to the efforts aiming at development of automatic fatigue/drowsiness detection systems, a topic to which the literature on neuro-ergonomics of driving particularly has shown a spike of interest within the last few years. The survey also reveals that topics such as driver brain activity in semi-automated settings or neural activity of drivers with brain injuries or chronic neurological conditions have by contrast been investigated to a very limited extent. Potential topics in driving behaviour research are identified that could benefit from the adoption of neuroimaging methods in future studies. In terms of practicality, while fMRI and MEG experiments have proven rather invasive and technologically challenging for adoption in driving behaviour research, EEG and fNIRS applications have been more diverse. They have even been tested beyond simulated driving settings, in field driving experiments. Advantages and limitations of each of these four neuroimaging methods in the context of driving behaviour experiments are outlined in the paper.}

Hence, providing accurate and timely prediction of the severity of traffic collisions at work zones is vital to reduce the response time for emergency units (e.g., medical aid), accordingly improve traffic safety and reduce congestion. In predicting the severity of traffic collisions, previous studies used different statistical and machine learning models with accuracy as the main evaluating factor. However, the performance of these models was generally not good, especially on fatal and injury crashes. Also, looking into the prediction accuracy only is misleading. This paper aims to propose a novel deep learning-based approach with a customized f1-loss function to predict the severity of traffic crashes. Underlying this objective is to compare the results of deep learning models with machine learning model considering two performance indicators, namely precision, and recall. The data used in the analysis include a sample of traffic crashes that occurred at work zones in Louisiana from 2014 to 2018. This dataset includes valuable information (features) related to road, vehicle, and human factors affecting the occurrence and severity of those crashes. The proposed methodology is based on transforming these features/variables into images. Image transformation is conducted using a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique t-SNE and convex hull algorithm. A CNN based deep learning algorithm with a customized loss function was used to directly optimize the model for precision and recall. The results showed improved performance in predicting the crash severity of fatal and injury crashes using the deep learning approach, which can help to improve traffic safety as well as traffic congestion at work zones and possibly other roadways segments.}

Changes over time in government effectiveness (one of the indicators of the World Governance Index developed by the World Bank) are weakly associated with changes in road safety performance.}

The aim is to evaluate whether pedelec single accidents have specific causes that have not yet been recorded in the official accident statistics. Results show that most cases can be assigned to categories addressing the user (60 %) or the road design (54 %, accidents can be assigned to several categories). With this dataset it is also possible to analyse the severity of injuries using ordered probit analysis. Of the nine categories where severe injuries are expected, most address the user. In addition, serious injuries are expected when problems are encountered on downhill slopes or involve technical faults. An additional ordered probit analysis with a second dataset, based on different sources but using the same categorisation, supports these results.}

Identifying high-risk segments not only benefits safety specialists to better understand crash patterns but also reminds road users to be aware of driving risks. This study reports on a new crowdsourcing solution to identify high-risk highway segments by analyzing driving jerks. Driving jerks represent the abrupt changes of acceleration, which have been shown to be closely related to traffic risks. In this study, we first calculate driving jerks from each participant’s naturalistic driving data and identify “unsafe” drivers based on their jerk-ratio. Then, we innovatively propose an improved line-constrained clustering method to identify each participant’s jerk clusters on each road. These individual-specific jerk clusters are overlapped with road networks to identify potential risky segments. By synthesizing these potential risky segments reported by different participants, we obtain the final detection results for high-risk highway segments. In this study, we compare the jerk-cluster-determined risky segments with crash-rate-determined risky segments to evaluate the proposed solution’s effectiveness. The study results demonstrate that our crowdsourcing solution can effectively identify high-risk road segments with an estimated 75 % accuracy. More importantly, by analyzing this valued surrogate measure, safety specialists can identify hazardous road segments before crashes occur.}

As the number and proportion of older adults grows in many countries, and awareness of the benefits of active travel becomes increasingly evident, it behooves researchers to further investigate the safety of older pedestrians. This study contributes to the literature by examining the factors that influence older adults’ susceptibility to pedestrian incidents (falls incidents and pedestrian-vehicle collisions). To this end, a sample of older adults living in the Greater Golden Horseshoe, South Ontario, Canada was surveyed. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), to identify several latent factors that are significantly associated with older adults’ involvement in pedestrian incidents. The results revealed that the factors that affect older adults’ susceptibility to pedestrian incidents are level of difficulty while walking, fear of falling, and crossing evaluation capability. In contrast, level of pedestrian confidence and level of risk-taking crossing behavior are not among the significant factors. It was also found that older pedestrians aged 65–75 years, males, and those who are still working had a greater probability to be involved in pedestrian incidents. These findings shed light on some key constraints of older pedestrians, and the extent to which each factor could improve their safety. This information, in turn, can be used by transportation authorities in prioritizing their plans, policies, and programs towards improving the safety and mobility of older pedestrians.}

abstract = {Despite the relevance of road crashes and their impact on social and health care costs, the effects of extreme temperatures on road crashes risk have been scarcely investigated, particularly for those occurring in occupational activities. A nationwide epidemiological study was carried out to estimate the risk of general indistinct and work-related road crashes related with extreme temperatures and to identify crash and occupation parameters mostly involved. Data about road crashes, resulting in death or injury, occurring during years 2013–2015 in Italy, were collected from the National Institute of Statistics, for general indistinct road crashes, and from the compensation claim applications registered by the national workers' compensation authority, for work-related ones. Time series of hourly temperature were derived from the results provided by the meteorological model WRF applied at a national domain with 5 km resolution. To consider the different spatial-temporal characteristics of the two road crashes archives, the association with extreme temperatures was estimated by means of a case-crossover time-stratified approach using conditional logistic regression analysis, and a time-series analysis, using over-dispersed Poisson generalized linear regression model, for general indistinct and work-related datasets respectively. The analyses were controlled for other covariates and confounding variables (including precipitation). Non-linearity and lag effects were considered by using a distributed lag non-linear model. Relative risks were calculated for increment from 75th to 99th percentiles (hot) and from 25 to first percentile (cold) of temperature. Results for general indistinct crashes show a positive association with hot temperature (RR = 1.12, 95 % CI: 1.09–1.16) and a negative one for cold (RR = 0.93, 95 % CI: 0.91−0.96), while for work-related crashes a positive association was found for both hot and cold (RR = 1.06 (95 % CI: 1.01–1.11) and RR = 1.10 (95 % CI: 1.05–1.16). The use of motorcycles, the location of accident (urban vs out of town), presence of crossroads, as well as occupational factors like the use of a vehicle on duty were all found to produce higher risks of road crashes during extreme temperatures. Mitigation and prevention measures are needed to limit social and health care costs.}

abstract = {With the development of technology in the world, vehicles that reach high speeds are produced. In addition, with the increase of road width and quality, faster and more comfortable transportation can be provided. These developments also increase the speed violation rates of road vehicles. Drivers who violate speed limits can endanger both their own lives and the lives of others. Speed violations, of especially heavy vehicles, involve much greater risks than that of light vehicles. Heavy vehicles can cause more serious losses of lives and property in accidents, compared to the ones caused by light vehicles, as they can carry much more freight or passengers than light vehicles. In this study, data regarding the speed violations committed by heavy vehicles in Turkey, were used. Speed violations were divided into 10 classes according to the intensity of speed violation rates. After this process, all provinces were classified according to support vector machines (SVM), naive bayes (NB) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithms. When the accuracy values and error scales of all three algorithms are examined, it has been determined that the algorithm that gives the most accurate results is the NB algorithm. Based on the classification of this algorithm, speed violation density maps of types of heavy vehicles in Turkey were created by using spatial analysis. According to the density maps, the provinces with the highest speed violations were identified. In the results, it was determined that the rate of heavy vehicle speed violation was highest in the cities such as Erzurum, Konya, and Muğla. Later, these cities were examined in terms of heavy vehicle mobility. At the end of this study, measures were proposed to reduce these violations in cities where speeding violations are intense. Material and moral damages can be prevented, to a great extent, with the implementation of recommendations of policymakers which can reduce speed violations.}

abstract = {In the past decade, the number of road traffic accidents and fatalities has remained about the same level. One of strategies to protect vulnerable road users (VRUs) is to analyze the factors that cause traffic accident and then to deploy safety facilities. However, most traffic safety systems currently in operation rely on historical data, which is post-facto approach. Thus, it is necessary to prevent accident in advance and to respond in proactive manner before the accident. In this study, we propose a framework for potential pedestrian risk analysis using a multi-dimensional on-line analytical processing (OLAP), called SafetyCube, which enables decision-makers to understand the situations by scrutinizing interactive behaviors between vehicle and pedestrian. First, we collect the behavioral features of traffic-related objects (e.g., vehicles and pedestrians) extracted from closed circuit televisions (CCTVs) deployed on crosswalks throughout the overall urban, and accumulate them in a data warehouse over an extended period in order to construct a data cube model. Then, we conduct comprehensive analyses in multi-dimensional perspective using OLAP operations by varying the abstraction levels. Our analytical experiments are based on three scenarios, and the results show that the vehicle’s movement patterns before entering the crosswalk, patterns of changes in speed of vehicles approaching to pedestrians, and so on. Through these results from the proposed analytical system, decision-makers can gain a better understanding of how the vehicles and pedestrians behave near the crosswalk by visualizing their interactions. Further, these insights would be reflected to improve the road environment safer. In order to validate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed system, we apply it to various crosswalks in Osan city, South Korea.}

abstract = {Background
Feeling unsafe when riding a bicycle is a key barrier to cycling participation. To better understand the experiences of cycling on-road, this study aimed to explore the relationship between cyclists’ subjective experiences and the lateral passing distance of motor vehicles.
Methods
An on-road observational study was conducted in Victoria, Australia. Participants had a custom device installed on their bicycle that measured the lateral passing distance of motor vehicles and included a handlebar mounted “panic button” that participants could press when they felt that a passing event was too close or unsafe. A random effects logistic regression model was used to investigate the relationship between cyclist sex, motor vehicle type and infrastructure characteristics, and button press events.
Results
A total of 217 button press events were recorded (1.2 % of all passing events) from 60 participants. For events with a passing distance closer than 100 cm, 10.4 % of these events had a recorded button press. The adjusted odds of a button press event were over three-fold higher when the rider was passed by a truck, compared to when the rider was passed by a sedan. The predicted probability of a button press event was higher in events occurring in road environments with no bike lane and no parked cars (1.9 %) compared to no bike lane with parked cars (1.2 %), a bike lane with no parked cars (0.9 %) and a bike lane with parked cars (0.7 %).
Conclusions
The study identified important links between cyclists’ subjective experience of unsafe events, motor vehicle types and infrastructure characteristics. Greater emphasis needs to be placed on capturing subjective experiences to inform and advance the development and implementation of safe and comfortable cycling infrastructure.}

Out of the 1453 survey responses that were received, 650 complete and valid responses were used to analyze the respondents’ stated acceptance of and expected behavioral responses to the two connected vehicle applications under a variety of scenarios. Statistical analyses were conducted to examine the influence of demographic and socioeconomic factors. The results reveal that the respondents express high willingness to use connected vehicle technology and the two applications under various circumstances, and the willingness is strongly associated with age, gender, education level, and income. Higher levels of acceptance are observed in older, male, higher-educated, or higher-income respondents, while the patterns of conditional acceptance and expected behavioral responses vary with specific scenarios. These results provide useful information for application developers, traffic operators, and policy makers to steer connected vehicle technology development and deployment in the direction that will benefit both the users and the society.}

abstract = {The main objective of this paper was to analyse the roadway, environmental, and driver-related factors associated with an overrepresentation of frequency and severity of run-off-the-road (ROR) crashes. The data used in this study refer to the 6167 crashes occurred in the section Naples–Candela of A16 motorway, Italy in the period from 2001 to 2011. The analysis was carried out using the rule discovery technique due to its ability of extracting knowledge from large amounts of data previously unknown and indistinguishable by investigating patterns that occur together in a given event. The rules were filtered by support, confidence, lift, and validated by the lift increase criterion. A two-step analysis was carried out. In the first step, rules discovering factors contributing to ROR crashes were identified. In the second step, studying only ROR crashes, rules discovering factors contributing to severe and fatal injury (KSI) crashes were identified. As a result, 94 significant rules for ROR crashes and 129 significant rules for KSI crashes were identified. These rules represent several combinations of geometric design, roadside, barrier performance, crash dynamic, vehicle, environmental and drivers’ characteristics associated with an overrepresentation of frequency and severity of ROR crashes. From the methodological point of view, study results show that the a priori algorithm was effective in providing new information which was previously hidden in the data. Finally, several countermeasures to solve or mitigate the safety issues identified in this study were discussed. It is worthwhile to observe that the study showed a combination of factors contributing to the overrepresentation of frequency and severity of ROR crashes. Consequently, the implementation of a combination of countermeasures is recommended.}

This level of aggregation obscures critical information. Here, a new approach to organizing non-aggregated data is taken, and logistic regression and random forest models are applied to non-aggregated FMCSA roadside inspection, violation, and crash data at the specific vehicle level. Resampling methods are used to improve model performance where there are relatively few events of interest—crashes. These results point not to specific “unsafe” drivers, but rather, patterns of unsafe behaviors or conditions that predict roadway crashes. Working toward reducing these behaviors systematically could save lives on US highways.}

abstract = {Safety assessment among sleep-deprived drivers is a challenging research area with only a few sleep-related studies investigating safety performance during car-following. Therefore, this study aimed to measure the effects of partial sleep deprivation on driver safety during car-following. Fifty healthy male drivers with no prior history of any sleep-related disorders, drove the driving simulator in three conditions of varying sleep duration: a baseline (no sleep deprivation), test session (TS1) after one night of PSD (sleep ≤4.5 h/night) and TS2 after two consecutive nights of PSD. The reduced sleep in PSD sessions was monitored using an Actiwatch. Karolinska Sleepiness Scale was used to indicate loss of alertness among drivers. Each drive included a car-following task to measure longitudinal safety indicators based on speed and headway management: normalized time exposed to critical gap (TECG’), safety critical time headway and speed variability with respect to leading vehicle’s speed (SPV). Crash potential index (CPI) was also determined from deceleration rate of drivers during car-following and was found correlated with other indicators. Therefore, to determine the aggregate influence of PSD on safety during car-following, CPI was modelled in terms of TECG, SPV, THW and other covariates. All safety metrics were modelled using generalized mixed effects regression models. The results showed that compared to the baseline drive, critical time headway decreased by 0.65 and 1.08 times whereas speed variability increased by 1.34 and 1.28 times during the TS1 and TS2, respectively, both indicating higher crash risk. However, decrease in TECG’ by 64 % and 56 % during TS1 and TS2, respectively indicate compensatory measures to avoid risks due to sleep loss. A fractional regression model of crash potential revealed that low time-headway and higher speed variability and high time exposed to critical gap (TECG’) significantly contribute to higher CPI values indicating higher safety risk. Other covariates such as sleep duration, professional driving experience and history of traffic violations were also associated with safety indicators and CPI, however no significant effects of age were noticed in the study. The study findings present the safety indicators sensitive to rear-end crashes specifically under PSD conditions, which can be used in designing collisions avoidance systems and strategies to improve overall traffic safety.}

The objectives of FSP are to minimize the incident duration and increase safety at the incident scene. The current research explored the safety benefits of Florida’s FSP program known as Road Rangers – harnessed from lowering the likelihood of secondary crashes (SCs) – compared to other responding agencies. The analysis was done on 6088 incidents that occurred on freeways in Jacksonville, Florida, from 2015 through 2017. Since SCs were not explicitly identified in the SunGuide® incident database, the study adopted a data-driven technique that used BlueToad® speed data to identify them. Once SCs were identified, a model was developed to identify factors influencing their occurrence. Factors such as an increase in equivalent hourly traffic volume, incident impact duration, and the percent of lanes closed significantly increased the likelihood of a SC. Besides, moderate/severe incidents, crash events, weekdays, peak hours, shoulder blockage, and incidents involving towing showed a high likelihood of resulting in a SC. Of practical importance, the model results revealed that a minute increase in incident impact duration increased the SC probability by 1.2 percent, with other factors held constant. Based on a 16-minutes decrease in incident impact duration, the Road Rangers program could lessen the probability of SCs by 21 percent, compared to other agencies. These findings could be beneficial to incident managers, responders, and researchers in evaluating the program’s performance.}

abstract = {Pedestrians are vulnerable when crossing the street, especially at non-signalized crosswalks. In China, in spite of the priority that laws entitle the pedestrians, the yielding rates at non-signalized crosswalks are relatively low. In light of this situation, law enforcement cameras have been used to increase the percentage of drivers yielding to pedestrians. This study investigates the effectiveness of law enforcement cameras on drivers yielding behavior and vehicle-pedestrian conflicts at non-signalized crosswalks. Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and roadside video recording, information including pedestrian characteristics, vehicular characteristics and environmental factors are collected. The conflict indicators used include Post-Encroachment Time (PET), Time to Collision (TTC), and Deceleration to Safety Time (DST). In this study, a conflict classification framework based on PET, TTC and DST using Support Vector Machine algorithm is employed. A multinomial logit regression model is used to identify the factors contributing to the conflicts. Then, binary logit regression models are constructed to analyze the effects of law enforcement cameras on drivers yielding behavior. Conflict study reveals that the implementation of law enforcement cameras would increase the probability of slight conflict but decrease the probability of serious conflict. Yielding behavior analysis shows that the illegitimate yielding behavior percentages are over 10 %, indicating the necessity of improving the awareness of yielding rules, and the implementation of law enforcement cameras would increase the yielding and legitimate yielding probability. Moreover, factors including the adjacent vehicle yielding behavior, number of lanes between pedestrian and vehicle, pedestrian speed change, pedestrian waiting time, pedestrian accepted gap time, vehicle upstream speed and vehicle speed change are significantly associated with conflict severity and drivers yielding behavior. We recommend that supplementary facilities and measures should be used to improve the safety performance of law enforcement cameras.}

By taking into account temporal stability and unobserved heterogeneity, this study investigates the determinants of the injury severity of drivers involved in crashes at unsignalized intersections controlled by give-way (yield) signs. Mixed logit models with three approaches were employed, namely random parameters, random parameters with heterogeneity in means, and random parameters with heterogeneity in means and variances. The investigation covered four years (2015–2018) of motor vehicle crashes in South Australia, and the injury severity was categorized into no injury, minor injury, and severe injury. Log-likelihood ratio tests revealed that there is a significant temporal instability in the four years of crashes. Thus, each year was considered separately to avoid any potential erroneous conclusions and unreliable countermeasures. The study found 28 indicator variables were temporally unstable over the four years of crashes, such as driver gender, time of the crash, rear-end involvement, sideswipes, right-angle crash type, vehicle movement at crash time, and crash time. Whereas several variables were stable over the same period, for example, crashes within metropolitan areas were temporally stable over four years, crashes in dry pavement condition were temporally stable over three consecutive years. Four factors have temporal stability over two consecutive years: alcohol involvement crashes, hitting fixed objects, hitting cyclists, and crashes during winter. Overall, mixed logit models with heterogeneity in means and with/without variance performed better than the standard one. It is recommended that temporal instability be considered in order to avoid any potential inconsistent countermeasures.}

We surveyed ADAS owners (N = 102) and non-owners (N = 262), with the primary objective of assessing knowledge and trust of ACC and LKA, and investigating the relationship between knowledge and trust among drivers who have not received special training. The survey contained demographic questions, ACC and LKA knowledge questionnaires (assessing knowledge of capabilities and limitations commonly found in owner’s manuals), and ACC and LKA trust ratings. From the knowledge questionnaires, sensitivity (i.e., knowledge of the true capabilities of ACC and LKA) and response bias were assessed and used to predict trust. Results showed that owners did not have better knowledge of system capabilities/limitations than non-owners, in fact, owners had a stronger bias in favour of system capabilities. For non-owners, better knowledge of system capabilities was associated with lower trust, and those who were more biased towards endorsing system capabilities had higher trust. Neither knowledge nor response bias was associated with trust among owners. Further research is needed to confirm our results with a larger sample of owners, but given that it is also impractical to expect drivers to learn and remember all possible ADAS limitations, it may be beneficial to focus training efforts on improving drivers’ overall understanding of the fallibility of ADAS and reinforcing their role when using ADAS to support appropriate trust and reliance.}

In this paper we examine whether crash involvement among 17-year-old unlicensed drivers changed after post-licence accompanied driving from the age of 17 was allowed in Denmark in 2017. The study includes police-registered crashes occurring three years before and three years after the change (2014–2019). Results show an increase in crash involvement among 17-year-olds and a small increase in crash involvement among unlicensed 17-year-olds, if population size is taken into account, but no differences in the crash and person characteristics before and after the change. Being male, speeding, and impairment at the time of the crash predicted unlicensed crash involvement. A latent class clustering analysis (LCCA) identified seven clusters of crashes involving an unlicensed 17-year-old. The cluster characteristics reveal different patterns in the associated factors such as females and parked vehicles being more likely to be included in C1, alcohol impaired in C2 and drug impaired in C7. Brief crash descriptions provided by the police indicate that driving with extra motives such as showing-off or pleasure are prevalent in all clusters. Results confirm, that unlicensed crash involvement among 17-year olds is associated with risk-taking behaviours such as speeding, impaired driving, showing-off, and the car being pursued by the police. However, unfortunate manoeuvres and loss of control of the vehicle possibly related to poor driving skills are also associated with the crashes. Crash characteristics such as impairment by alcohol and drugs indicate that unlicensed crash involvement is a distinct safety challenge associated with health risk behaviours rather than a transport related need for a driver’s license. Additional studies exploring the motivations and circumstances associated with unlicensed driving among 17-year olds are needed along with measures to prevent car access among unlicensed youth..}

abstract = {The incidence of traffic accidents in Japan has been decreasing annually. Nineteen percent of all accidents involve bicycles, with 51 % of these accidents being at road crossing intersections. Therefore, to reduce the number of accidents, this study analyses driving and cycling characteristics and proposes suitable collisions prevention methods. First, the study measured traffic environment variables using video cameras at a target non-signalized intersection and analyzed the speed and time to intersection of bicycles and motor vehicles. Thus, 47 dangerous situations were observed via the video analysis, and most of these situations occurred when the vehicle’s time to intersection ranged from 0.50 to 0.75 s and the bicycle’s speed ranged from 2.0–3.0 m/s. Second, using the results of video camera analysis as experimental parameters (e.g., the speed and timing of the presence of the bicycle), this study conducted an experiment with a driving simulator to investigate the effect of warning drivers about the risk of collision. A driver support system was then utilized to provide acoustic and optical warnings to drivers. The experiments revealed that the motor vehicle time to the anticipated collision point (V-TTC) increased with the use of a driver support system. Significant differences between experiments with and without driver support systems were observed when the calculated time between the bicycle and the motor vehicle was 0.25 and 0.50 s. Therefore, when the calculated time was 0.25 and 0.50 s, a driver support system, indicating the presence of a bicycle, was effective in preventing an intersection collision.}

The data were collected for one hour at each midblock crossing during the evening peak hour between 5.00–6.00 p.m. Three synchronized cameras were used to record pedestrian crossings. Then, by using image processing, vehicle and pedestrian trajectories have been obtained. Two cameras were mounted on telescopic tripods reaching up to 9 m, and the third camera was used to identify pedestrians’ gender better. The parameters extracted from the recordings are; pedestrians’ gender, group size, whether they carried items or not, and their accepted/rejected gaps. Pedestrian and item detection has been performed by YOLOv3 and YOLACT models. The accepted and rejected time gaps were extracted for pedestrians, excluding the pedestrians who crossed between stopped vehicles and crossed when an approaching vehicle did not exist within 100 m from the midblock crossing. Raff’s method was used to estimate the critical gap using accepted/rejected gaps. The critical gaps ranged between 4.1 s and 6.2 s. The 15th percentile crossing speeds were found to be similar, ranging between 0.78 m/s and 0.80 m/s.}

Many research efforts have focused on high-volume roadways that typically experience more crashes. A few studies have documented SPFs for non-federal aid system (NFAS) roads including rural minor collectors, rural local roads, and urban local roads. NFAS roads are characterized by unique features such as lower speeds, and shorter segment lengths, and they usually experience fewer crashes given the low exposure of these roads. As a result, there is a clear need to investigate the associated safety issues of NFAS roadways and generate distinct SPFs for them. The main objective of this study is to bridge the gap in the literature and develop SPFs for NFAS roads. This study examined the application of traditional negative binomial and zero-favored negative binomial models (i.e., negative binomial-Lindley). Both groups of models were formulated by different variance and dispersion structures. Using crash, roadway inventory, and traffic volume data from 2014 to 2018 in Virginia, the results showed that the NB-L models perform better than the traditional NB models. Furthermore, an appropriate variance structure along with a reasonably chosen dispersion function can further improve the model performance.}

These systems pre-dominantly employ two components-sensors placed near the work zone perimeter that detect intrusions, and alarms placed closed to or carried by the workers that alerts them. This study investigates the association between layout of these components for three WZIAS on work zone crashes based on worker reaction. Also, the key determinants of work zone crashes in presence of the WZIAS is identified using survival analysis. The ideal deployment strategy and use case scenarios for the three WZIAS is presented based on the findings of the study. The systems were subjected to rigorous testing that emulated intrusions to record worker reaction and determine occurrence of crashes. Analysis of results indicate that the key determinants of work zone crashes are speed of the intruding vehicle, distance between the sensor and worker, and accuracy of a system in detecting intrusions and alerting workers. Results from field experiments suggest that identification of appropriate use cases for WZIAS is necessary to ensure they work effectively. Based on the findings from this study it is suggested that current guidelines on work zones be modified to standardize WZIAS setup.}

One promising direction of tackling this challenge is to take advantage of telematics data, increasingly available from connected vehicle technology, to obtain dense risk predictors. In this work, we propose a decision-adjusted framework to develop optimal driver risk prediction models using telematics-based driving behavior information. We apply the proposed framework to identify the optimal threshold values for elevated longitudinal acceleration (ACC), deceleration (DEC), lateral acceleration (LAT), and other model parameters for predicting driver risk. The Second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2) naturalistic driving data were used with the decision rule of identifying the top 1% to 20% of the riskiest drivers. The results show that the decision-adjusted model improves prediction precision by 6.3% to 26.1% compared to a baseline model using non-telematics predictors. The proposed model is superior to models based on a receiver operating characteristic curve criterion, with 5.3% and 31.8% improvement in prediction precision. The results confirm that the optimal thresholds for ACC, DEC and LAT are sensitive to the decision rules, especially when predicting a small percentage of high-risk drivers. This study demonstrates the value of kinematic driving behavior in crash risk prediction and the necessity for a systematic approach for extracting prediction features. The proposed method can benefit broad applications, including fleet safety management, use-based insurance, driver behavior intervention, as well as connected-vehicle safety technology development.}

abstract = {The availability of large-scale naturalistic driving data provides enormous opportunities for studying relationships between instantaneous driving decisions prior to involvement in safety critical events (SCEs). This study investigates the role of driving instability prior to involvement in SCEs. While past research has studied crash types and their contributing factors, the role of pre-crash behavior in such events has not been explored as extensively. The research demonstrates how measures and analysis of driving volatility can be leading indicators of crashes and contribute to enhancing safety. Highly detailed microscopic data from naturalistic driving are used to provide the analytic framework to rigorously analyze the behavioral dimensions and driving instability that can lead to different types of SCEs such as roadway departures, rear end collisions, and sideswipes. Modeling results reveal a positive association between volatility and involvement in SCEs. Specifically, increases in both lateral and longitudinal volatilities represented by Bollinger bands and vehicular jerk lead to higher likelihoods of involvement in SCEs. Further, driver behavior related factors such as aggressive driving and lane changing also increases the likelihood of involvement in SCEs. Driver distraction, as represented by the duration of secondary tasks, also increases the risk of SCEs. Likewise, traffic flow parameters play a critical role in safety risk. The risk of involvement in SCEs decreases under free flow traffic conditions and increases under unstable traffic flow. Further, the model shows prediction accuracy of 88.1 % and 85.7 % for training and validation data. These results have implications for proactive safety and providing in-vehicle warnings and alerts to prevent the occurrence of such SCEs.}

abstract = {Cyclists are vulnerable road users who are more likely than others to be involved and injured in accidents and crashes. To enhance cyclists’ safety, governments around the world have introduced bicycle passing distance laws, yet research into the effectiveness of these laws is still limited. This study examines the changes in driver behaviour (passing distance, aggressive behaviour) and negative attitudes towards cyclists, as well as cyclist numbers on the roads following the introduction of a cyclist minimum passing distance law in Western Australia in 2017. The study employs a quasi-experimental design using self-reported survey data on driver behaviour and attitudes from two independent samples collected before (N 2016 = 302) and after (N 2020 = 426) the introduction of the law. Average daily cyclist numbers per month were retrieved from Western Australia’s Mainroads Government Agency for 35 cycle counters on shared paths (803 data entries prior to the law and 737 data entries post its’s introduction) and one cycle counter on a road in the CBD of the state capital (data entries for 349 days pre-law and 657 days post-law). Results showed that the introduction of the law was followed by an increase in self-reported passing distances by car drivers. However, the results also indicated that aggressive behaviour and negative attitudes towards cyclists had increased between 2016 and 2020, while cycling numbers remained stable. Taken together, the results indicate that the cyclist minimum passing distance law effectively addresses its targeted outcome, while it appears less effective and potentially counterproductive in addressing attitudes, related behaviours and cycling numbers in the short term. The findings have implications for policy makers looking to introduce cyclist minimum passing distance laws. Specifically, such laws may need to be rigorously enforced and to be accompanied with other interventions targeted at changing attitudes and norms concerning cyclists.}

Specifically, a safety prediction model provides a decision reference for the trajectory planning system in the pre-crash phase and the adaptive restraint system in the in-crash phase. The main goal of the current study is to construct a data-driven, vehicle kinematic feature-based model to realize accurate and near real-time prediction of in-vehicle occupant injury severity. A large-scale numerical database was established focusing on occupant kinetics. A first-step deep-learning model was established to predict occupant kinetics and injury severity using a convolutional neural network (CNN). To reduce the computational time for real-time application, the second step was to extract simplified kinematic features from vehicle crash pulses via a feature extraction method, which was inspired by a visualization approach applied to the CNN-based model. The features were incorporated with a low-complexity machine-learning algorithm and achieved satisfactory accuracy (85.4 % on the numerical database, 78.7 % on a 192-case real-world dataset) and decreased computational time (1.2 ± 0.4 ms) on the prediction tasks. This study demonstrated the feasibility of using data-driven and feature-based approaches to achieve accurate injury risk estimation prior to collision. The proposed model is expected to provide a decision reference for integrated safety systems in the next generation of automated vehicles.}

In developing these models, little attention has been paid to those functional forms that reflect the reality that CMFs should not be single-valued, as most available ones are, but should vary with application circumstance. Using a full Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, this study aimed to improve the functional forms used to derive CMFs in cross-sectional regression models, with a focus on capturing the variability inherent in crash modification functions (CMFunctions). The estimated CMFunction for target crashes for freeway median width, used for a case study, indicates that the approach is capable of developing a function that can capture the logical reality that the CMF for a given change in a feature’s value depends not only on the amount of the change but also on the original value. The results highlight the importance of using the functional forms that can capture non-linear effects of road attributes for CMF estimation in cross-sectional models. The case study provides credible CMFs for assessing the safety implications of decisions on freeway median width that could be used in improving current design practice.}

At present, these systems are able to control some portions of the driving task (e.g., braking, steering) for extended time periods, giving drivers the opportunity to disengage from the responsibilities associated with driving. In this study, data derived from two naturalistic driving studies involving automation-equipped vehicles were analyzed to evaluate driver behaviors with respect to driving automation system use, specifically distraction-related factors (i.e., secondary task engagement, eye-glance behavior, and drowsiness). The results indicate that when drivers had prior experience using driving automation systems, they were almost two times as likely to participate in distracted driving behaviors when the systems were active than during manual driving. Drivers with less experience and familiarity with driving automation systems were less likely to drive distracted when the systems were active; however, these drivers tended to be somewhat drowsy when driving with systems activated. The results provide important insights into different operational phases of driving automation system use (i.e., learning/unfamiliar vs experienced users), whereby experience results in overtrust and overreliance on the advanced technologies, which subsequently may negate some of the safety benefits of these systems. Thus, while the safety benefits of driving automation systems are evident, it is imperative to better understand the impact these advanced technologies may have on driver behavior and performance in order to evaluate and address any unintended consequences associated with system use.}

However, the optimal observation time window length and prediction time window length, which should be the prerequisite for the timeliness and accuracy of real-time driving risk status prediction model, have been rarely explored in previous studies. In this study, a methodology which integrates driving risk status identification, rolling time window-based feature extraction, real-time driving risk status prediction and driving risk influencing factors analysis was proposed to accurately evaluate and predict real-time driving risk status. The methodology was tested based on 1,440 car-following events from Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study. Results show that four driving risk statuses (safe, low-risk, median-risk and high-risk) are most appropriate to establish risk labelling criteria. In addition, results from driving risk status prediction show that when the observation time window length is 0.5 s, the accuracy rate of predicting medium-risk or high-risk status occurring in the next 0.7 s is higher than 85 % using multi-layer perceptron model. Meanwhile, the results from the analysis of influencing factors show that the input variables related to the risk status score higher in the ranking of feature importance. A part from that, speed difference, headway distance, speed and acceleration are still important in predicting driving risk status. The proposed methods in this paper can be applied in connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) to reduce driver cognitive workload and hence improve driving safety fed with naturalistic driving data collected using in-vehicle systems.}

We used a before-after control group design, surveying people who did (EG) and who did not (CG) participate in the group intervention. The sample (n = 126) consisted of 80 men and 46 women with a mean age of 54 years (SD = 13). In addition, a sub-sample (n = 37) participated in a driving simulator study before and after the intervention. To enrich the survey- and simulator-based findings, we conducted a focus group discussion about post-intervention experiences in traffic. Comparisons of pre and post survey results showed that constructive expression as measured by a slightly revised sub-scale of the Driving Anger Expression Inventory (DAX-short), increased significantly for EG participants but not within the CG. In addition, the involvement in milder forms of road anger (e.g., yelling) decreased significantly in the EG but not in the CG. In the simulator study, we observed that EG participants decreased the extent of aggressive driving, commenting and gesturing – however, none of these differences were statistically significant. EG participants self-assessed the intervention overall positive and 44 % reported that they had changed their way of thinking or reacting in traffic. Overall, results indicate a positive effect of the cognitive-behavioural group intervention. Study limitations, possibilities to improve the intervention and different areas of application are discussed.}

Understanding the risky behaviors, psychological failures and kinematics in vehicle-to-PTW accidents is an important first step in addressing this issue. Here 69 vehicle-to-PTW accidents captured on video from the Traffic Accident Investigation and Research in China (TAIRC) database are selected and reconstructed. All accidents are categorized into different crash scenarios using a harmonized method. Accident causations are identified from the perspectives of praxeology and psychology. Kinematics characteristics, such as impact speed and relative position, are also analyzed. The results show the crossing accident bundle is the most frequent followed by rear, oncoming and run-up accident bundles, with proportions of 43.48 %, 27.54 %, 11.59 % and 17.39 % respectively. Accident causations of different crash scenarios have great differences whether in accident responsibilities or in psychological failures. For instance, the PTW riders who violate the traffic regulations need to be mainly responsible for most crossing accidents, whereas most rear accidents are blamed on drivers who fail to properly check their mirrors when they turn, turn around or change lanes. From the perspective of psychology, the perception failures encountered by both drivers and riders are a typical causation in crossing accidents, while it is a contributing factor in rear accidents that a failure of prognosis from the rider combined with a failure of perception from the driver. Visual obstruction exists widely in crossing and oncoming accident bundles. The impact speeds of vehicles and PTWs are often less than 40 km/h in all accident bundles. A wider sensing area (field of view = 90°, view detection range = 35 m) should be achieved to more effectively detect the conflict PTWs. These findings about vehicle-PTW accidents provide a stronger support for the development of prevention countermeasures and advanced driver assistance system.}

This research investigated the use of SHRP2 Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) data to assess infrastructure and other factors contributing to left turn crashes at signalized intersections, and how to improve older driver safety during such turns. NDS data for trips involving signalized intersections and crash or near-crash events were obtained for two driver age groups: drivers age 65 and over (older drivers) and a sample of drivers age 30−49, along with NDS pre-screening and questionnaire data. Video scoring of all trips was performed to collect additional information on intersection and trip conditions. To identify the most influential factors of crash risk during left turns at signalized intersections, machine learning and regression models were used. The results found that in the obtained NDS dataset, there was a relatively small volume of crashes during left turns at signalized intersections. Further, model results found the statistically significant variables of crash risk for older drivers were associated more with health and cognitive factors rather than the infrastructure or design of the intersections. The results suggest that a study using only SHRP2 NDS data will not lead to definitive findings or recommendations for infrastructure changes to increase safety for older drivers at signalized intersections and during left turns. Moreover, the findings of this study indicates the need to consider other data sources and data collection methods to address this critical literature gap in older driver safety.}

An interrupted time-series analysis was used to assess whether PPS (explanatory variable) had both immediate and long-term effect on the rates of road traffic accident mortality (RTAMs) separately by gender. Subjects were classified by socioeconomic status (low and high) using two indicators: educational attainment (up to lower secondary education; upper secondary education or more) and occupation (manual and non-manual workers). We performed several segmented Poisson regression models, controlling for trend, seasonality, 2004 road safety measures and fuel consumption as proxy for traffic exposure. Among men, we found a decrease on the RTAMs immediately after PPS in those with low educational level (16.2 %, IC95 %: 6.1 %–25.2 %) and manual workers (16.3 %, IC95 %: 2.8 %–27.8 %), and a non-significant increase among those with high education level and non-manual workers (6.2 % and 1.8 %). Among women, there were no significant differences in the immediate effect of PPS by socioeconomic status. We did not identify significant trend changes between pre-PPS and post-PPS periods in any socioeconomic group. In a context of downward trend of traffic mortality, the PPS implementation led to an immediate reduction on death rates only among men with a low socioeconomic status.}

Trends reveal that derailments consistently account for more than 70 % of the U.S. railroad industry’s average annual accident cost. Hence, knowledge of explanatory factors that distinguish derailments from other accident types can inform more cost-effective and impactful railroad risk management strategies. Five feature scoring methods, including ANOVA and Gini, agreed that the top four explanatory factors in accident type prediction were track class, type of movement authority, excess speed, and territory signalization. Among 11 different types of machine learning algorithms, the extreme gradient boosting method was most effective at predicting the accident type with an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) metric of 89 %. Principle component analysis revealed that relative to other accident types, derailments were more strongly associated with lower track classes, non-signalized territories, and movement authorizations within restricted limits. On average, derailments occurred at 16 kph below the speed limit for the track class whereas other accident types occurred at 32 kph below the speed limit. Railroads can use the integrated data preparation, machine learning, and feature ranking framework presented to gain additional insights for managing risk, based on their unique operating environments.}

The Highway Safety Manual micro-level approach uses individual intersections and road segments as analysis units, and correspondingly identifies some isolated road entities as hotspots. However, because traffic police and administrative agencies routinely conduct safety improvement based on multiple continuous segments and intersections, the identification of hotspots at the micro-level is inefficient for field application. To better meet this need, this study proposes a new meso-level approach to identify hotspots, specifically on suburban arterials. Meso-level analysis units of three different configurations (201, 150, and 100 units) were obtained by combining a set number of intersections and their adjacent segments according to crash distribution and homogeneity. Their influence areas were determined according to the proportion of urbanized land in areas perpendicularly adjacent to the arterials. Three Bayesian Poisson-lognormal conditional autoregressive models (PLN-CAR) considering spatial correlations were developed for each unit configuration, using the full Bayesian (FB) method to ameliorate random fluctuation in crash counts. Potential for safety improvement (PSI) values were calculated based on the modeling results and were used to identify hotspots. Two measures, i.e., the concentrated degree of hotspots (CDH) and the hotspot identification accuracy (HIA), were proposed to make a quantitative and comparative evaluation. Results showed that 1) arterials with more parallel roads suffer lower crash risk, and 2) considering both the hotspot distribution and the identification accuracy, the 150 meso-level unit configuration was the best. The proposed meso-level hotspot identification method promises to be adaptive to safety improvement practices on suburban arterials.}

Drowsiness among the drivers can be detected using variety of modalities, including electroencephalogram (EEG), eye movement, and vehicle driving dynamics. Among these EEG is highly accurate but very intrusive and cumbersome. On the other hand, vehicle driving dynamics are very easy to acquire but accuracy is not very high. Eye movement based approach is very attractive in terms of balance between these two extremes. However, eye movement based techniques normally require an eye tracking device which consists of high speed camera with sophisticated algorithm to extract eye movement related parameters such as blinking, eye closure, saccades, fixation etc. This makes eye tracking based drowsiness detection difficult to implement as a practical system, especially on an embedded platform. In this paper, authors propose to use eye images from camera directly without the need for expensive eye-tracking system. Here, eye related movements are captured by Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to detect the drowsiness. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is a class of RNN which has several advantages over vanilla RNNs. In this work an array of LSTM cells are utilized to model the eye movements. Two types of LSTMs were employed: 1-D LSTM (R-LSTM) which is used as baseline and the convolutional LSTM (C-LSTM) which facilitates using 2-D images directly. Patches of size 48 × 48 around each eye were extracted from 38 subjects, participating in a simulated driving experiment. The state of vigilance among the subjects were independently assessed by power spectral analysis of multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, recorded simultaneously, and binary labels of alert and drowsy (baseline) were generated. Results show high efficacy of the proposed system. R-LSTM based approach resulted in accuracy around 82 % and C-LSTM based approach resulted in accuracy in the range of 95%–97%. Comparison is also provided with a recently published eye-tracking based approach, showing the proposed LSTM technique outperform with a wide margin.}

High-resolution modeling frameworks such as activity-based or trip-based approach could be pursued for evaluating planning level non-motorist demand. However, running a travel demand model system to generate demand inputs for non-motorized safety is cumbersome and resource intensive. The current study is focused on addressing this drawback by developing an integrated non-motorized demand and crash prediction framework for mobility and safety analysis. Towards this end, we propose a three-step framework to evaluate non-motorists safety: (1) develop aggregate level models for non-motorist generation and attraction at a zonal level, (2) develop non-motorists trip exposure matrices for safety evaluation and (3) develop aggregate level non-motorists crash frequency and severity proportion models. The framework is developed for the Central Florida region using non-motorist demand data from National Household Travel Survey (2009) Florida Add-on and non-motorist crash frequency and severity data from Florida. The applicability of the framework is illustrated through extensive policy scenario analysis.}

abstract = {Objectives
Research on the deterrent effects of driving-under-the-influence (DUI) laws has been limited in China, which has criminalized drunk driving since May 2011 yet the effectiveness of this legislation remains unclear. Primary studies are needed to confirm whether government reports of reductions in DUI rates since then can indeed match changes in driver perceptions of DUI risk, and if so, be attributed to what specific components of the DUI legal environments. Based on the classical theory of deterrence and recent advances in differential deterrence, this study adopted a conjoint experiment from a previous US study that simulated the decision-making process of potential drinking drivers, and evaluated how DUI sanctions and enforcement practices contributed differentially to the three components of deterrence (i.e., certainty, swiftness, and severity of punishment). Key individual characteristics and nonlegal factors, as suggested by differential deterrence research to moderate the impact of DUI laws, were also considered.
Methods
A Web-based conjoint experiment was conducted on a sample of 109 college students from two major universities in Shenzhen, China. Participants were randomly assigned to blocks of hypothetical scenarios composed of different levels of DUI enforcement and penalties, and asked to choose from a pair of scenarios each time, in which they were more likely to drink and drive. They also answered questions adapted from previous studies that measured key individual factors in relation to differential deterrence, such as informal sanction threat, moral inhibition, and personal and vicarious experiences with punishment. Such individual differences were accounted for in both a conventional two-level mixed logit aggregate model and a Hierarchical Bayes model.
Results
Consistent with prior findings in Western countries, DUI enforcement intensity, was found to be the strongest deterrent to potential drinking drivers in China. License suspension, as an administrative punishment that can be swiftly implemented, was also effective in deterring the Chinese drivers, who however were much more likely to fear the revocation of their licenses rather than a 6-month suspension only. Meanwhile, they were notably deterred by the possibility of being in jail for 1–3 days, let alone for 1–2 months. Altogether, enforcement, license suspension and jail penalties accounted for more than 75 percent of attribute impact on drivers’ decision to drink and drive, whereas fine penalty and license points had almost no effect. On the other hand, nonlegal factors such as informal sanction threat and vicarious experiences were found to have significantly moderated the deterrent effects of DUI laws.
Conclusions
Overall, this study quantified the unique effects of perceived certainty, swiftness, and severity of DUI punishment in the Chinese context, and supported the usefulness of conjoint experiments for examining risk perceptions and DUI decisions in different legal environments. It also provided new empirical evidence on differential deterrence and pointed out the need of determining for which subsets of individuals and under what conditions can legal sanctions successfully deter potential offenders. Such research will help researchers and policy makers better understand the role of deterrence, for more effective policy development related to DUI as well as other important traffic safety issues.}

abstract = {The use of Extreme Value Theory (EVT) models for traffic conflict-based crash estimation is becoming increasingly popular with considerable recent advances achieved. The latest advances include developing EVT models that combine several conflict indicators and the use of data from several sites to increase the sample size of conflict extremes. Nevertheless, one important issue while developing EVT models is accounting for the unobserved heterogeneity across different conflict observation sites and road user behaviours which can lead to biased and inefﬁcient parameter estimates and erroneous inferences. This study proposes a random parameters (RP) Bayesian hierarchical extreme value modeling approach to account for the unobserved heterogeneity. The proposed approach is applied to estimate rear-end crashes from traffic conflicts collected from four signalized intersections in the city of Surrey, British Columbia. Traffic conflicts were characterized by four indicators: time to collision (TTC), modified TTC (MTTC), post-encroachment time (PET), and deceleration rate to avoid a crash (DRAC). MTTC was used to fit the generalized extreme value distribution, while the other three conflict indicators were treated as covariates. Six covariates including TTC, PET, DRAC, traffic volume, shock wave area, and platoon ratio were considered to account for non-stationarity in conflict extremes. Several RP, random intercepts (RI), and fixed parameters (FP) Bayesian hierarchical univariate extreme value models were developed. The results indicate that the RP model outperforms both the RI model and the FP model in terms of crash estimation accuracy and precision. Such superiority may be due to the ability of the RP model to better account for the unobserved heterogeneity.}

The connected vehicle environment provides drivers with surrounding traffic information and improve their driving behavior by helping them make safe decisions efficiently. As such, this study is to examine the effects of the connected vehicle environment on driving behavior and safety at the tunnel entrance zone. To this end, this research simulates a connected vehicle environment and provides driving aids through the Human-Machine Interface (HMI). Secondly, 40 participants with diverse backgrounds drove the simulator under two different driving conditions: HMI-OFF (traditional driving environment) and HMI-ON (connected vehicle environment). Finally, indicators are selected from speed control, stability and urgency to analyze the impact of the connected vehicle environment on drivers’ behaviors and safety at the warning zone and tunnel entrance zone. The results show that in the connected vehicle environment, the drivers’ speed control in the warning zone is improved and their deceleration behavior is advanced. The driver's speed control and stability are improved while the danger level of the accident is reduced 100 m ahead of the tunnel entrance. Besides, the driver's speed control and stability have been both improved 300 m after the tunnel entrance. Overall, in the connected vehicle environment, the driver can recognize the tunnel in advance and adjust his driving speed in time to ensure his safety at the tunnel entrance. The results of this study play a critical role in the design and research of warning systems in a connected vehicle environment, and will also guide vehicle manufacturers in designing safety-related functions of automated vehicles. In this research, a connected vehicle environment test platform based on driving simulation technology is constructed and tested in specific tunnel entrance scenarios, which provides a reference for realizing active protection of vehicles at the tunnel entrance.}

The results can provide a reference to traffic managers for evaluating incident severities, thus take proper control measures after the incident in order not to underestimate or overestimate the negative impact. A two-phase scheme is proposed, including impacted region determination and speed reduction quantification. We first propose a Frame Region (FR) method, based on the shockwave propagation, to determine the spatiotemporal impacted region (SIR) using speed map. It is worth-noting that we design a statistical experiment to prove the rationality of congestion threshold selection. Secondly, we introduce a causal inference method for identifying the matched freeway segments. The traffic condition of finally matched freeway segments can be served as non-incident traffic condition of the incident occurred location, which contributes to quantifying the incident impact on speed reduction. We further demonstrate the proposed method in a case study by taking advantage of an incident record and related real freeway speed data in China. An interesting observation is that, along with the freeway segments away from the incident location, the congestion duration time of different freeway segments firstly rises and then decreases. The case study also illustrates the impact of incident on speed lasts almost 3 h and the congestion caused by the incident spreads 11 km, while the average causal effect of incident on all the impacted freeway segments is 42.3 km/h.}

The key aim of this study is to analyse simultaneously knowledge, attitudes, and behavior toward the use of mobile phones while driving in one of the largest and populous metropolitan areas of Italy, Naples. The data acquired from 774 questionnaires - administered to subjects evenly divided by gender and with an average age of 39 years - revealed that 69 % have used their mobile phone while driving at least once in their lifetime. Among those who used the phone, 63.6 % use it to make phone calls while 75.2 % only to answer them; 49.1 % read messages and only 33.3 % write them. It is also notable that 34.1 % do not stop to answer a call and only 10 % do not value the use of headsets while driving as fundamental. The results indicate that cell phone usage while driving is common in the study population, despite many having university-level education and satisfactory risks awareness. The multiple linear regression analysis shows how knowledge is not correlated to the behavior held. On the contrary, attitudes are strongly correlated to knowledge and behavior, meaning that good attitudes bring forth positive behavior. According to the collected data and statistical analysis, it is possible to identify factors that can greatly affect the use of mobile phone while driving and establish targeted prevention programs.}

The proposed approach is applied to rank road segments on Kaiyang Freeway in China, which is conducted via programming in the freeware WinBUGS. The results of Bayesian estimation and assessment indicate that incorporating spatio-temporal correlations and interactions into the crash frequency model significantly improves the overall goodness-of-fit performance and affects the identified crash-contributing factors and the estimated safety effects for each severity level. With respect to the ranking results, significant differences are found between those generated from the proposed approach and those generated from the naïve ranking approach and a Bayesian approach based on the multivariate Poisson-lognormal model. Besides, the ranks under the posterior mean criterion are found generally consistent with those under the posterior expected rank criterion.}

An increasing body of research suggests though that spatial and/or temporal dependencies (i.e., clusters or hot spots) among accidents likely exist. Along with understanding where and when such spatiotemporal dependencies may occur, another important facet to consider is the geographic extent or area associated with the hot spots. For example, an accident hot spot may involve a small, isolated portion of the transportation system or a much more expansive geographic area. Better delineation and quantification of the morphological characteristics of accident hotspots can provide valuable decision support for planning for accident hot spot mitigation and prevention. As the size and shape of accident hot spots may evolve over time, the capability to track such dynamics is vital, especially with respect to the identification of processes effecting hot spot occurrence as well as assessments of the efficacy of efforts to mitigate factors underlying hot spot development. To this end, a Geographical Information Systems (GIS) based framework is outlined to facilitate the analysis of the morphological characteristics of hot spots over time. The analysis framework is applied to a case study of vehicular accidents reported over a two-year period to demonstrate its practical utility. The application results indicate that patterns of change in hot spot morphology can be effectively quantified and a variety of informative spatial and temporal patterns can be detected.}

In reality, design of mountainous highways can be a challenging task due to complex geological and topographic conditions. From the safety perspective, it is also important that road geometric design defects and potential accident blind spots can be reasonably identified from the design. To this end, this study formulated an innovative Geographic Information System (GIS)-based geometric design quality assessment model for mountain highways. First, a fault tree analysis (FTA) was conducted to identify a series of highway design risk factors. Second, a decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) technique was employed to derive the factors’ weight and sensitivity. Third, road driving suitability, traffic safety sensitivity, design risk factors, and effective distance were taken into account to formulate a design quality assessment model. Forth, two case studies based on a mountainous highway located in southwest China were conducted to validate this model. The case studies established that improving geometric design quality can significantly improve the road traffic safety of mountainous highways. It is also revealed that the existence of steep slopes, tunnels, and rapid horizontal and vertical alignment change can considerably compromise the geometric design quality (GDQ), therefore, configuring these parameters is worth of further investigation. Last but not least, this study provides essential knowledge to the regime of accident prevention, high-risk road section location and mapping, traffic safety management, and design of smart transport systems.}

In conditionally automated vehicles, drivers may engage in non-driving-related tasks (NDRTs), which can negatively affect their situation awareness (SA) and preparedness to resume control of the vehicle, when necessary. Previous work has investigated engagement in NDRTs, but questions remain unanswered regarding its effect on drivers’ SA during a takeover event. The objective of the current study is to use eye-tracking to aid in understanding how visual engagement in NDRTs affects changes in SA of the driving environment after a takeover request (TOR) has been issued. Thirty participants rode in a simulated SAE Level 3 automated driving environment and engaged in three separate pre-TOR tasks (Surrogate Reference Task, Monitoring Task, and Peripheral Detection Task) until presented with a TOR. Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT) scores and gaze behavior were recorded during the post-TOR segment. Overall, longer times spent viewing the driving scene, and more dispersed visual attention allocation, were observed to be associated with better overall SA. Also, location-based eye tracking metrics show most promise in differentiating between task conditions with significantly different SAGAT scores. Findings from this work can inform the development of real-time SA assessment techniques using eye movements and ultimately contribute to improved operator roadway awareness for next-generation automated transportation.}

This paper highlights the influential factors on trajectory prediction system performance by (i) identifying driver behaviours impacting the trajectory prediction system; and (ii) analysing other contributing factors such as traffic density, secondary task, gender and age group. To explore the most influential contributing factors, we first train an interaction-aware trajectory prediction system using time-series data derived from the Second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP2) Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS). Prediction error is then analysed based on driver characteristics such as driver profile which is subjectively measured through self-reported questions, and driving performance which is based on evaluation of time-series information such as speed, acceleration, jerk, time, and space headway. The results show that prediction error significantly increased in the scenarios where the driver engaged in risky behaviour. Analysis shows that trajectory prediction system performance is also affected by factors such as traffic density, engagement in secondary tasks, driver gender and age group. We show that the driver profile, which is subjectively measured using self-reported questionnaires, is not as significant as the driving performance information, which is objectively measured and extracted during each specific driving scenario.}

During the test in the simulator, oculomotor activity was recorded. Drivers’ personality traits were determined using the EPQ-R questionnaire. With the increase of cognitive load in drivers with high levels of neuroticism and extraversion, the time of saccades and fixation significantly increased. The decrease in the effectiveness of visual attention shifting in older drivers intensified as the difficulty of performing tasks increased and manifested itself in longer saccade and fixation times. A higher level of neuroticism and the resulting stress and emotional tension can translate into a greater tendency to make mistakes in older drivers.}

The anticipated introduction of Autonomous Driven vehicles could allow “drivers” to adopt similar postures and being involved in the same activities as passengers, allowing them a similar set of non-nominal postures. Therefore, the need to investigate the effects of non-nominal occupant sitting postures during relevant car crash events is becoming increasingly important. This study aims to investigate the effect of different postures of passengers in the front seat of a car on kinematic and kinetic responses during intersection crashes. A Human Body Model (HBM) was positioned in a numerical model of the front passenger seat of a midsize Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) in a total of 35 postures, including variations to the lower and upper extremities, torso, and head postures. Three crash configurations, representative of predicted urban intersection crashes, were assessed in a simulation study; two side impacts, a near-side and a far-side, respectively, and a frontal impact. The occupant kinematics and internal loads were analyzed, and any deviation between the nominal and altered posture responses were quantified using cross-correlation of signals to highlight the most notable variations. Posture changes to the lower extremities had the largest overall influence on the lower extremities, pelvis, and whole-body responses for all crash configurations. In the frontal impact, crossing the legs allowed for the highest pelvis excursions and rotations, which affected the whole-body response the most. In the two side-impacts, leaning the torso in the coronal plane affected the torso and head kinematics by changing the interaction with the vehicle’s interior. Additionally, in far-side impacts supporting the upper extremity on the center console resulted in increased torso excursions. Moreover, the response of the upper extremities was consistently sensitive to posture variations of all body regions.}

It aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic review of significant SSM studies, identify limitations and opportunities for future SSM and CAV research, and assist researchers and practitioners with choosing the most appropriate SSM for safety studies. The behaviors of CAV can be very different from those of Human-Driven Vehicles (HDV). Even among CAV with different automation/connectivity levels, their behaviors are likely to differ. Also, the behaviors of HDV can change in response to the existence of CAV in mixed autonomy traffic. Simulation by far is the most viable solution to model CAV safety. However, it is questionable whether conventional SSM can be applied to modeling CAV safety based on simulation results due to the lack of sophisticated simulation tools that can accurately model CAV behaviors and SSM that can take CAV’s powerful sensing and path prediction and planning capabilities into crash risk modeling, although some researchers suggested that proper simulation model calibration can be helpful to address these issues. A number of critical questions related to SSM for CAV safety research are also identified and discussed, including SSM for CAV trajectory optimization, SSM for individual vehicles and vehicle platoon, and CAV as a new data source for developing SSM.}

They thereby can be viewed as aggressive speeders whose behaviors may result in more hazards than others. Among the factors contributing to taxi speeding, the operational factors are proven to be deterministic. However, previous studies mainly investigate the operational factors of taxi speeding frequency, which fail to comprehensively unveil the impact of factors on speeders, especially for aggressive speeders. This study intends to disclose the operational factors affecting the aggressive taxi speeders with the random parameters Bayesian least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) modeling approach. Taxi speeding behaviors and several operational factors are extracted from taxi GPS trajectory data in Chengdu, China. Based on the hourly speeding frequency and average speeding severity of each speeder, the fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm is employed to categorize taxi speeders into three cohorts: restrained speeder (RS), moderate speeder (MS), and belligerent speeder (BS). Compared to RS, MS and BS are treated as the aggressive taxi speeders. Several binary logistic models are developed with RS as the reference category. The random parameters Bayesian binary logistic LASSO model that captures the unobserved heterogeneity and tackles the multicollinearity is found to be the best fit model to identify the significant operational factors. The results indicate that aggressive taxi speeders are linked to longer daily driving distance and cruise distance, shorter delivery time, higher hourly income, driving at night, and driving on low-speed limit roads. However, intensive lane-changes and sufficient daily naps do not contribute to aggressive taxi speeders. Moreover, BS is more sensitive to the operational factors than MS. This study stresses the necessity of implementing speeder classification in taxi driver management and conceiving countermeasures considering the operational factors which are significantly associated with the aggressive taxi speeders.}

Driving simulator technology was used to reproduce the experimental environment and obtain driver behavior data. Four indicators-speed, standard deviation of speed, absolute values of acceleration, and depth of accelerator-were selected to examine the main and interactive effects of NPT, NPM, and their combination based on repeated measures analysis of variance. The results show that the driver’s psychological state and operation of the vehicle on the urban expressway were affected by the prompt timing and messages of the audio navigation system. An interaction effect existed between prompt timing and prompt messages of the system, and this effect adjusted the effect on the driver’s psychological state and vehicle operation caused by these two important factors.

abstract = {Safety Performance Functions (SPFs) are critical tools in the management of highway safety projects. SPFs are used to predict the average number of crashes per year at a location, such as a road segment or an intersection. The Highway Safety Manual (HSM) provides default safety performance functions (SPFs), but it is recommended that states in the U.S. develop jurisdiction-specific SPFs using local crash data. To do this for the state of Tennessee, crash and road inventory data were integrated for multi-lane rural highway segments for the years 2013−2017. In addition to developing SPFs similar to those contained in the HSM, this study applied a new methodology to capture variation in crashes in both space and time. Specifically, Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression (GTWR) models for the localization of SPFs were developed. The new methodology incorporates temporal aspects of crashes in the models because the impact of a specific variable on crash frequency may vary over time due to several reasons. Results indicate that GTWR models remarkably outperform the traditional regression models by capturing spatio-temporal heterogeneity. Most parameter estimates were found to vary substantially across space and time. In other words, the association of contributing variables with the number of crashes can vary from one region or period of time to another. This finding weakens the idea of transferring default SPFs to other states and applying a single localized SPF to all regions of a state. Enabled by growing computational power, these results emphasize the importance of accounting for spatial and temporal heterogeneity and developing highly localized SPFs. The methodology of this study can be used by researchers to follow the temporal trend and location of critical factors to identify sites for safety improvements.}

abstract = {Introduction
Many novice drivers listen to music while driving, but the effect of music-listening on novice driver’s safety is uncertain. We explored how music tempo affects two key aspects of novice drivers' cognitive functioning, mental load and hazard perception.
Method
In a within-subjects experimental design study, 37 novice drivers completed a hazard perception test in simulated traffic situations under four randomly-ordered conditions: while listening to fast, medium, slow tempo music, and without listening to any music. Mental load was recorded both subjectively and through psychophysiological measures during all conditions.
Results
When listening to fast-tempo music, novice drivers’ subjective load value, heart rate and respiratory rate were significantly higher than that during the other two music tempo conditions and the no music condition. Skin temperature was significantly higher during fast-tempo music than during the slow music tempo and no music conditions. When listening to slow-tempo music, drivers’ R-R interval (variability in heart rate, with longer intervals reflecting lower mental load) was significantly longer than while listening to fast and mid-tempo music, and their hazard perception scores were significantly higher than the other three conditions.
Conclusions
Listening to fast tempo music was associated with increased mental load and reduced hazard perception ability in traffic among novice drivers. Listening to slow tempo music did not increase novice drivers’ mental load and offered some benefit to their hazard perception.}

This study utilizes a near-crash dataset extracted from a naturalistic driving study to explore the patterns of near-crash events with or without the involvement of secondary tasks as a surrogate approach to understand the impact of these behaviors on traffic safety. The dataset contains information about driver behaviors, such as secondary tasks, vehicle maneuvers, other conflict vehicles’ maneuvers before and during near-crash events, and the driving environment. The patterns for near-crashes with or without the involvement of secondary tasks are mined by adopting the apriori association rule algorithm. Finally, the mined rules for the near-crash events with or without the involvement of the secondary tasks are analyzed and compared. The results demonstrate that near-crashes with the involvement of secondary tasks often occur with drivers in a relatively stable and presumably predictable environment, such as an interstate highway with a constant speed. This type of near-crash is highly associated with the leading vehicle’s sudden slowing or stopping since there is no expectation of any interruptions for these drivers performing the secondary tasks. The most common evasive maneuver in this kind of emergency is braking. Near-crashes without the involvement of secondary tasks is often associated with lane-changing behavior and sideswipe incidents. With shorter reaction time and awareness of the driving environment, the drivers in this type of near-crash can often make more complex maneuvers, like braking and steering, to avoid a collision. Understanding the patterns of these two types of near-crash incidents could help safety researchers, traffic engineers, and even vehicle designers/engineers develop countermeasures for minimizing potential collisions caused by secondary tasks or improper lane changing behaviors.}

The adopted approach involved automating the segment characteristic extraction process for the urban network study area. Subsequently, naturalistic driving big data from an innovative smartphone application were map-matched to the segments that each driver traversed, and thus geometrical, road network and driver behavior spatial data frames were obtained per road segment. Global and local Moran's I coefficients were calculated based on a nearest-neighbour scheme, and indicated the presence of a certain degree of positive spatial autocorrelation both for harsh brakings (HBs) and for harsh accelerations (HAs). Furthermore, the creation of empirical and theoretical spherical variograms indicated that on average, about 190 m from each road segment centroid there is no observable spatial autocorrelation for HBs; the respective distance is 200 m for HAs. Geographically Weighted Poisson Regression (GWPR) models were used to model harsh event frequencies. Segment length and pass count are positively correlated with HB frequencies, while gradient and neighbourhood complexity are negatively correlated with HB frequencies. Curvature, segment length, pass count and the presence of traffic lights are positively correlated with HA frequencies. Road type and lane number were found to have a more circumstantial effect overall.}

A Structural Equation Model (SEM), similar to a previous study, conducted in Beijing, was developed for the frequency of calling and texting during driving with perceived risk of calling and texting, perceived importance and emotionality as predictors. The frequency of different conversations shows that perceived importance of the call mainly influences the driver’s choice to make a call during driving in Lahore.

Crossing over non-designed places is a main cause of traffic crashes among pedestrians. This study aimed to investigate how perceptions about walking facilities and risk-taking affect pedestrians’ crossing behaviour. A stated preference questionnaire was designed and a random sample of 390 pedestrians were interviewed face-to-face in two regions of Tehran with three options for pedestrians to cross (overpass, zebra crossing, and non-designed places (NDP)). Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) resulted in three latent dimensions: risk-taking/conformity, pedestrians’ perception of overpass, and NDP. Then, data were classified based on latent variables using K-means cluster analysis. Clustering resulted in four groups: group 1 (Cautious; negative perception of overpasses; positive perception of NDP), group 2 (Cautious; negative perception of overpasses; negative perception of NDP), group 3 (Cautious; positive perception of overpasses; negative perception of NDP), and group 4 (Risk-taker; negative perception of overpasses; negative perception of NDP). Finally, a Multinomial Logit Model (MNL) was developed for four groups of pedestrians. The results show that pedestrians’ behaviour differentiate based on latent variables. It was found that being accompanied by a child increases the probability of using an overpass even for pedestrians in group 4 with high risk-taking propensity, but it was more important for pedestrians in group 3 who held positive perceptions of overpasses and negative perceptions of NDP. Also, during congestion, group 4 was more inclined to cross at NDP. It was concluded that in the first group, unsafe choices among student respondents could be associated with their facility perceptions rather than their risk-taking/conformity. Results of this study can be helpful in selecting more appropriate locations for overpasses and crosswalks installation based on pedestrians’ behaviour.}

In this study, we attempted to explain drivers’ takeover performance variation in a level 3 automated vehicle in consideration of the effects of trust, system characteristics, environmental characteristics, and driver characteristics with a structural equation model. The model was built by incorporating drivers’ takeover time and quality as endogenous variables. A theoretical framework of the model was hypothesized on the basis of the ACT-R cognitive architecture and relevant research results. The validity of the model was confirmed using data collected from 136 driving simulator samples under the condition of voluntary non-driving-related tasks. Results revealed that takeover time budget was the most critical factor in promoting the safety and stability of takeover process, which, together with traffic density, drivers’ age and manual driving experience, determined drivers’ takeover quality directly. In addition, the pre-existing experience with an automated system or a similar technology and self-confidence of the driver, as well as takeover time budget, strongly influenced the takeover time directly. Apart from the direct effects mentioned above, trust, as an intermediary variable, explained a major portion of the variance in takeover time. Theoretically, these findings suggest that takeover behavior could be comprehensively evaluated from the two dimensions of takeover time and quality through the combination of trust, driver characteristics, environmental characteristics, and vehicle characteristics. The influence mechanism of the above factors is complex and multidimensional. In addition to the form of direct influence, trust, as an intermediary variable, could reflect the internal mechanism of the takeover behavior variation. Practically, the findings emphasize the crucial role of trust in the change in takeover behavior through the dimensions of subjective trust level and monitoring strategy, which may provide new insights into the function design of takeover process.}

abstract = {Background
Older adults constitute the group most vulnerable to COVID-19 mortality. As a result, in North America and elsewhere, older adults have been strongly advised to shelter in place. Older adults also represent the fastest growing segment of licensed drivers.
Objective
We examined the change in injuries and fatalities sustained by younger and older drivers and pedestrians during the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that adults ages 80 years and over would have a proportionally larger reduction than the other drivers and pedestrians.
Methods
Using a cohort design, we compared the proportion of drivers and pedestrians involved in injuries and fatalities attributable to individuals aged 80 years and over, as recorded in the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (Canada) database, between the 30 days prior to shelter-in-place related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent 30 days. By way of comparison, we conducted a similar comparison for younger age cohorts (16−24 years, 25−34 years, 35−54 years, 55−64 years, and 65−79 years).
Results
Drivers aged 80 years and over represented 21 per 1000 injuries and fatalities in the 30 days prior to March 17, 2020 (95 % CI: 15−29), and 8 per 1000 injuries and fatalities in the 30 days beginning on that date (95 % CI: 2−20), a 64.7 % reduction (exp (β) post 0.353, 95 % CI 0.105−0.892). Drivers in the 35−54 year age range underwent a significant but smaller reduction of 22.9 %; no significant changes were seen for drivers in other age groups, or for pedestrians of any age.
Conclusions and relevance
The physical distancing measures that aimed to reduce the spread of COVID-19 resulted in a marked reduction in driver injuries and fatalities in the oldest old, illustrating the impact of physical distancing recommendations in this population. The excess mortality burden faced by the oldest adults during the COVID-19 pandemic, by direct exposure to the virus, may be indirectly mitigated by the reduction in road-related deaths in this cohort.}

The SPFs in the HSM specify expected annual crash frequencies as a function of various roadway and roadside features, with the most important predictor variable being traffic volume, which serves as a measure of vehicle exposure to crashes. Traffic volumes are typically measured using the average annual daily traffic and are incorporated into the SPFs using a natural logarithm transformation. This specification suggests that the relationship between expected crash frequency and traffic volume increases non-linearly with a constant elasticity over the range of observed values. While researchers concur that the relationship between expected crash frequencies and traffic volume is non-linear, further exploration of the functional form of this relationship may offer additional insights concerning the association between safety performance and vehicle exposure. This paper proposes an alternative functional form for the traffic volume variable in SPFs that allows for different elasticities between traffic volume and expected crash frequency within different traffic volume ranges, while preserving the same general non-linear relationship in existing HSM SPFs. Although other forms—like the Hoerl function—have been proposed in the literature, the proposed model allows for natural breakpoints in the traffic volume for which roadway or geometric features might have varying effects on low- or high-volume roads. The proposed functional form was applied to SPFs developed for two-lane rural roadways in Pennsylvania. Comparisons with SPFs developed using the traditional and Hoerl functional forms suggest that this proposed functional form offers an improved fit and predictive performance, and thus might be considered for the development of future SPFs.}

In the first experiment, conducted on a driving simulator, car drivers turned left in front of cars and motorcycles approaching an intersection under nighttime lighting conditions. The motorcycles were equipped with either a standard white central light, or one of three vertical configurations of white and yellow lights. The results showed that the standard configuration led to significantly more unsafe accepted gaps than the vertical configurations. In the second experiment, conducted on a test track using a similar task, the most promising motorcycle headlight configuration, i.e., the vertical yellow-white light arrangement (one central white light, plus one yellow light on the helmet and two yellow lights on the fork) was evaluated and compared to a standard configuration and a car. The vertical yellow-white headlight configuration again provided significant safety benefits as compared to the standard configuration. These findings demonstrate that motorcycle safety can be improved by headlight ergonomics that accentuate the vertical dimension of motorcycles. They also suggest that the driving simulator is a valid tool for conducting research on motorcycle headlight design.}

While the operational benefits of ramp metering have extensively been quantified, research on its safety effects is sparse. This study focused on evaluating the effects of ramp metering on the safety performance of the freeway mainline. It developed a crash risk prediction model for segments downstream of the entrance ramps when ramp metering is activated. The study was based on a corridor with system-wide ramp metering along I-95 in Miami, Florida. Real-time traffic, crash, and ramp metering operations data collected from 2016 to 2018 were used in the analysis. The study adopted a matched crash and non-crash case approach to evaluate the crash risk when ramp meters were activated and deactivated. A penalized logistic regression model was developed using a bootstrap resampling technique to estimate the effects of ramp metering activation and select important variables that could predict crash risk when ramp meters were activated. Results indicated that ramp metering improves safety along the freeway corridor by reducing the crash risk downstream of the entrance ramps. During ramp metering activation, the crash risk on segments downstream of the entrance ramps 5 min later can be predicted using the difference in the average lane speeds between upstream and downstream detectors, the average traffic volume in the lanes at the downstream and upstream detectors, and the coefficient of variation of speed between lanes in the upstream detectors. Also, the coefficient of variation of occupancy downstream could predict the crash risk 15 min later. The study results could be used by transportation agencies when evaluating the deployment of ramp meters. Moreover, the developed crash risk prediction model could be used in real-time to help agencies identify the increased crash risk and provide appropriate warning information to the upstream traffic.}

Pedestrians are involved in around one-third of the whole fatalities coming from the road traffic crashes in the state of Qatar. In areas with uncontrolled midblock crosswalks, it is very crucial to improve drivers’ alertness and yielding behavior. The objective of this driving simulator study is to investigate the impact of pedestrian detection strategies and pavement markings on driving behavior at high-speed uncontrolled crosswalks. To this end, an untreated condition (i.e. Control) was compared with three treatment conditions. The three treated conditions included two detection strategies, i.e., advance variable message sign (VMS) and LED lights, and road markings with pedestrian encircled. Each condition was tested with a yield/stop controlled marked crosswalk for two situations, i.e. with vs. without a pedestrian present. The experiment was conducted using the driving simulator at Qatar University. In total, 67 volunteers possessing a valid Qatari driving license participated in the study. Different analyses were conducted on vehicle-pedestrian interactions, driving speed, variations in acceleration/deceleration and lateral position. The results showed that both the LED and VMS conditions were helpful in increasing yielding rates up to 98.4 % and reducing the vehicle-pedestrian conflicts significantly. Furthermore, both treatments were effective in motivating drivers to reduce vehicle speed in advance. Considering the findings of this study, we recommend LED and VMS conditions as potentially effective solutions to improve safety at yield/stop controlled crosswalks.}

abstract = {Advancements in data collection and processing methods have produced large databases containing high quality vehicular data. Despite this, conventional vehicle-vehicle collisions remain difficult to identify due to their rarity. Therefore, there is a need to identify potential collisions given the introduction of these new data collection methods. Surrogate indicators are a popular methods utilised to identify such events, however, the type of surrogate that can be used depends heavily on the type of data collection method. Though most surrogate indicators are used at different road geometries, there is evidence to suggest that some surrogate indicators may perform better than others at a given geometry. This review provides two key contributions to the body of literature. Firstly, a review of kinematic surrogates is put forward, along with a discussion on the whether these surrogates can be contextualised at different road geometries. Secondly, an extensive analysis and discussion of observer-based and video processed surrogate indicators, the collision types they aim to identify and the geometries they have been used at previously were analysed and advantages and disadvantages of the surrogates have been presented for future use. To do this, intersections, highways and roundabouts were selected and divided into geometry subtypes (i.e. three-legged and four-legged intersection) and segments (i.e. approaches to intersections and internal to the intersection) based on the likelihood of crash types and pre-crash manoeuvres occurring in that segment. Due to the lack of research around the use of kinematic triggers at road geometries, it is difficult to advocate for the use of any given trigger over another at a given geometry. Furthermore, it was found that kinematic triggers cannot accurately identify conflicts from naturalistic driving data and require the use of advanced statistical techniques such as machine learning to increase accuracy. A brief analysis of threshold identification techniques was also performed. Several future works have been put forward including the introduction of surrogates which capture conflict severity and the role of surrogate indicators in connected and automated vehicle environments.}

Traffic phases were identified based on traffic flow variables and their correlations. Two advanced crash risk indexes from vehicle trajectories were conducted to evaluate the safety performance in each traffic state. The effects of various traffic flow variables (i.e. flow rate, density, average speed) on crash risks were explored based on speed-density plane, speed-flow plane and flow-density plane. Three regression models were developed to quantify the effects of traffic flow variables and traffic states on crash risks. The results show significant disparities of safety performance among different traffic states. Synchronized flow and wide moving jam are found to be the most dangerous phases. High density and low speed are associated with high crash risk. The best crash risk prediction performance is achieved when integrating both traffic phases and traffic parameters.}

abstract = {In this paper we determine the burden on society of fatalities resulting from road traffic injuries (RTIs) in South Africa. We express the burden in terms of reduced life expectancy and years of potential life lost (YPLL). Our main data source is the Injury Mortality Survey (IMS), a retrospective descriptive study carried out in South Africa. Using the mortality rates by sex and age from the IMS we calculate actual life expectancy at birth. In our counterfactual analysis we assume a 15 % reduction in road fatalities per year over a period of 10 years. A comparison of the estimated actual and counterfactual life expectancies suggests that the average gain in life expectancy at birth would be 0.58 years. Since the overwhelming majority of road traffic fatalities are male (75.7 %), there is a considerable gender difference. Men would gain on average 0.85 years while women would gain 0.30 years in life expectancy, closing the gender gap in life expectancy by about 14 %. We then discuss how a reduction in RTIs could be achieved. South Africa’s legislation addresses several of the important aspects of road safety (e.g. seat belt use, drink driving restrictions, speed limits, infrastructure improvements), however, enforcement is relatively weak and should be improved. There are a raft of measures that have been well researched in other countries, most interventions aim to modify the behaviour of road users and have been found to be cost effective. In addition to stricter enforcement, evidence from social science suggests that compliance could be increased through a change in social norms regarding road usage.}

The present study aims to examine the influence of a comprehensive range of Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) levels (0%, 0.03 %, 0.05 % and 0.08 %) on brake transition times of drivers. As young drivers show significantly higher crash risks compared to the experienced drivers, fifty-four young Indian drivers in the age group of 21–25 years (forty males and fourteen females) participated in the driving simulator experiments. The study adopted the framework of a within-subjects design, where each driver encountered rural and urban driving scenarios in a counterbalanced order, during experimental driving at each of the four BAC levels. Their brake transition times were estimated with respect to sudden pedestrian crossing events. Weibull Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) models with shared frailty were developed for quantifying the effects of BAC levels along with driver attributes on brake transition time. Preliminary analysis showed significant main effects of BAC (p < 0.001) and driving environment (p = 0.002) on brake transition time; however, their interaction effect was not significant (p = 0.485). The models revealed that 0.03 %, 0.05 % and 0.08 % BACs significantly reduced the brake transition times by 16 %, 28 % and 52 % in rural driving environment, and by 23 %, 37 % and 53 % in urban driving environment, compared to 0% BAC. The study outcomes may find application in assisting collision warning systems which take into account the braking behaviour of drivers.}

abstract = {Based on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and Internet of Vehicles (IoV), collision warning systems can provide drivers specific warning information such as the position of hazardous vehicles. However, positioning technologies vary in accuracy. Highly accurate positioning technologies are theoretically favorable for driving safety but are relatively difficult to use widely due to the high cost. While many researchers compared accuracies of different positioning technologies or explored methods to improve accuracy, few directly investigated the effect of different positioning accuracies for hazardous vehicles on driving safety. The present study conducted a laboratory experiment to explore the effect of four positioning accuracies of hazardous vehicles (i.e., highest: 1.5 m, high: 5 m, medium: 8.5 m, and low: 20 m, each value represented the radius of a circle and the estimated positions of hazardous vehicle were within this circle) and different traffic densities (high: one car per 150 m and low: one car per 1500 m) on driver behaviors. Thirty participants were distributed into high and low traffic density groups. Each participant received auditory warning information, which provided positions of hazardous vehicles relative to the ego vehicle concerning four accuracy levels. Driving safety (i.e., number of collisions and min TTC), driving performance (i.e., brake onset reaction time, steer onset reaction time, and mean deceleration), and subjective workload for warnings with different positioning accuracies of hazardous vehicles were recorded and analyzed. Results suggested the following: 1) Under low traffic density, four positioning accuracies showed no significant differences on driving safety and performance as well as subjective workload. 2) Under high traffic density, the medium positioning accuracy (8.5 m) exerted no significant differences on driving safety and performance compared with the highest positioning accuracy (1.5 m), which had the fastest brake onset reaction time, the least number of collisions, and the largest mean deceleration. Moreover, when traffic density was high, warnings with the highest (1.5 m), high (5 m), and medium (8.5 m) positioning accuracies generated a significantly lower workload than the warning with low (20 m) positioning accuracy. In conclusion, low positioning accuracy (20 m), which was a general accuracy of A-GNSS (no added cost) or GNSS (SPP) (relatively low cost) in dense urban area, was feasible for providing warnings under low traffic density. Medium positioning accuracy (8.5 m), which was the accuracy of A-GNSS (no added cost) in open-sky area, was acceptable for supporting warning systems under high traffic density. These findings have implications for promoting the application of positioning technologies to realize warnings in the near future.}

In this study, we harness highly detailed pre-crash Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) data 1) to understand errors and violations in crash, near-crash, and baseline (no event) driving situations, and 2) to explore pathways that lead to crashes in diverse built environments by applying rigorous modeling techniques. The “locality” factor in the NDS data provides information on various types of roadway and environmental surroundings that could influence traffic flow when a precipitating event is observed. Coded by the data reductionists, this variable is used to quantify the associations of diverse environments with crash outcomes both directly and indirectly through mediating driving errors and violations. While the most prevalent errors in crashes were recognition errors such as failing to recognize a situation (39 %) and decision errors such as not braking to avoid a hazard (34 %), performance errors such as poor lateral or longitudinal control or weak judgement (8 %) were most strongly correlated with crash occurrence. Path analysis uncovered direct and indirect relationships between key built-environment factors, errors and violations, and crash propensity. Possibly due to their complexity for drivers, urban environments are associated with higher chances of crashes (by 6.44 %). They can also induce more recognition errors which correlate with an even higher chances of crashes (by 2.16 % with the “total effect” amounting to 8.60 %). Similar statistically significant mediating contributions of recognition errors and decision errors near school zones, business or industrial areas, and moderate residential areas were also observed. From practical applications standpoint, multiple vehicle technologies (e.g., collision warning systems, cruise control, and lane tracking system) and built-environment (roadway) changes have the potential to reduce driving errors and violations which are discussed in the paper.}

abstract = {Road accidents are globally accepted challenges. They are one of the significant causes of deaths and injuries besides other direct and indirect losses. Countries and international organizations have designed technologies, systems, and policies to prevent accidents. However, hit-and-run accidents remain one of the most dangerous types of road accidents as the information about the vehicle responsible for the accident remain unknown. Therefore, any mechanism which can provide information about the impacting vehicle in hit-and-run accidents will be useful in planning and executing preventive measures to address this road menace. Since there exist several models to predict the impacting unknown vehicle, it becomes important to find which is the most accurate amongst those available. This research applies a process-based approach that identifies the most accurate model out of six supervised learning classification models viz. Logistic Reasoning, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Naïve Bayes, Classification and Regression Trees, k-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machine. These models are implemented using five-fold and ten-fold cross validation, on road accident data collected from five mid-sized Indian cities: Agra, Amritsar, Bhopal, Ludhiana, and Vizag (Vishakhapatnam).This study investigates the possible input factors that may have effect on the performance of applied models. Based on the results of the experiment conducted in this study, Support Vector Machine has been found to have the maximum potentiality to predict unknown impacting vehicle type in hit-and-run accidents for all the cities except Amritsar. The result indicates that, Classification and Regression Trees have maximum accuracy, for Amritsar. Naïve Bayes performed very poorly for the five cities. These recommendations will help in predicting unknown impacting vehicles in hit-and-run accidents. The outcome is useful for transportation authorities and policymakers to implement effective road safety measures for the safety of road users.}

Freeway tunnel hits are a constant threat in South Korea due to its mostly mountainous terrain. Despite efforts by public agencies to include disaster remedial or preventative facilities in the development of freeway tunnels, these facilities are designed mainly to reduce the number of collisions instead of also mitigate the consequences of a crash. Hence, the Korea Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (KMOLIT) recently presented a plan to modify the list of risk factors affecting tunnel traffic safety, and it recommended several strategies for tunnel traffic safety management. The study presented here took a data-driven approach to quantitatively confirming the strategies recommended by KMOLIT through the random forest-based binomial regression. The following factors were found to be significantly associated with serious injury crashes involving freeway tunnel strikes: adverse weather, fatigued and distracted drivers, collision type (i.e., head-on/angle/rear-end), tunnel exit, tunnel width, curve radius (radius less than 1800 m), and heavy vehicle. This study compares specifications of each government strategy with the effects of the identified risk factors on injuries involved in tunnel crashes to quantitatively support recommendations to modify the government strategies.}

This article uses data from the Los Angeles region in 2010–2019 to explore the relationships between the built environment factors and the spatial distribution of freight truck-related crashes using XGBoost and SHAP methods. Results from the XGBoost model show that variables related to the built environment, in particular demographics, land uses and road network, are highly correlated to freight truck related crashes of all three injury types. The SHAP value plots further indicate the important nonlinear relationships between independent variables and dependent variables. This study also emphasizes the differences in modeling mechanisms between the XGBoost model and traditional statistical models. The findings will help transport planners develop operational measures for resolving the emerging freight truck related traffic safety problems in local communities.}

Pedestrians, conventional bicycles, and electric bicycles (e-bikes) currently coexist in many shared spaces, with the prevalence of e-bikes increasing gradually in recent years. Shared spaces can provide a lower-stress experience for users because they are separated from motorized traffic, but frequent interactions among users raise safety concerns. This study sought to investigate conflict behaviours and characteristics among pedestrians, conventional bicycles, and e-bikes in shared spaces. Video data covering 12 h from three locations in Shenzhen city was analyzed. A total of 1748 pedestrians, 1748 conventional bicycles, and 930 e-bikes were observed, while 337 traffic conflicts were identified using the Dutch Objective Conflict Technique for Operation and Research (DOCTOR) method. Shared-space crash data recorded between April of 2013 and September of 2019 was used to validate and complement the conflict analysis. Friedman test was used to compare the conflict behaviours and characteristics among different groups. The analysis showed a positive relationship between the traffic volume and the number of conflicts but an inverse relationship between the traffic ratios and conflict ratios. Evasive actions, including swerving, decelerating, accelerating, and their combinations, were analyzed for various conflict types and severities, with swerving found to be the most common, especially in slight conflicts. Compared with slight conflicts, conventional bicycles and e-bikes exhibited low-speed characteristics in serious conflicts. These results indicated that high traffic volume and traffic complexity are the main factors that affect conflicts. It was proposed that the conflict coefficient be used to measure shared-space safety. In addition, the video observation study and crash data analysis suggested that conflicts and crashes between e-bikes and pedestrians are high-occurrence events, and that pedestrians are often exposed to higher injury risks.}

However, class imbalance problem exists as the number of hit-and-run crashes is much smaller than that of non-hit-and-run crashes. The missing label problem also exists in the crash analysis due to reasons like data barrier such that the information hidden in the unlabelled samples has not been effectively utilised. In this paper, a cost-sensitive semi-supervised logistic regression (CS3LR) model is proposed for hit-and-run analysis, in order to tackle class-imbalanced data distribution and missing label problem, based on the crash dataset of Victorian, Australia (2013–2019). By performing label estimation with logistic regression jointly utilising both labelled and unlabelled data with pseudo labels in a well-designed cost-sensitive semi-supervised maximum likelihood framework, the proposed model can obtain an unbiased likelihood parameter for hit-and-run prediction and analysis. Comparing the experimental results of CS3LR model with two logistic regression models and seven machine learning methods, better performance of CS3LR model is demonstrated. The most significant contributing factors to hit-and-run crashes extracted by CS3LR with only 10% labelled data show a high degree of consistency with the true contributing factors obtained by the supervised cost-sensitive logistic regression with complete hit-and-run labels. The effects of class-weighted ratio and hyper-parameter λ on the performance of hit-and-run crash prediction model have also been analysed. The results can further provide recommendations and implications on the policies and counter-measures for preventing hit-and-run collisions and crimes. The methodology proposed in this paper can also be employed to analyse crash data with other types of missing labels, such as crash severity.}

However, their high travel speed may increase crash and injury risk. Due to their recent introduction accurate crash data are not available yet. Since near-crashes may serve as a proxy for crashes this study analyzed traffic conflicts (i.e., near-crashes and minor crashes) in the Netherlands with the aim to proactively identify potential crash partners, crash patterns, and crash risk increasing factors. To this end, twenty-eight participants used a speed-pedelec in daily traffic, equipped with a forward and a backward facing camera, for two to three consecutive weeks. In a total of 227 h of video footage in which a distance of 6584 km was travelled, 115 conflicts were identified of which 114 were near-crashes in which evasive actions were performed to avert a crash, and one was a minor crash. The most frequent conflict partner were bicycles (51 %), followed successively by cars and vans (28 %), pedestrians (12 %), powered two-wheelers (5 %) and animals (3 %). One conflict was with a truck. With conventional bicycles, most conflicts occurred in crossing maneuvers (36 %) and when the speed-pedelec and bicycle were travelling in the same direction (36 %). Also, with cars and vans, most conflicts occurred in crossing maneuvers (63 %). The case-cohort analyses in which characteristics in conflicts and characteristics in randomly selected moments of the same participant were identified, showed conflict risks to be high if: (1) bicycles or cars were in the proximity of the speed-pedelec but was substantially higher for bicycles than for cars (OR = 43.28, 95 % CI = [16.85−111.17] and OR = 22.43, 95 % CI = [7.59−66.28] respectively), (2) speed-pedelecs overtook other road users which were mostly bicycles (OR = 17.25, 95 % CI = [7.58−39.24]), (3) the speed-pedelecs travelled on bicycle facilities (both legally or illegally) (OR = 1.81, 95 % CI = [1.08−3.03]), and (4) speed-pedelecs rode near or at an intersection, OR = 3.94, 95 % CI = [2.42−6.43]. These findings suggest that conflict risks are higher when speed-pedelec riders make use of bicycle facilities than when they ride on the roadway for cars. However, the consequences of crashes with motorized vehicles on the roadway will probably be more severe for speed-pedelec riders than with bicycles on the cycle path. This study further illustrates the value of naturalistic conflict observations for assessing the safety implications of innovations proactively.}

abstract = {Background
Whereas an increased risk of road traffic crashes has been highlighted as linked to some medicine consumptions, there is no available data on this risk according to the type of journey (private, commuting or mission). Drivers on occupational journey (commuting or mission) are likely to have different coping behaviors related to the use of medicines than drivers on private journey. The aim of our study was to investigate the association between exposure to ten classes of medicines and the risk of being responsible for a road traffic crash according to the type of journey (private, commuting or mission).
Methods
The data used came from three French national databases: the national police database of injurious crashes, the police reports and the national health care insurance database. A total of 179,269 drivers aged between 18 and 65 years old involved in an injurious crash in France between July 2005 and December 2015 were included in the analyses. Logistic regression models stratified by journey were used to estimate the Odds Ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI), adjusted for potential confounding factors.
Results
Medicines exposure levels were generally lower for drivers during occupational journeys, the risk of being responsible for a road traffic crash seems to be higher on commuting or mission journeys than on private journeys for four medicines. Indeed, for antiepileptics the OR was 1.59 [1.01–2.51] for mission journeys, 1.63 [1.24–2.15] for commuting journeys, and 1.47 [1.25–1.73] for private journey. For psycholeptics the OR was 1.02 [0.80–1.28] for mission journey, 1.19 [1.03–1.39] for commuting and 1.17 [1.08–1.26] for private journey. For psychoanaleptics OR was 1.35 [1.02–1.78] for mission journeys, 1.37 [1.17–1.60] for commuting journeys and 1.26 [1.14–1.40] for private journeys. Finally, for other nervous system drugs OR reached 2.04 [1.35–3.07] for mission journeys compared to 1.43 [1.21–1.70] for private journeys.
Conclusion
Our results encourage the implementation of preventive measures about some treatments and diseases in the context of occupational journeys.}

It is a sequel to the paper Fatal train accidents on Europe’s railways: 1980–2009 (Evans (2011), which covers the three decades 1980–2009. The present paper discards the data for the 1980s, but adds the data for 2010−2019. The data cover the 28 countries of the European Union as in 2019, together with Norway and Switzerland. The source of the recent data is largely the European Union Agency for Railways. The estimated overall trend in the number of fatal train collisions and derailments per train-kilometre was –5.6 % per year from 1990–2019, with a 95 % confidence interval of –7.1 % to -4.2 %. The estimated accident rate in 2019 was 0.85 fatal collisions or derailments per billion train-kilometres, which represents a fall of 78 % since 1990. This gives an estimated mean number of fatal accidents in Europe in 2019 of 3.89. The data and results for 2010−2019 closely match the extrapolation of the results for 1990−2009, so that in 2009 extrapolation would have given a good forward projection for 2019. By the same argument this paper gives a forward projection of the mean number of accidents in 2029 of 2.12, assuming no change in train-kilometres, or pro-rata changes with changes in train-kilometres. The paper investigates the causes of accidents. A notable finding is that the proportion of accidents caused by signals passed at danger (SPADs) fell from 40 % in 1990−1999 to 21 % in 2010−2019. This is probably due to the increasing deployment of train protection systems. The number of fatalities in individual accidents has a skew distribution: most accidents have a small number of fatalities, but a few have a large number. The overall observed number of fatalities per accident is 4.23, and there is no indication that this mean changes with time. This implies that the mean number of fatalities per year has the same downward trend of 5.6 % per year as the mean number of accidents per year.}

Much of the existing work in this area is based on data in the police traffic collision reports, which do not include data on the characteristics of the work zone itself. This paper develops a comprehensive data set of 42 features describing time, location, work zone characteristics, traffic volume, and road properties. Using recent machine learning techniques such as extreme gradient boosting classifiers on this extensive set of features allows for more accurate analysis to identify factors that affect the risk of work zone collisions or indicate higher than baseline chances of a roadside crash. Our statistical analysis reveals 10 important features and shows that four of these features are significantly associated with higher probabilities of roadside work zone collisions.}

abstract = {Pedestrian safety has been a major concern in Hong Kong, where walking is an important access mean to urban transportation services and pedestrian-vehicle conflicts are prevalent. Red light running violation of pedestrians is a leading cause of pedestrian-vehicle crashes at the signal intersections. It is necessary to examine the possible factors including personal characteristics and road environments that affect the propensities of red light running violation of pedestrians. Therefore, effective traffic control and enforcement measures can be implemented to deter against the red light running behaviors of pedestrians. This study attempts to examine the roles of trade-off between safety and time, as well as situational features and personality traits, in the red light running behaviors of pedestrians using a stated preference survey method. Then, a regret-based panel mixed multinomial logit model is established for the association measure between propensities of red light running violation and possible factors, with which the effects of unobserved heterogeneity and correlation in the choices between different scenarios of the same person are considered. Results indicate that the choice decision of pedestrians are more sensitive to a reduction in time loss, as compared to the equivalent increase in safety risk. In addition, the safety versus time trade-off may vary between pedestrian groups. Furthermore, presence and type of another violator also significantly affect the propensities of red light running violation. Such findings are indicative to effective policy interventions that can deter against the red light running behaviors of vulnerable pedestrian groups. Therefore, overall pedestrian safety level can be improved in the long term.}

abstract = {Crash severity model is a classical topic in road safety research. The multinomial logit (MNL) model, as a basic discrete outcome method, is widely applied to measure the association between crash severity and possible risk factors. However, the MNL model has several assumptions and properties that are possibly not consistent with the actual crash mechanism, and therefore with the association measure for crash severity. One significant attribute is the variation in drivers’ safety perception. Risk-taking drivers tends to drive at a higher speed, which increases the likelihood of severe crashes. However, the variations in speed and other driving performance lead to the error in the utility function more profound. This violates the assumption of identical error distributions between different crash severity outcomes. In this paper, we propose a multinomial multiplicative (MNM) model, as an alternative for crash severity model. There are two possible formulations for the proposed MNM model: (1) Weibull and (2) Fréchet, according to the distributions of random propensities and subject to the signs of the systematic parts of the regression equation. The two heavy-tailed distributions can capture the effect of unobserved contributory factors on crash injury severity. Additionally, the MNM model can incorporate the effects of the non-identical, heavy-tailed, and asymmetric properties of the distribution, whereas the conventional MNL model cannot. Several operational considerations are also attempted in this study, including the specifications of the systematic parts and the interpretations of the parameters. The MNM model is further extended to the mixed MNM (MMNM) model by considering unobserved heterogeneities using random coefficients, while the mixed MNL (MMNL) model is used as the benchmark model. The proposed MMNM model is calibrated using the crash dataset obtained from the Guangdong Province, China. Results indicated that the proposed MMNM model outperformed the MMNL model in this case. Also, the results of parameter estimates are indicative to impact factors on crash severity as well as the design and implementation of policies. This justified the use of MMNM model as an alternative for crash severity model in practice. This is the first application of MMNM model in the traffic safety literature, it is worth exploring the application of other advanced multiplicative models for safety analysis in the future.}

This paper aims to help establish a consensus on these two fundamental matters by discussing the underlying concepts by which they can be connected in a consistent construct justified with theory and empirical evidence. The importance of insight into a safety-relevant event beyond what is externally observable is emphasized by considering two distributions of crash nearness: (1) values observed by external observers and (2) driver-preferred values that are usually unobservable. Traffic encounters and traffic conflicts are discussed here in the context of crash possibility illustrated with these two distributions. The difference between the preferred and observed crash nearness values is introduced as the delay of response to an error that violates the crash nearness preference. Traffic conflicts caused by driver errors that violate the driver populace’s minimum crash nearness are recommended for safety analysis if only external observations are available. The conditions of properly detecting such traffic conflicts and estimating the probability of crash are identified and their validity is emphasized based on the past SHRP2 study. The mentioned study identified two additional conditions for proper identification of traffic conflicts: (1) speeds sufficiently high to induce driver responses consistent with the theory and with Lomax distribution and (2) elimination of self-clearing encounters such as a preceding vehicle exiting a lane in rear-end interactions. The most encouraging finding of this study is the mentioned sufficiently high speeds that tend to coincide with collision outcomes sufficiently serious to be reportable to the authorities. Another encouraging element is the insight about preferred crash nearness values that may be brought by autonomous vehicles. The biggest challenge in applying EV modeling today is using proper safety-relevant events to ensure that the tail of a distribution estimated based on observed events is consistent with the distribution tail that represents a crash. Autonomous vehicles may help eliminate this challenge since their preferred crash nearness values should be known.}

abstract = {The propensity score (PS) based method has been increasingly used in road safety evaluation studies. However, several major considerations regarding its implementation arise when using the PS method. First, as is well known, the PS method is ‘data hungry’ in terms of the number of treated and control units, however, it is sometimes difficult and time-consuming to construct a large sample in road safety studies. It would be helpful to better understand how to choose a proper sample size, as well as the ratio of the number of treated units to the control ones. Second, the criteria used for covariates selection of the PS model were not fully consistent across the existing road safety evaluation studies. Due to the complicated mechanisms behind the implementation of road safety measures and policies, including all relevant covariates that affect both the selection into treatment (i.e., implementation of road safety measures) and the outcomes (i.e., road accidents) is impossible. In this paper, we conduct a simulation study to investigate such issues and provide some practical suggestions for using PS methods in road safety evaluations. The estimator considered in this study is the inverse probability weighting estimator based on the PS. Our results suggest that the bias and variance of the estimated treatment effect will remain stable when the sample size reaches a certain level. A proper sample size is the one that ensures relevant covariates achieve acceptable balance. Regarding the issue of covariates selection, including the covariates that significantly affect the road accidents is recommended, regardless of whether they affect the implementation of road safety measures. This study also proposes practical procedures for using the weighting approach to evaluate the effects of road safety treatments.}

abstract = {Background
The emergence of partial-automation in consumer vehicles is reshaping the driving task, the driver role, and subsequent driver behavior. When using partial-automation, drivers delegate the operational control of the dynamic driving task to the automation system, while remaining responsible for monitoring, object/event detection, response selection, and execution. Hence, driving has become a collaboration between driver and automation systems that is characterized by dynamic Transfers of Control (TOC).
Objective
This study aimed to assess how drivers leverage automation in real-world driving, identify driver and system-initiated TOCs, and provide a taxonomy to capture the underlying driver behaviors associated with automation disengagement.
Methods
Fourteen participants drove instrumented Cadillac CT6 vehicles for one-month each, yielding 1690 trips (22,108 miles), with a total of 5343 TOCs between manual driving, SAE Level 1 Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), and SAE Level 2 Super Cruise (SC).
Results
The use of automation on limited access highways was prevalent (40 % of the miles driven were with SC and 10 % with ACC) yet not continuous. Drivers frequently initiated transitions between automation levels (mean = 9.98, SD = 8.32, transitions per trip), temporarily taking over the longitudinal and/or lateral vehicle control. These transitions were not necessarily related to immediate risk mitigation, but rather to the execution of functions beyond the automation system’s capabilities or representing preferences in task execution. Driver-initiated TOCs from SC to manual driving followed the structure and temporal aspects of the hierarchical model of driver behavior. Strategic, Maneuver, and Control TOCs were associated with significantly different patterns of vehicle kinematics, automation disengagement modality, and TOC duration. System-initiated automation disengagements from SC to manual driving were rare (1%).
Conclusions
Generalizing from objective, real-world driving data, this study provides an ecologically valid taxonomy for transfer of control building upon the hierarchical model of driver behavior. We show that driver-automation interactions can occur in each level of the hierarchical model and that TOCs are part of the driver’s strategic, maneuver, and control levels of decision making. Thus, TOCs are not isolated or rare events, but rather an integral part of an ongoing, continuous and dynamic collaboration. This taxonomy contextualizes TOCs, paving the way for greater understanding of when and why drivers will takeover control, exposes the underlying motivations for TOCs, and characterizes how these are reflected in the driver’s actions. The findings can inform the development of driver-centered automation systems as well as policies and guidelines for current and future automation levels.}

However, despite their documented benefits, there are concerns about potential conflicts between bicycles and vehicles when they merge back together at an intersection. The concern is that following a period of separation, drivers are less likely to anticipate and scan for the presence of bicyclists. This research examines how transitions from fully separated to mixed-traffic environments and vice versa affect driver behavior. The goal is to assess whether certain segment-intersection treatment combinations can alert drivers of the presence of bicyclists and thus, encourage them to scan for bicyclists prior to a right turn, reducing potential right-hook conflicts. Driving simulation is utilized and driver performance for right-turning vehicles is recorded under the presence of various bicycle infrastructure treatments along segments and at intersections. The experimental design includes conventional and protected bike lanes and intersections with either intersection crossing markings or protected intersections. The results show that the presence of protected bike lanes motivates fewer glances towards bicyclists traveling on those bike lanes, therefore, reducing drivers’ ability to detect and in turn, perceive bicyclists. Drivers developed slightly lower speeds while driving next to protected versus conventional bike lanes. It was also found that protected intersections result in a higher rate of right glances at the intersection prior to a right turn. Drivers glancing at the intersection were also found to have lower speeds, indicating a correlation between the presence of protected intersection elements and speed selection. This research can be used to guide decisions on bicycle infrastructure implementation for safer multimodal operations.}

These objective measures of safety are spatially static and reflective of past events: they can be enriched by including the human response to risk at diverse infrastructure designs. This perceived risk has been well captured qualitatively in the transportation safety literature; in the following study, we seek to develop a quantitative methodology that captures perceived risk as a continuous measure of human biometrics. Building on diverse safety–critical fields, we hypothesize that the perception of safety can be measured proactively with traveler biometrics, including eye and head movements, such that high readings of biometric indicators correlate with less safe areas. We collect biometric data from cyclists traversing an urban corridor with a protected, yet not continuously, cycle lane. By isolating and correlating peaks in cyclist biometric measures with infrastructure design, we develop a set of continuous variables – lateral head movements, gaze velocity, and off-mean gaze distance, both independently and as a vector – that allow for the evaluation of urban infrastructure based on perceived risk. The results reflect that higher biometric readings correspond to less safe (i.e., unprotected) areas, indicating that perceived risk can be measured proactively with biometric data.}

We adopt an oft-used tool in mathematical finance, the Heston Stochastic Volatility model, to forecast the short-term and long-term evolution of motor vehicle collision rates. We incorporate a number of extensions to the Heston model to make it fit for modelling motor vehicle collision rates. We incorporate the temporally-unstable and non-deterministic nature of collision rate fluctuations, and introduce a parameter to account for periods of accelerated safety. We also adjust estimates to account for the seasonality of collision patterns. Using these parameters, we perform a short-term forecast of collision rates and explore a number of plausible scenarios using long-term forecasts. The short-term forecast shows a close affinity with realised rates (over 95% accuracy), and outperforms forecasting models currently used in road safety research (Vasicek, SARIMA, SARIMA-GARCH). The long-term scenarios suggest that modest targets to reduce collision rates (1.83% annually) and targets to reduce the fluctuations of month-to-month collision rates (by half) could have significant benefits for road safety. The median forecast in this scenario suggests a 50% fall in collision rates, with 75% of simulations suggesting that an effective change in collision rates is observed before 2044. The main benefit the model provides is eschewing the necessity for setting unreasonable safety targets that are often missed. Instead, the model presents the effects that modest and achievable targets can have on road safety over the long run, while incorporating random variability. Examining the parameters that underlie expected collision rates will aid policymakers in determining the effectiveness of implemented policies.}

abstract = {Understanding and quantifying the effects of risk factors on crash frequency is of great importance for developing cost-effective safety countermeasures. In this paper, the effects of key crash contributing factors on total crashes and crashes of different collision types are analyzed separately and compared. A novel Machine Learning (ML) method, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), is introduced to model a Texas dataset consisting of vehicle crashes occurred from 2015 to 2017. Compared with other commonly used ML methods such as eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), LightGBM performs significantly better in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE). In addition, the SHapley Additive explanation (SHAP) approach is employed to interpret the LightGBM outputs. Significant risk factors are identified, including speed limits, area type, number of lanes, roadway functional class, shoulder width and shoulder type. With the SHAP method, the importance, total effects, and main and interaction effects of risk factors are quantified. The results suggest that the importance of risk factors vary across collision types. Speed limit is a more important risk factor than right/left shoulder width, lane width, and median width for Rear-End (RE) crashes, while the opposite relationship is found for Run-Off-Road (ROR) crashes. Also, it is found that narrow lanes (8ft to 11ft) increase the risk for all types of crashes (i.e., Total, ROR, and RE) in this study. For road segments with 5 or 6 lanes in both directions combined, a lane width greater than or equal to 12ft may help reduce the risk of all types of crashes. These results have important implications for developing accurate crash modification factors and cost-effective safety countermeasures.}

This study mainly focuses on identifying optimal crash precursors for different freeway section types, as well as providing a threshold selection method for real-time crash risk models. Freeway sections are divided into four types, i.e. basic sections, weaving areas, merging areas, and diverging areas. Bayesian logistic regression (BLR) models were established for each type of segment, and significant factors were distinguished. A threshold selection method was proposed based on cost-benefit theory, and the threshold is determined as the value when the number of proactive safety interventions to prevent a crash is 5000 in this study. BLR models with one, two and three optimal variables were developed. Then the sensitivity and false alarm rate of the models were obtained and compared. Comparison results show that the minimum amount of parameters which can achieve the ideal prediction effectiveness is two. In this situation, 25 %, 50 %, 20 % and 20 % of the crashes occurring at basic sections, weaving areas, merging areas and diverging areas can be accurately predicted respectively. Downstream average speed was recommended as the best crash precursor variable for all the segment types. Support Vector Machine and Random Forest were applied to confirm the conclusion. The conclusion of this paper has the possibility to help reduce crash risk to a relatively economical level in practical applications.}

The results from the meta-analysis indicate that the number of conflicts is exponentially reduced as the MPR goes up. For example, compared to the environment without ICVs, 4.2% and 17.4% of conflicts would decrease at the MPR of 10% and 50%, respectively. The effects are more obvious at higher MPR—43.4% of conflicts are expected to decrease at the MPR of 90%. From the case study in the United States based on the meta-analysis, it is expected that the MPR would reach 17–20% in the near future (2025) and 40–48% in 2035. The anticipated reduction in the number of fatal crashes would be 5% and 13%, in 2025 and 2035, respectively. The findings from this study will be useful for both public and private sectors to establish strategic plans to promote ICVs and identify their benefits at different MPRs.}

To achieve this goal, high-resolution horizontal illuminance data were collected in Florida for 300 + center-miles from 2011 to 2014. Based on the data, a matched case-control study was conducted to address two major issues existing in previous studies: (1) the confounding effects of illuminance standard deviation on illuminance mean and (2) spatially-unrelated extreme values for ratio-based uniformity. By eliminating the confounding effects through a random matching strategy (one case, a segment with nighttime crashes, to one control, a segment without nighttime crashes at 1,046 strata), this study successfully isolated the negative effects of the standard deviation and developed more significant crash modification factors (CMFs) for average lighting levels: 0.679 for increasing the average lighting level from [0 fc, 0.5 fc] to (0.5 fc, 1.0 fc] and 0.581 for increasing the average lighting from [0 fc, 0.5 fc] to higher than 1.0 fc. Additionally, a CMF of 1.391 for a max-min ratio greater than 10 was identified by controlling the segment length at a short uniform unit (1,200 ft).

abstract = {Background
Road traffic injuries (RTIs) are the second leading cause of death in Saudi Arabia. Their economic burden is significant but poorly quantified, as limited literature exists locally. We aim to estimate the impact of RTIs on healthcare costs.
Methods
We included all patients from the hospital’s trauma registry for the year 2017 (n = 381). Due to the availability of data, the analysis focused only on direct medical costs incurred during the hospitalization period. We computed the components of hospitalization costs and evaluated the association between patient and RTI characteristics and total hospitalization costs (the average and median) using quantile and log-linear regression techniques respectively.
Results
Patients were relatively young with an average age of 31 years (SD ± 14.6). Overall, patients treated for RTIs cost the hospital around 77,657 Saudi Riyal (SAR) on average. Pedestrian injuries incurred the highest costs. Motor vehicle injuries accounted for the highest procedure-related costs (SAR 19,537). The quantile regressions results suggest that Glasgow coma scale (GCS), admission to intensive care unit (ICU), and hospital length of stay were significantly associated with an increase in hospitalization cost. Hospital home disposition was however, associated with a decrease in cost. One additional day of stay in the hospital increases total hospitalization cost by SAR 3,508. Additionally, the log-linear showed injury severity score (ISS < 16) was associated with a 20% decrease in the geometric mean of the hospitalization costs (p < 0.001).
Conclusions
This study underlines the economic burden of RTIs in addition to their impact on population health. The findings may be used to inform policymakers, researchers, and the public about the increasing burden of traffic crashes in the Kingdom. Public health interventions are warranted to reduce the severity and frequency of RTIs in order to improve traffic safety and reduce associated healthcare costs.}

abstract = {At “semi-controlled” crosswalks with yield signs and markings, negotiations as to the right-of-way occur frequently between pedestrians and motorists, to determine who should proceed first. This kind of “negotiation” often leads to traffic delay and potential conflicts. To minimize misunderstandings between pedestrian and motorist that can have serious safety consequences, it is essential that we understand the decision-making process as the “players” interact in real street-crossing situations. This paper employs a game-theoretic approach to investigate the joint behaviors of pedestrians and motorists from the perspective of safety. Assuming bounded rationality for each player, the quantal response equilibrium is a special kind of game with incomplete information. Explanatory variables such as conflicting risks and time savings can be incorporated into the payoff functions of the “players” via expected utility functions. Finally, model parameters can be estimated using an expectation maximization algorithm. The game-theoretic framework is applied to model pedestrian-motorist interactions at a semi-controlled crosswalk on a university campus. The estimation results indicate that the likelihood of pedestrian-vehicle conflict can be quantified. The results can lead to control measures that facilitate the negotiation between pedestrian and motorist and reduce the conflict risk at semi-controlled crosswalks.}

The potential for phones to draw attention away from the main driving task has significant consequences for road safety. Previous studies have found that the mere presence of a mobile phone can be distracting by impairing attention in experimental non-driving contexts. However, the effect of phone presence, independent to usage, has not yet been examined in the context of driving. As such, the present study examined whether the mere presence of a mobile phone, its proximity to the driver, and power status (on/off) influenced the driving performance of young drivers. Additionally, this study assessed whether the effects of phone presence and proximity were moderated by an individual’s level of dependence on, or emotional attachment to, their phone. A sample of 127 undergraduate psychology students (M = 19.76, SD = 1.63) were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: (1) phone absent (control), (2) phone on, in holder, (3) phone off, in holder, and (4) phone on, in pocket. They all completed the same simulated drive, and were measured for degree of phone dependence and phone emotional attachment. Overall, drivers in all the phone present conditions made significantly more driving errors (speeding and collision) compared to those in the phone absent (control) condition, irrespective of proximity to the phone and whether it was on or off. Phone dependence, but not phone emotional attachment, moderated the effect of phone presence on speeding behaviour. These findings suggest that the mere presence of a phone is distracting for drivers, especially so for those who are highly dependent on their phone, which may place them at a greater risk of a distraction induced crash.}

abstract = {Background
Perceived legitimacy associated with rules and authorities is an important element for understanding and encouraging compliance with rules in the field of road safety, often more so than with a deterrence approach. Despite a growing interest in legitimacy in recent decades and in the psychological field in particular, its definitions and measurements appear to be heterogeneous, subject to debate and in need of a common theoretical framework. Therefore, one can expect these limitations to also concern the definitions and measurements of legitimacy in the field of road safety. However, no literature review related to this issue is currently available. This contribution therefore aims to fill this void by proposing a scoping review investigating, in the field of road safety, how legitimacy is defined, measured, related to compliance and what are its main determinants.
Methods
A scoping review was conducted, based on research literature from eight databases and concerned with the perceived legitimacy of traffic rules or traffic enforcement and rule compliance or traffic violations. Twenty-six publications meeting inclusion criteria were retained. The characteristics and content of publications were analyzed to identify the relevant elements related to our research questions.
Results and conclusion
The main results revealed that perceived legitimacy in the field of road safety can be related to different objects (i.e., traffic rules, traffic violations, traffic enforcement, institutions) that should be better delineated and differentiated in future research. While perceived legitimacy is generally associated with compliance with traffic rules, its theoretical definitions and measures in the field of road safety are heterogeneous and present validity issues which limit the comparability of studies and so the accumulation of knowledge for both theoretical research and road safety applications. No empirical study investigating the outcomes of perceived legitimacy beyond compliance was identified. Few empirical studies have investigated the determinants of perceived legitimacy. Most identified empirical studies were cross-sectional, which is a limitation to establishing causality in investigated relationships. Theoretical implications and research perspectives to improve studies on legitimacy in the field of road safety and develop a multidimensional model of the perceived legitimacy of traffic rules are therefore proposed and discussed.}

abstract = {Objective
Knowledge regarding sickness absence (SA) and disability pension (DP) following a road traffic injury, is lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate SA and DP among injured car occupants before and after a crash, accounting for permanent medical impairment (PMI). Further, to explore associations between injured body region, car model year of introduction (MYI), and European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) safety rating and number of SA/DP days in year two and four following the crash date.
Methods
A longitudinal cohort study including 63,358 individuals injured when aged 17–62, in crashes occurring 2001–2013 and involving a car insured by the Folksam Insurance Group. Mean numbers of SA/DP net days per year were calculated, in total and by injury diagnosis category, for all, for those with SA or DP with the same diagnosis as the initial injury, and for those with and those without injuries resulting in PMI. Logistic regressions were performed to calculate odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for having 90–180 or ≥181 combined SA/DP days, respectively, among those with injury diagnoses, in year two and four after the crash. Associations with injured body region, car model introduction year, and Euro NCAP star ratings, was investigated, with adjustments made for sociodemographics.
Results
The mean number of SA/DP days/year was higher in the years following the crash (56–50 days) compared to the year prior (41). In year one and two the increase in days was mainly with SA due to injury diagnoses and musculoskeletal diagnoses, and in year three and four, with DP due to injury diagnoses, musculoskeletal diagnoses, and mental diagnoses, respectively. Individuals whose injuries resulted in PMI had more future SA/DP days compared to those without PMI. Individuals with injuries to the torso/back and with multiple injuries were more likely to have > 180 SA/DP days both year two (2.9 and 2.2 times, respectively) and year four (2.0 and 1.6 times), compared to individuals with head injuries. Injured occupants in Euro NCAP 2–3-star rated cars as well as in untested cars, were more likely to have > 180 days in year four (1.4 and 2.0 times, respectively), compared to 4–5 stars.
Conclusion
Higher levels of SA/DP remained throughout the four years following the crash, with substantial differences between those with PMI and those with no PMI. Low overall car safety level, injuries to the torso/back, and multiple injuries were associated with high SA/DP.}

Nevertheless, independently developed active or passive safety systems may lead to unsatisfactory protective performance under the critical driving scenarios. This study aimed to conduct multiobjective optimization of the cooperative controls between autonomous emergency steering (AES) and occupant restraint system (ORS) to explore the potential occupant injury reduction capability as well as mechanisms subjected to a frontal collision. First, a multiple simulation approach comprising PreScan/Simulink, LS-DYNA, Madymo was used to correlate the control parameters of the safety systems and occupant injuries quantitatively. Then the control parameters of AES and ORS were selected as the design variables after sensitivity analysis, and injury responses of the sampling points were extracted by the multiple simulation approach. Surrogate models and multiobjective optimization algorithm were used to determine the optimum design in cooperative controls of AES and ORS maneuvers, from which in-depth effect mechanisms that contributed to the improvement of occupant protection were identified. Compared to the baseline design, the optimum control parameters of AES-ORS integration substantially decreased the occupant injuries of the head, chest and neck, and consequently led to a reduction of 33.02% in the overall injury risk. This study is anticipated to demonstrate a new design approach for the control system, thereby enhancing occupant safety.}

The Lane Change Alert with Side Blind Zone Alert system reduced lane change crashes by 16%. Reverse Automatic Braking, Rear Cross Traffic Alert, Rear Park Assist, and Rear Vision Camera (where each of these systems generally included all of the preceding systems) produced, respectively, an 82%, 55%, 36%, and 24% reduction in backing crashes. For Front Pedestrian Braking, a non-significant 14% reduction was observed for the limited set of available pedestrian crash cases. Intellibeam (auto high beam headlighting), High-Intensity Discharge headlights, and the combination of these two systems provided 26%, 11%, and 32% reductions (relative to halogen headlights) in a combined set of (unlighted) nighttime animal, pedestrian, and bicyclist crashes, respectively. These results provide widespread evidence of the substantial crash avoidance and injury reduction opportunities afforded by the production systems evaluated, as well as identify untapped system opportunities for moving toward a zero crashes vision.}

The present study investigated the effects of the designed driving style of AV (aggressive/defensive) and driver’s driving style (aggressive/defensive) on driver's trust, acceptance, and take-over behavior in a fully AV. Thirty-two participants were classified into two groups based on their driving styles using the Aggressive Driving Scale and experienced twelve driving scenarios in either an aggressive AV or a defensive AV. Results revealed that driver’s trust, acceptance, and takeover frequency were significantly influenced by the interaction effects between AV’s driving style and driver’s driving style. General estimating equations were conducted to analyze the relationships between driver’s trust, acceptance, and take over frequency. The results showed that the effect of driver’s trust in AVs on takeover frequency was mediated by driver’s acceptance of AVs. These findings implied that driver’s trust and acceptance of AVs could be enhanced when the designed AV’s driving style aligned with driver’s own driving style, which in turn, reduce undesired take over behavior. However, the “aggressive” AV driving style should be designed carefully considering driver safety.}

To that end, the collision dataset of the City of Hamilton between 2010 and 2017 was reviewed to filter out pedestrian collisions that involved pedestrian violations. A Latent Class Analysis (LCA) method was applied to divide the dataset into a set of homogeneous clusters, based on traffic and intersection characteristics. A copula-based multivariate model was then developed for each cluster in order to study the impact of the different factors on collisions under the prevailing conditions of each cluster. The results showed that the number of bus stops within the intersection area is directly associated with the frequency and the severity of collisions involving pedestrian violations. A reduction in collisions was observed with the increase in the frequency of buses at intersections that are located along main transit routes. Moreover, the presence of schools near the intersection tends to increase the frequency of collisions involving pedestrian violations, especially at large intersections. The results also revealed that the presence of central refuge islands, despite their overall safety benefits, increases the likelihood of collisions involving pedestrian violations in large intersections. The results of this study provide valuable insights for a better understanding of the safety consequences of pedestrian violations. Such understanding assists engineers and planners to design intersections that reduce the frequency of pedestrian violations and mitigate their negative safety consequences.}

abstract = {A critical safety problem in road networks is the conflicts on unsignalized crosswalks. Thus, a proactive approach to assess pedestrian safety performance is required. Simulating the microscopic road user behavior in a virtual platform is one of the typical approaches. However, current simulation tools are not flexible enough to properly reproduce various behaviors of pedestrians and drivers considering their interactions with the road environment and other road users. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to propose a novel agent-based framework for evaluating pedestrian safety at unsignalized crosswalks. Unsignalized mid-block crosswalks with refuge islands (UMCR) are considered as an example facility to implement the proposed framework, where relevant behavioral elements such as the reaction time, visual field with obstacles, and minimum safety margin time are addressed. Not only the pedestrian-vehicle interaction is modeled but also the vehicle-vehicle interaction is considered. Empirical validation on a UMCR shows that the proposed framework can reproduce reliable distributions of the post encroachment time compared to the observed distributions within an acceptable error range. The sensitivity analysis reveals that the high reaction time of drivers, small safety margin time, and visual obstacles near crosswalks increase the probability of serious conflicts. The results also show that the framework can reproduce traffic crashes under assumed extreme road conditions.}

The real and perceived hazards of cycling in urban areas and sharing roads with other motorized vehicles have been identified as a major barrier to wider adoption of ebikes. The objective of this study is to investigate parameters that affect the anxiety level of cyclists, which influences their safety and interaction with other road users. An ebike was instrumented with a variety of sensors and equipment to monitor the speed, balance of bike, type, and proximity of vehicles overtaking cyclists, as well as the events on the road. Thirty-two participants rode the instrumented ebike for 12 km on urban roads in Oshawa, ON, Canada. Participants wore a heart rate sensor attached to their chest and a helmet equipped with a peripheral detection task setup to measure stress and mental workload. This naturalistic study showed that most participants had concerns about the threats and risks of crashes when sharing the road with other vehicles. The data showed that the significant difference in acceleration between ebikes and conventional bikes does not change the perception of safety for cyclists. Additionally, the outcomes indicate that mental workload and average heart rate increase at lower speeds when passing a queue of vehicles in traffic or at intersections. Across all participants, the balance of the bike did not change significantly. Also, neither the heart rate nor mental workload showed a significant effect on the balance of the bike. This study suggests that dense traffic in the afternoon and the demands of riding a bike in complex traffic conditions result in a higher mental workload even though cyclists slowed down their speeds. Furthermore, the majority reported perceived risks of cycling on a shared road with other vehicles regardless of the demographic differences. The findings from this study can be used as a framework for the development of active safety features for ebikes.}

Alberta remains the only province in Canada without booster seat legislation. To date, analyses of booster seat effectiveness compared with seatbelt only use have demonstrated mixed findings using observational data.
Methods
This study uses Alberta police collision report data for the years 2010–2016, inclusive. Using a case-control study design, children aged four to eight years, who were reported by police to be injured (cases), were compared with uninjured controls for restraint use (seatbelt, booster seat or no restraint). Logistic regression was used to estimate the relation between booster seat use and injury with adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), stratified by collision types.
Results
There were 12,922 children involved in collisions, of whom 570 were injured. Approximately 62% of all children included in the analysis were in a booster seat or safety seat at the time of collision. Crude analysis indicates higher odds of injury for seatbelt wearers compared with booster seat use (OR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.02–1.44). Front-end vehicle-vehicle collisions, demonstrated higher odds of injury for seatbelt wearers relative to those in booster seats (aOR = 1.46; 95% CI: 1.03–2.07).
Conclusion
This analysis indicates a protective effect of booster seats that varies depending on the type of collision and impact location. These regionally-specific injury data may encourage and inform policy on the use of booster seats. Moreover, stratification by collision type may be necessary to inform analyses on booster seat effectiveness.}

abstract = {Objective
The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of the nationwide response to passenger airbag (PA) related deaths of children. The response was implemented in 1996 and focused on moving children to rear seats. This study determined the change in seating position of children from 1989 to 2019.
Methods
Field accident data on exposed occupants in towaway crashes was determined using 1989–2015 NASS-CDS in five groups (1989–1995, 1996–99, 2000–04, 2005–09 and 2010–15) and 2017–19 CISS in one group. Children were grouped as 0–2 yo (years old), 3–7 yo and 8–12 yo. Occupants 13 + were included for completeness. Seat position was defined as left-front (LF), right-front (RF), 2nd row and 3rd row. The weighted data provided an estimate for the change in seating position over time by occupant age with standard errors.
Results
For 0–2 yo, 27.9% were in the RF seat in 1989–95. The fraction decreased to 0.40% in the 2017–19 (p < 0.001). For 3–7 yo, 32.1% were in the RF seat in 1989–95 and 3.2% in 2017–19 (p < 0.001). There has been a steady decrease in 0–7 yo using the RF seat. For 8–12 yo, there was a step decline in use of the RF seat from 39.5% in 1989–95 to 23.2% in the 2017–19 (p < 0.001).
Conclusions
The immediate reduction in front-seat use among younger children was associated with the nationwide public information efforts implemented in 1996 to move children to rear seats. Children up to 7 yo are no longer riding in the RF seat of vehicles in towaway crashes, unless there is no other option. Children 8–12 yo are still using the RF seat, but at a lower rate. The change in use of the RF seat for children 0–7 yo provides evidence that safety campaigns on placing young children in rear seats were successful in the US.}

Our study intends to investigate the spatial effects of population, land use, and bicycle lane infrastructures on bicycle crashes. This was done by developing a semi-parametric Geographically Weighted Poisson Regression (sGWPR) model which deals with the issue of spatial correlation and spatial non-stationarity simultaneously. It is a model that combines both constant and geographically varying parameters. To determine which parameter is fixed or non-stationary, previous studies suggest monitoring the Akaike Information Criterion (AICc). Yet, relying only on AICc might bury some spatial associations. So, in this study, we propose a Linear Model of Coregionalization (LMC) to assist the decision. Here, we use bicycle crash data across the metropolitan area of Greater Melbourne to establish sGWPR models suggested by AICc and LMC, respectively. Comparing the two sGWPR models, we found the sGWPR model under LMC results performs as well as sGWPR models suggested by AICc from the AICc perspective, and a 22.5% improvement in the mean squared error (MSE). It also uncovers more details about the spatial relationship between bicycle crashes and bicycle lane intersection density (BLID), an effect not suggested under AICc results. The parameters of BLID, a new measurement of bicycle lane facilities proposed by us, vary over space across analysis zones in Greater Melbourne.}

Underlying causal factors to identified risks and obstacles were identified, based on human, vehicle (PWC) and environmental factors in accordance with the Haddon Matrix.
Results
The results show significant potential for improvement within all three perspectives of the Haddon Matrix used in the analysis. Participants faced and dealt with various obstacles and risks in order to reach their destination. For example, this includes uneven surfaces, differences in ground levels, steep slopes, as well as interactions with other road users and the influence of weather conditions, resulting in PWC users constantly accommodating and coping with the shortcomings of the vehicle and the environment.
Conclusions
There are still major challenges with regard to preventing obstacles and risks in the traffic environment for PWC users. To discern PWC users in traffic accident and injury data bases, a start would be to register type of aid used for persons involved in an accident. Furthermore, to emphasise PWC users’ role as VRUs, it may also be advantageous to describe them as drivers rather than users when navigating the traffic environment. Given the limited sample, further research covering more data from a broader perspective would be beneficial. By incorporating emerging knowledge of PWC users’ prerequisites and needs, and including them in research and traffic planning, the society will grow safer and more inclusive, and become better prepared for meeting future demands on accessibility from an aging population.}

abstract = {Work zone safety management and research relies heavily on the quality of work zone crash data. However, it is possible that a police officer may misclassify a crash in structured data due to: restrictive options in the crash report; a lack of understanding about their importance; lack of time due to police officers’ work load; and ignorance of work zone as one of the crash contributing factors. Consequently, work zone crashes are under representative in crash statistics. Crash narratives contain valuable information that is not included in the structured data. The objective of this study is to develop a classifier that applies text mining techniques to quickly find missed work zone (WZ) crashes through the unstructured text saved in the crash narratives. The study used three-year crash data from 2017 to 2019. The data from 2017 to 2018 was used as training data, and the 2019 data was used as testing data. A unigram + bigram noisy-OR classifier was developed and proven to be an efficient and effective means of classifying work zone crashes based on key information in the crash narrative. The ad-hoc analysis of misclassified work zone crashes sheds light on when, where and the plausible reasons as to why work zone crashes are more likely to be missed.}

abstract = {Crash data is usually aggregated over time where temporal correlation contributes to the unobserved heterogeneity. Since crashes that occur in temporal proximity share some unobserved characteristics, ignoring these temporal correlations in safety modeling may lead to biased estimates and a loss of model power. Seasonality has several effects on cyclists’ travel behavior (e.g., the distribution of holidays, school schedules, weather variations) and consequently cyclist-vehicle crash risk. This study aims to account for the effect of seasonality on cyclist-vehicle crashes by employing two groups of models. The first group, seasonal cyclist-vehicle crash frequency, employs four vectors of the dependent variables for each season. The second group, rainfall involved cyclist-vehicle crash frequency, employs two vectors of the dependent variables for crashes that occurred on rainy days and non-rainy days. The two model groups were investigated using three modeling techniques: Full Bayes crash prediction model with spatial effects (base model), varying intercept and slope model, and First-Order Random Walk model with a spatial–temporal interaction term. Crash and volume data for 134 traffic analysis zones (TAZ’s) in the City of Vancouver were used. The results showed that the First-Order Random Walk model with spatial–temporal interaction outperformed the other developed models. Some covariates have different associations with crashes depending on the season and rainfall conditions. For example, the seasonal estimates for the bus stop density are significantly higher for the summer and spring seasons than for the winter and autumn seasons. Also, the intersection density estimate for a rainy day is significantly higher than a non-rainy day. This indicates that on a rainy day each intersection to the network adds more risk to cyclists compared to a non-rainy day.}

Therefore, this study aimed to clarify how older drivers assess their driving performance and examine factors related to the level of inaccuracy in their self-assessments. Japanese drivers aged 70 years or older (N = 181) were asked to assess their own driving performance by questionnaire and then to drive on a public road while wearing an electronic device that measured their actual driving behaviors. They were accompanied by a driving instructor who sat in the passenger seat and assessed their driving performance. The results showed that older drivers’ self-assessments were significantly higher than the experts’ assessments of their driving performance. This tendency applied to all driving competencies, including overall rating, speed, and scanning. In addition, there were greater discrepancies between self-assessments and expert assessments for drivers who were rated poorly by experts compared with those who were highly rated. Drivers with a greater rating discrepancy were likely to drive faster around an intersection with a stop sign. This discrepancy was also related to a low entropy rate (low randomness in head rotation) around a signalized T-junction. These findings based on on-road driving assessments provide credible evidence of performance overestimation by older drivers. Furthermore, the results suggest that making older drivers recognize the evaluative criteria might be effective for reducing the discrepancy between self-assessments and expert assessments. It was also suggested that improving the accuracy of one’s self-assessment had the potential to improve driving behaviors such as choice of speed and scanning behavior.}

RDT operations have been expanding and evolving in Queensland since their introduction in 2007, with the number of tests increasing by 5.63 times between 2009 and 2019. The objective of this paper was to explore trends and characteristics of the 60,551 positive results detected in Queensland’s RDT program (from January 2015 to June 2020), which focuses on the detection of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), Methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA) and methamphetamine (MA). The analysis indicated that (over the entire testing period) MA was the most common drug detected in isolation (39.4%), followed by THC (34%) and the combination of MA and THC (21.9%). When considering detections with two or more drugs, MA was present in 64% of detections, THC in 59% and MDMA in 1.8%. THC was most commonly detected among younger drivers (e.g., aged 16 to 24), while MA was most commonly detected with drivers aged 25 and 59 years. Analysis of sociodemographic and contextual factors revealed that positive roadside tests were most commonly associated with males who had consumed methamphetamines, aged between 30 and 39 who were driving a car on a Friday or Saturday between 2:00 pm and 6:00 pm. The findings provide some indication as to the extent of drug driving within Queensland (and growing use of MA) and have clear implications for enforcement activities, not least, directing sufficient resources to address the burgeoning problem.}

This study proposes a novel approach in rear-end collision risk analysis based on the concept of transition durations. The vehicle trajectory data were extracted and the TTC index was used to identify risky and safe conditions. Three important transition durations are defined and their rationalities for evaluating rear-end collision risks are examined by developing random-parameters accelerated failure time (AFT) survival models. Furthermore, a typical case from real trajectory data is taken to discuss the limitations of using TTC and its variants, and the advantage of the proposed transition durations. The results of random-parameters AFT models reveal contributing factors affecting the length of three durations and demonstrate the rationality of transition durations in rear-end collision risks analysis. It is indicated that the proposed method outperforms TTC and its variants in evaluating rear-end collision risks, because it could not only provide the information of time point but also the variation of time-series data.}

This issue is potentially important for young drivers with symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) since they have known difficulties anticipating and mitigating potential hazards on the road, a skill which requires attention. The objective of this study is to investigate how the use of partially automated (L2) systems and manual systems impacts hazard anticipation and mitigation among young drivers with varying levels of ADHD symptomatology. Sixty-eight drivers, classified into two groups – high and low ADHD symptomatology—navigated twice through three scenarios on a driving simulator, once with an L2 and once with a manual system. The results indicated that: (i) the hazard anticipation skills of drivers with both high and low ADHD symptomatology were depressed in the L2 condition relative to the manual condition; (ii) the hazard mitigations skills of drivers with both high and low ADHD symptomatology were depressed in the L2 condition relative to the manual condition on two measures, but improved on a third measure; and (iii) the hazard anticipation and mitigation skills of drivers with high and low ADHD symptomatology were differentially impacted, both within and across the two levels of automation. Taken together, the results indicate the pernicious and often hard to predict consequences of higher levels of automation for different populations of younger drivers.}

Although there has been a proliferation of studies that attempt to estimate the spatiotemporal impact of a traffic incident, most, if not all, of them focus exclusively on the differentiation of bi-level traffic status. In this research, we propose to incorporate multiple congestion levels in the spatiotemporal analysis for the impact of a traffic incident, which is new to the literature. The input to our model includes the historical speed on a given road and the occurrence time and location of the incident. The model then outputs the spatiotemporal impact region with multiple congestion levels. We first use a discriminant indicator to initially indicate the traffic status according to the travelling speed of probe vehicles. We then develop an integer programming model with a set of novel constraints to estimate the spatiotemporal region impacted by the incident. Unlike existing studies that only distinguish between uncongested and congested status, our model allows us to determine the impact region with diverse congestion levels. We validate our model using both simulation and real data. Results demonstrate that our approach can not only ensure the consistency of the propagation of shockwaves even when multiple congestion levels are incorporated, but also produce more accurate estimation of the delay caused by the incident when compared to the current state-of-the-art approach.}

abstract = {Speed pedelecs (s-pedelecs) are electric bicycles offering pedal assistance up to 45 km/h. S-pedelecs may contribute to a more efficient and green traffic system. However, their potential to reach high speeds has raised road safety concerns. In the Netherlands a new legislation bans s-pedelecs from bicycle paths in urban areas. On the roads with a maximum speed limit of 50 km/h with adjacent bicycle paths, s-pedelec riders must use the roadways instead of the bicycle path. The impact of this legislation on the behaviour of s-pedelec riders and other road users as well as the possible consequences for road safety are yet unknown. Therefore, this naturalistic riding study investigated the safety-relevant behaviours of s-pedelec riders, i.e. speed characteristics while riding on the roadway, the extent of non-compliance with the ban on using bicycle paths, and speed and speed adaptation while using bicycle paths. Furthermore the study explored factors possibly influencing rider behaviour (the s-pedelec's motor-power, riders’ beliefs and perceptions) as well as negative reactions of other road users encountering s-pedelec riders. 28 participants used a s-pedelec (a 350 W type or a 500 W type) for everyday trips for at least a fortnight. The s-pedelecs were equipped with two action cameras with integrated sensors and GPS. The results showed that mean speed on 50 km/h roadways was 31.8 km/h, which is far below the road's speed limit. The mean speed did not differ between s-pedelec types, but the speed distribution did. The ‘500 W riders’ travelled 31.7% of the total distance in the 41–50 km/h speed band, as compared to 6.9% of the ‘350 W riders’. Furthermore the 500 W riders evaluated riding on the roadway more positively than the 350 W riders. On the roadway s-pedelec riders experienced signals of hinderance of the traffic flow (on average every 2 km) and negative reactions from drivers (on average every 27.5 km). As for non-compliance riders covered on average 22.5% of the distance on bicycle paths. The more the riders disagreed with the new legislation, the more distance they covered on the bicycle path. Mean speed on bicycle paths was 28.5 km/h, and it was significantly higher for 500 W riders than for 350 W riders. Speeds between 41 and 50 km/h were also far more common for 500 W riders (14.9% of the distance) than for 350 W riders (0.5%). Compared to the roadway 350 W riders reduced their speed on the bicycle paths to a higher extent (from 31.4 to 25.7 km/h) than 500 W riders did (from 31.9 to 30.5 km/h). The frequency of harsh braking of s-pedelec riders was low and did not differ between the roadway and the bicycle paths. In conclusion, s-pedelec riders in the Netherlands frequently ride on the bicycle paths although it is illegal. On the bicycle paths their speeds are much higher than those of conventional cyclists. On the 50 km/h-roadways, however, s-pedelec riders are apparently too slow for the traffic conditions. Overall, the speed profiles of 350 W types were better suited to the bicycle paths, whereas those of 500 W types to the roadways.}

Therefore, measuring the crash risk on bus routes provides an opportunity to improve the safety performance of transit operators. Previous research has explored the effects of many factors regarding the frequency and severity of bus crashes, whereas only a handful of studies have defined some crash risk indexes. Conversely, to the best of our knowledge, almost no research has been done regarding the crash risk in the bus transit network that integrates frequency, severity, and the exposure factors. This paper proposes a new framework to assess the crash risk for each transit bus route by the integration of safety factors, prediction models and risk methods. More precisely, this framework identifies several safety factors and specifies the risk components in terms of frequency, severity and exposure factors that may affect bus crashes. Then, it models their relationships to build a bus crash risk function. Lastly, according to the values returned by the previous function, the crash risk for each route is computed and a safety performance ranking for each route is provided. The feasibility of this framework is demonstrated in a real case study by using bus crash data provided by a mid-sized Italian bus operator. The findings show that transit managers could implement this framework in a road traffic safety management system to evaluate the risk of crashes on routes, monitor the safety performance of each route and qualify each route according to recent safety norms.}

However, there is rare seen any equivalent measures especially for distance control. More importantly, the visual perceptual mechanism of road markings on driving behaviors and crash risk is still blur. Given this, in the present study, we comprehensively quantified the effects of reverse linear perspective (RLP) from its origin as a visual cue, produced by a kind of transverse line markings on road, and explored the effects on car-following behaviors and crash risk variations by path analyses imbedded in a structural equations model, which was approximated with naturalistic driving and traffic flow data. In the model, multiple sources of observed factors in visual perception, driver behaviors, and traffic flow characteristics, and exogenous unobserved factors of distance risk perception, speed risk perception, and platoon risk status were comprehensively structured to explain the vehicle crash risk variation and the platoon crash risk variation. The results indicate that (1) distance risk perception, speed risk perception, and platoon risk status were well explanatory and predictive to vehicle crash risk variation and platoon crash risk variation; (2) the effects of reverse linear perspective as a visual cue on driving behaviors and crash risk variations in car-following were adequately quantified by its geometrical characteristics concerning distance perception; (3) the visual cue of reverse linear perspective in addition with initial distance, stopping sight distance, and the type of leading vehicles explained 33 % of the variance in distance risk perception; the temporal frequency, initial speed, and the type of following vehicles explained 23 % of the variance in speed risk perception; distance risk perception, speed risk perception, and platoon risk status combinedly explained 25 % and 22 % of the total variance in vehicle crash risk variation and platoon crash risk variation, respectively; (4) vehicle crash risk variation and platoon crash risk variation were equivalently specified by those observed explanatory factors. The findings of this study suggest the usefulness and importance of understanding the contribution of psychological factors on crash risk, and emphasize that the road markings can be an effective and readily practical countermeasure in easing traffic safety issues.}

Naturalistic driving data allows for the direct observation of speeding and the development of evidence-based causal structures for this behavior. This limits biases associated with self-reported speeding prevalence, allowing for more precise speeding measures than post-crash investigations and for the evaluation of driver attributes associated with speeding across a wide variety of locations and road types. Data from the Second Strategic Highway Research Program Naturalistic Driving Study were used to identify speeding events that were aggregated based on their duration and degree of speeding above the posted speed limit. The events were summarized as a likelihood of speeding metric for each trip in the dataset. These likelihood of speeding measurements were also aggregated across drivers and compared, using a beta binomial regression model, to driver questionnaire answers that addressed drivers’ perception of their speeding as well as different driver-specific factors that are suspected of having an influence on speeding behaviors. Results showed that, consistent with past studies, age and gender significantly influenced the likelihood of speeding. For age, the odds of speeding exhibited a significant downward trend across increasing age groups; 16–24 year olds exhibited odds of speeding that were 1.5 times the odds of drivers that were 80 or more years old. For gender, males exhibited larger odds of speeding than females (1.1 times larger). In addition, the odds of speeding were larger at lower posted speed limits. The odds of speeding in 10–20 mph zones were 9.5 times the odds of zones with speed limits greater than 60 mph, implying that drivers may be unaware of the risks associated with speeding in low speed limit areas. Several questionnaire answers related to drivers’ perception of speeding were also predictive of the likelihood of speeding.}

Most research into curve driving behaviour is focussed at the behaviour inside the curve, although the speed selection is done before curve entry. The main objective of this research is to identify which freeway characteristics play a role in driving speed selection. High Frequency Floating Car Data, detailed reconstruction of the curves and their surroundings, as well as three dimensional sight distance analysis, were used to analyse individual speed profiles on 153 Dutch freeway curves. By defining the positions where the acceleration approaches 0 m/s2 before and after a curve starts, the positions when the driver started and stopped decelerating upon curve entry were defined. Further correlation and regression analysis of those positions revealed that the radius of the curve is indeed a main explaining variable, as well as the speed driven before deceleration starts. Sight distances and cross section characteristics play a further role in determining the position where deceleration starts. Deceleration ends at approximately 135 m after curve start, and the speed in a curve is also correlated with the deflection angle and length of a curve. Sight distances do not play a role in selecting the speed in a curve based on this research. Overall, the findings indicate a non-constant nature and variability of speed behaviour upon curve entry. This can be used for safer freeway curve design and to assess traffic safety based on actual speed behaviour.}

abstract = {Noninvasive EEG signals provide neural activity information at high resolution, of which human mental status can be properly detected. However, artefacts always exist in brain oscillatory EEG signals and thus impede the accuracy and reliability of relevant analysis, especially in real-world tasks. Moreover, the use of a mature artefact identification method cannot assure impeccable artefact separation; this leads to a trade-off between removing contaminated information and losing valuable information. This study addresses this problem by investigating a simulator-based driving behaviour analysis using a car-following scenario to correlate the EEG-based mental features with behavioural responses. The study develops an architecture for an artefact composition pool and proposes three integrated prediction models to evaluate the removal compositions of the EEG artefacts. Three errors (mean absolute, root mean square, mean absolute percentage) and R-squared index are considered for measuring the performance of the models. The results show that the best-performing composition outperformed the no-removal and all-removal cases by 11.75% and 4.28% improvements, respectively. Specifically, we investigate different common artefacts including eye blinks, horizontal eye movements, vertical eye movements, generic discontinuities and muscle artefacts. The gained knowledge on artefact removal, EEG spectral features and stimuli-response patterns can be further applied to properly manipulate real-world EEG signals and develop an effective brain-computer interface.}

abstract = {Work zones are established to provide a safe environment for all road users and road workers. However, based on the statistics, they can be considered as crash prone zones due to changes in the road alignments and the posted speed limits. In this driving simulator study, we aimed at investigating the safety impacts of a newly proposed system composed of graphical and animation-based variable message signs (VMSs) in the state of Qatar. The proposed VMS condition was compared with a control condition that was designed following the Qatar Work Zone Traffic Management Guide. A total of seventy subjects were invited to participate in the experiment voluntarily. Study results showed that in the VMS condition, drivers reduced their traveling speeds in advanced compared to the control condition. Drivers’ traveling speed in the VMS condition was significantly reduced by 6.3 and 11.1 km/h on the leftmost and the second leftmost lanes, respectively. Next, the results uncovered that the proposed system motivated drivers to initiate early lane changing maneuvers, i.e., 150 m earlier than the control condition. Finally, the VMS condition was effective in stimulating drivers to keep larger headways with a merging vehicle. In sum, the proposed VMS system outperformed the control condition in terms of speed reduction, early merging, and higher headways between the through and the merging vehicle.}

The causal link between regulatory initiatives to improve safety culture and a potential decline in accidents may, however, appear like a “black box”, involving social processes that seem hard to foresee and influence. We need a better conceptual understanding of this. The aims of our study are to: 1) Map studies of regulatory efforts to influence safety culture in companies, 2) Use the identified studies to develop a conceptual model of the analytical relationships between regulatory initiatives to improve safety culture and accidents in these studies, including the factors influencing these analytical relationships and 3) discuss practical implications. The review is reported according to PRISMA-guidelines, and focuses on professional transport (aviation, sea, rail, road) and the Norwegian petroleum sector. Our review indicates at least six analytical relationships, mediating between regulatory attempts to influence organizational safety culture and accidents. These are between: 1) Rules and regulators, 2) Regulators and companies, 3) Managers and employees in the companies, 4) Organizational members’ shared ways of thinking and acting, which are the two key elements of safety culture, 5) Safety culture and safety behaviour, and between 6) Safety behaviour and accidents. Regulatory attempts to influence safety culture may fail or succeed at each level, through factors involved in the different relationships.}

abstract = {Perceptual markings on roads are verified with short-term effectiveness for accident prevention. However, the long-term performance of them is seldomly investigated, which unintentionally impedes its more widely recognition and application as a low-cost and readily achievable countermeasure. Also, the previous perceptual markings were only tested for speed reduction effect, little is known concerning their influence on headway adjustment. Given this, in this study, we investigated the short-, medium-, and long-term performance of the reverse linear perspective markings (RLPMs) on driving behaviors and safety benefits in car-following. The RLPMs were a form of markings pattern that can produce reverse linear perspective visual information on the lane and lead to distance underestimation. The RLPMs were permanently installed on a straight and a curve segment of a freeway in China, and the naturalistic vehicle flow data one day, four months, one year, two years, and three years after the installation of the RLPMs were collected. The statistical analyses of general and sectional relative differences of speed, distance headway and time headway suggest that 1) the speed reduced and distance and time headways increased in short-, medium-, and long-term as compared with the baseline on both the straight and curve segments; 2) the long-term performance of RLPMs significantly weakened as compared with the short-term performance, yet sustained to 0.50 m/s in speed reduction, 3.77 m in distance headway increase, and 0.097 s in time headway increase on average within the observations in one year and above on the straight segment; similar sustained performance of 0.47 m/s in speed reduction, 2.60 m in distance headway increase, and 0.072 s in time headway increase were observed on the curve segment; 3) the RLPMs were tested to have positive and relatively endured effectiveness on mitigating crash risk in car-following measured by two surrogate safety indicators based on time-to-crash (TTC) and deceleration rate to avoid a crash (DRAC). The findings of this study suggest the RLPMs could be an especially applaudable form of perceptual markings as they are relatively effective in the long-term and are multifunctional in intervening speed, distance, headway, and crash risk. This study also emphasizes the challenge of more field tests and observations on the long-term performance of the perceptual markings, and the thorough considerations of the visual perception mechanism behind the markings to achieve an alternative solution to the long-term issue.}

Participants had a distance sensor and two video cameras fitted to their bicycle for two weeks while they cycled on their usual routes, producing 46,769 events where a motor vehicle passed a bicycle. This was the largest study to-date to record passing behavior on public roads, and a large number of road and traffic attributes that might affect passing distance were included in the analysis. When drivers pass cyclists on roads with painted bicycle lanes, they tend to give more space than on roads without bicycle lanes. This is true even when controlling for the space available on the roadway. Drivers also travel in a more predictable fashion, with less variability in passing distances when a bicycle lane is present. Protected bicycle lanes completely remove the risk of passing events less than 1 m. However, where it is not possible to build a protected bicycle lane it is preferable to have a painted bicycle lane than no bicycle lane at all. Other protective factors include: wider lanes, single lane roads, smaller vehicles, and the removal of on-street parking.}

Determining which section of a road and which driving behaviour is “safe” or “unsafe” is rarely possible due to the individual differences in driving experience, driving style, fitness and potentially available assistant systems. This study investigates the feasibility of a new approach to quantify motorcycle riding risk for an experimental sample of bikers by collecting motorcycle-specific dynamic data of several riders on selected road sections. Comparing clustered dynamics with the observed dynamic data at known risk spots, we provide a method to represent individual risk estimates in a single risk map for the investigated road section. This yields a map of potential risk spots, based on an aggregation of individual risk estimates. The risk map is optimized to include most of the previous accident sites, while keeping the overall area classified as risky small. As such, with data collected on a large scale, the presented methodology could guide safety inspections at the highlighted areas of a risk map and be the basis of further studies into the safety relevant differences in driving styles.}

Due to the e-bike’s popularity and vulnerability, e-bike crash occurrence has become a major traffic safety problem in many cities across the world; finding the most important human factors affecting e-bike safety has thus been an important recent issue in traffic safety analysis. Since delivery riders are a key group of e-bike users, and since helmet use plays a crucial role in reducing the severity of a crash, this study conducted a city-wide online survey to analyze the helmet usage of 6,941 delivery riders in Shanghai, China. To determine the in-depth mechanisms influencing helmet use and e-bike crash occurrence, including the direct and indirect effects of the relevant factors, two mediator ordered logistic regression models were employed. The mediator ordered logistic model was compared with the traditional logistic regression model, and was found to be superior for modeling indirect as well as direct influencing factors. Results indicate that riders’ familiarity with traffic regulations (FTR) is an extremely important variable mediating between the independent variables of riders’ educational level and age, and the dependent variables of helmet use and e-bike crashes. Improving riders’ FTR can consequently increase helmet use and decrease crash occurrence. Authorities can apply these findings to develop appropriate countermeasures, particularly in legislation and rider training, to improve e-bike safety.}

However, due to differences in perception abilities between autonomous vehicles and human drivers, the current geometric design controls for highway alignments, designed for the human driver, may not be applicable to the autonomous vehicle (AV). Few studies, however, have systematically investigated the design controls for autonomous vehicles, though we face full driving automation in the next few decades. Because the range of modern AV sensors reaches 250 m, with expected further improvements in the near future, there is a need to determine how the sensors’ perception field and perception-reaction time may affect the current road design standards developed for human drivers. This study therefore tested the feasibility of the current design controls for fully-autonomous vehicles by separately computing controls for vertical alignments and combined horizontal and vertical alignments, considering the AV’s perception abilities of perception-reaction time (PRT), sensor height, and upward angle from the horizontal. The required stopping sight distance (SSD) and minimum length of sag and crest vertical curves were derived and compared with those for human drivers. Computations for combined alignments were based on Green Book coordination guidelines: as the minimum length of horizontal curve can be used for alignments adhering to guidelines, preview sight distance (PVSD) was computed for alignments that do not. Results showed that 1) AV-based design controls on vertical curves were more tolerant than those based on human drivers; and 2) the dominating criterion of sag vertical curve design control was comfort for autonomous vehicles, versus required SSD for human drivers.}

abstract = {Crash data analysis is commonly subjected to imbalanced data. Varied by facility and control types, some crash types are more frequent than others. However, uncommon crash types are routinely more severe and associated with higher economic and societal costs, and thus crucial to prevent. It is paramount to develop inferential models that can reliably predict crash types and identify attributing factors, especially for the severe types. The current process of modeling towards infrequent events generally disregards disparity in data representation, which can lead to biased models. Therefore, mitigating and managing imbalanced data is essential to the development of meaningful and robust models that help reveal effective countermeasures. This study focuses on comparing the effects of resampling techniques on the performance of both machine learning and classical statistical models for classifying and predicting different crash types on freeways. Specifically, a mixed sampling approach featuring a cluster-based under-sampling coupled with three popular over-sampling methods (i.e., random over-sampling, synthetic minority over-sampling, and adaptive synthetic sampling) were investigated with respect to four crash classification models, including three ensemble machine learning models (CatBoost, XGBoost, and Random Forests) and one classic statistical model (Nested Logit). This study concluded that all three resampling methods consistently enhanced the performance of all models. Among the three over-sampling methods, the adaptive synthetic sampling approach performed best and tremendously improved the prediction of minority crash types without impeding the prediction of the majority crash type. This is likely due to the density-based approach of adaptive synthetic sampling in creating synthetic instances that are more congruent with the underlying manifold structure embodied in the high-dimensional feature space.}

abstract = {Alcohol is a global risk factor for road trauma. Although drink driving has received most of the scholarly attention, there is growing evidence of the risks of alcohol-impaired walking. Alcohol-impaired pedestrians are over-represented in fatal crashes compared to non-impaired pedestrians. Additionally, empirical evidence shows that alcohol intoxication impairs road-crossing judgements. Besides some limited early research, much is unknown about the global prevalence and determinants of alcohol-impaired walking. Understanding alcohol-impaired walking will support health promotion initiatives and injury prevention. The present investigation has three aims: (1) compare the prevalence of alcohol-impaired walking across countries; (2) identify international groups of pedestrians based on psychosocial factors (i.e., Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and perceptions of risk); and (3) investigate how segments of pedestrians form their intention for alcohol-impaired walking using the extended TPB (i.e. subjective norm, attitudes, perceived control, and perceived risk). A cross-sectional design was applied. The target behaviour question was “have you been a pedestrian when your thinking or physical ability (balance/strength) is affected by alcohol?” to ensure comparability across countries. Cluster analysis based on the extended TPB was used to identify groups of countries. Finally, regressions were used to predict pedestrians’ intentions per group. A total of 6,166 respondents (Age M(SD) = 29.4 (14.2); Males = 39.2%) completed the questionnaire, ranging from 12.6% from Russia to 2.2% from Finland. The proportion of participants who reported never engaging in alcohol-impaired walking in the last three months ranged from 30.1% (Spain) to 83.1% (Turkey). Four groups of countries were identified: group-1 (Czech Republic, Spain, and Australia), group-2 (Russia and Finland), group-3 (Japan), and group-4 (final ten countries including Colombia, China, and Romania). Pedestrian intentions to engage in alcohol- impaired walking are predicted by perceptions of risk and TPB-psychosocial factors in group-1 and group-4. Favourable TPB-beliefs and low perceived risk increased alcohol-impaired walking intentions. Conversely, subjective norms were not significant in group-2 and only perceived risk predicted intention in group-3. The willingness of pedestrians to walk when alcohol-impaired differs significantly across the countries in this study. Perceived risk was the only common predictor among the 16 countries.}

abstract = {Lower severity cycling collisions, and single cyclist collisions (or single bicycle crashes) are significantly underreported in police statistics, introducing biases into the types of collisions that are available for analysis. Furthermore, many lower severity collisions do not appear in other collision data sources (e.g. hospital and insurance data). This in turn affects priorities for cyclist safety and puts an underemphasis on certain collision types. Due to an absence of data, little is known of the configurations of unreported collisions. In this paper, data from a recent self-reporting survey of cycling collisions in Ireland is used to provide details of cyclist collisions with motorised vehicles and single cyclist collisions, with the inclusion of unreported collision types. Pre-crash scenarios and impact configurations for cyclist collisions with bonnet-type vehicles, and collision factors and fall types for single cyclist collisions are coded. Injury patterns and police underreporting levels are compared, and representative collision scenarios are identified. This study highlights the relative importance of collisions resulting from the cyclist and vehicle travelling in the same direction, specifically, nearside-hook, vehicle lane changing, and overtaking manoeuvres are emphasised. Furthermore, cases involving the cyclist struck from the side by vehicle fronts comprise a smaller share than previous studies. Specifically, side to side impacts, impacts between the front of the cyclist/bicycle and the side of the vehicle, and impacts with open(ing) doors emerge as important impact configurations with the inclusion of self-reported cases. For single cyclist collisions, the importance of loss of traction of the tyres due to slippery road conditions and interactions with tram tracks and kerbs are emphasised. Fall types differ between single cyclist collision scenarios and are related to differences in injury severity. These findings add to existing knowledge for fatal and higher severity collisions, demonstrating that cyclist safety priorities change with inclusion of underreported, and lower severity collisions. The findings are particularly relevant to road infrastructural planners, as well as in the fields of injury biomechanics, and automated vehicle safety (ADAS). Representative scenarios for collisions with bonnet-type vehicles and single cyclist collisions have been identified, allowing for their future inclusion in development of collision and injury prevention strategies. The dataset generated in this study is available from the authors on reasonable request.}

abstract = {Background
An inadequate rest break between shifts may contribute to driver sleepiness. This study assessed whether extending the major rest break between shifts from 7-hours (Australian industry standard) to 11-hours, improved drivers’ sleep, alertness and naturalistic driving performance.
Methods
17 heavy vehicle drivers (16 male) were recruited to complete two conditions. Each condition comprised two 13-hour shifts, separated by either a 7- or 11-hour rest break. The initial 13-hour shift was the drivers’ regular work. The rest break and following 13-hour shift were simulated. The simulated shift included 5-hours of naturalistic driving with measures of subjective sleepiness, physiological alertness (ocular and electroencephalogram) and performance (steering and lane departures).
Results
13 drivers provided useable data. Total sleep during the rest break was greater in the 11-hour than the 7-hour condition (median hours [25th to 75th percentile] 6.59 [6.23, 7.23] vs. 5.07 [4.46, 5.38], p = 0.008). During the simulated shift subjective sleepiness was marginally better for the 11-hour condition (mean Karolinska Sleepiness Scale [95th CI] = 4.52 [3.98, 5.07] vs. 5.12 [4.56, 5.68], p = 0.009). During the drive, ocular and vehicle metrics were improved for the 11-hour condition (p<0.05). Contrary to expectations, mean lane departures p/hour were increased during the 11-hour condition (1.34 [−0.38,3.07] vs. 0.63 [−0.2,1.47], p = 0.027).
Conclusions
Extending the major rest between shifts substantially increases sleep duration and has a modest positive impact on driver alertness and performance. Future work should replicate the study in a larger sample size to improve generalisability and assess the impact of consecutive 7-hour major rest breaks.}

To evaluate advancements in the prevention of road traffic injuries (RTI) in Mexico in the context of the United Nation’s Decade of Action for Road Safety.
Methods
An analysis of the trend and age-period-cohort effects of RTI mortality from 1999 to 2018 was conducted. Mortality figures were age-standardized using the direct method and population estimates of 2018 as the standard. To evaluate whether advancements might be attributed to higher levels of death misclassification, we conducted sensitive analysis using multiple imputation to redistributed deaths allocated to non-specific ICD-10 codes. Non-fatal RTI from four nationally representative health surveys (2000, 2006, 2012 and 2018) were analyzed.
Findings
Implementation of Mexico’s National Road Safety Strategy 2011–2020 was associated with an average annual percentage change reduction in the age-standardized RTI mortality rate of 1.3% (95%-CI: −1.8,-0.9). Reductions are more evident in pedestrians and four + wheelers (−6.7% and −5.3%, respectively, from 2011 to 2018); mortality trend in motorcyclists increased from 1999 to 2018 an average of 12.8% annually (95%-CI: 9.9, 15.9). Potential underestimation of mortality due to death misclassification decreased from 22.7% in 1999 to 16.4% in 2018; sensitive analysis showed that reductions might not be attributed to death misclassification. Non-fatal injuries decreased in four + wheelers but increased in motorcyclists. The number of individuals suffering permanent consequences from RTI increased.
Conclusions
Results showed some potential gains of Mexico’s road safety strategies: RTI in four + wheelers decreased. Efforts should be put in place urgently to prevent the growing number of RTI in motorcyclists.}

The model was applied to data of lane change conflicts collected from 11 basic freeway segments in Guangdong Province, China. Block-level factors such as traffic volume per 10 min, number of lane change events per 10 min, and proportion of oversized vehicles per 10 min and site-level factors such as segment length, curvature, and grade were considered. Two types of Bayesian hierarchical extreme value models were developed, including models without site-level factors and models with site-level factors. These models were also compared to at-site models that were developed for 11 segments separately. The results show that Bayesian hierarchical extreme value models significantly outperform the at-site models in terms of crash estimation accuracy and precision. As well, including site-level factors further improves the model performance in terms of goodness-of-fit. This demonstrates the validity of the Bayesian hierarchical extreme value model. The results also show that number of lane change events, segment length, and grade are significant factors which have adverse effect on the safety of lane changes on freeway segments.}

abstract = {Mobile sensors are a useful data source with applications in several transportation fields. Though cost of collection, transmission, and storage has limited studies on driving data and safety, this can be overcome through usage-based insurance (UBI). In UBI programs, drivers are monitored, and their premiums are adjusted based on driver-level surrogate safety measures (SSMs) related to exposure and driving style. Contextual link-level SSMs (volume, speed, or density) could further improve discount calibration. This study quantifies relationships between contextual SSMs and crashes and includes the validation of previous results (correlations between SSMs and crashes and statistical models estimated using smartphone-collected data from Quebec City) and the comparison of three Canadian cities (using UBI data from Quebec City, Montreal, and Ottawa). Extracted SSMs were compared to large volumes of historical crash frequency data using Spearman’s Rank Correlation Coefficient and then implemented into spatial Bayesian crash models. Results from the UBI data generally matched those from the previous study, with observed correlations mirroring previous results in direction (braking, congestion, and speed variation are positively associated with crash frequency while mean speed is negatively associated) while correlation strength was slightly higher. Furthermore, these results were consistent between cities. For the crash modelling, repeatability of previous results in Quebec City was moderately good for the UBI data. Importantly for large-scale implementation, models estimated using UBI data were largely consistent between cities. This work provides an important contribution to the existing literature, clearly demonstrating how contextual safety measures could be applied to benefit UBI practices.}

abstract = {The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the impacts of traffic states on crash risk in the vicinities of Type A weaving segments. A deep convolutional embedded clustering (DCEC) was developed to classify traffic flow into nine states. The proposed DCEC outperformed the three common clustering algorithms, i.e. K-means, deep embedded clustering, and deep convolutional autoencoders clustering, in terms of silhouette coefficient and calinski-harabaz index on the same samples, suggesting that the DCEC provides better clustering performance. The characteristics of the nine traffic states are described for the right and inside lanes separately. The DCED visualization indicates that the spatiotemporal features of the nine traffic states are different from each other. The empirical analyses suggest that crash severity and the main types of crashes are different across the nine traffic states. The results of the logistic regression model prove that the nine traffic states are significantly associated with crash risk in the vicinities of weaving segments, and each traffic state can be assigned with a unique safety level. The convolutional neural network with gated convolutional layers (G-CNN) was developed to predict the crash risk in each traffic state. Compared with the traditional four traffic states classification based on 4-phase traffic theory, the model incorporating the various crash mechanisms across the nine traffic states provides more accurate predictions.}

But the consequences of introducing such automated vehicles (AVs) into current road traffic cannot be clearly foreseen yet, especially for pedestrian safety. The present study used virtual reality to examine the pedestrians’ crossing behavior in front of AVs as compared to conventional cars (CVs). Thirty young (ages 21–39) and 30 older (ages 68–81) adults participated in a simulated street-crossing experiment allowing for a real walk across an experimental two-way street. Participants had to cross (or not cross) in mixed traffic conditions where highly perceptible AVs always stopped to let them cross, while CVs did not brake to give them the right of way. Available time gap (from 1 to 5 s), approach speed (30 or 50 km/h), and the lane in which the cars were approaching (near and/or far lane of the two-way street) were varied. The results revealed a significantly higher propensity to cross the street, at shorter gaps, when AVs gave way to participants in the near lane while CVs were approaching in the far lane, leading to more collisions in this condition than in the others. These risky decisions were observed for both young and older participants, but much more so for the older ones. The results also indicated hesitation to cross in front of an AV in both lanes of the two-way street, with later initiations and longer crossing times, especially for the young participants and when the AVs were approaching at a short distance and braked suddenly. This study highlights the potential risks for pedestrians of introducing AVs into current road traffic, complicating the street-crossing task for young and older people alike. Future studies should look further into the role of repeated practice and trust in AVs. The design of these vehicles must also be addressed. Some practical recommendations are provided.}

As the AV’s presence on roadways continues to grow, its crash scenarios take on new importance for traffic safety. This study therefore obtained crash patterns using the United States Department of Transportation pre-crash scenario typology, and used statistical analysis to determine the differences between AV and conventional vehicle pre-crash scenarios. Analysis of 122 AV crashes and 2084 conventional vehicle crashes revealed 15 types of scenario for AVs and 26 for conventional vehicles. The two groups showed differences in type of scenario, and differed in the proportion of crashes when the scenario was the same. The most frequent AV pre-crash scenarios were rear-end collisions (52.46%) and lane change collisions (18.85%), with the proportion of AVs rear-ended by conventional vehicles occurring with a frequency 1.6 times that of conventional vehicles. An in-depth crash investigation was conducted of the characteristics and causes of four AV pre-crash scenarios, summarized from the perspectives of perception and path planning. The perception-reaction time (PRT) difference between AVs and human drivers, AV’s inaccurate identification of the intention of other vehicles to change lanes, and AV’s insufficient path planning combining time and space dimensions were found to be important causes for the AV crashes. By increasing understanding of the complex characteristics of AV pre-crash scenarios, this analysis will encourage cooperation with vehicle manufacturers and AV technology companies for further study of crash causation toward the goals of improved test scenario construction and optimization of the AV’s automated driving system (ADS).}

In a driving simulator study, two rating scales, the Scale of Criticality Assessment of driving situations from Neukum et al. (2008) and the Criticality Rating Scale, were tested on their validity to assess the subjective criticality of take-over situations. Besides, the subjective and behavioral changes over the repeated experience of take-over situations were investigated. Twenty-five participants experienced a set of five take-over situations with varying time-to-collisions (TTC) at the moment of the take-over request, twice. After each of the first five take-over situations, participants rated the criticality on one scale, after each of the second five situations on the other scale. Correlation coefficients between TTCs and criticality ratings for each scale were calculated. Also, the changes of subjective and behavioral measures over the trials were investigated. Correlation coefficients indicated a strong correlation between criticality ratings and TTCs. Hence, both scales are equally valid for the assessment of the criticality of take-over situations. The repeated experience of the take-over situations did not affect effort ratings, take-over times, or steering wheel positions. But brake input decreased with increasing practice, indicating a safer take-over behavior. Hence, results of studies with repeated experience of take-over situations are relatively valid as only brake behavior changed with increasing practice.}

Although these factors have been mentioned in the literature as key indicators influencing accident severity of buses/minibuses, there is currently no study that explored the complex mechanisms underpinning the simultaneous effect of pavement and light conditions on the generation of accident severity outcomes while considering weekly temporal stability of the accident-risk factors. This study seeks to investigate the variations in the effect of contributing factors on the severity of bus/minibus accidents in Ghana across various combinations of pavement and light conditions and to identify the exact effects of weekdays and weekends on severity outcomes using a random parameter ordered logit model with heterogeneity in the means to account for unobserved heterogeneity in the police-reported data. Preliminary analysis demonstrated that accident-risk factors used in the models were temporally unstable, warranting the division of the data into both weekend and weekday time-periods. A wide variety of factors such as sideswipes, median presence, merging, and overtaking had significantly varying effects on bus/minibus accident severities under different combinations of pavement and light conditions for both weekdays and weekends. Insights drawn from this study, together with the policy recommendations provided, can be employed by engineers and policymakers to improve traffic safety in developing nations.}

abstract = {Crashes involving cyclists and pedestrians in Europe cause the deaths of about 7600 persons every year. Both cyclists and pedestrians are especially exposed in crashes with motorized vehicles and collisions with trucks can lead to severe injury outcomes. The two most frequent crash scenarios between trucks and these vulnerable road users (VRU) are: a) when the truck wants to turn right at an intersection, with a cyclist riding parallel and planning to cross the intersection and b) when a pedestrian crosses in front of the truck in perpendicular direction to the movement of the truck. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)—that are expected to prevent or mitigate these crashes—benefit from detailed information about the behavior of truck drivers. This study is a first exploration of this research area, with the aim to assess how drivers negotiate the encounters with VRUs in the two scenarios described above. Thirteen participants drove an instrumented truck on a test-track. After some baseline recordings, the drivers experienced two laps where they encountered a cyclist target and a pedestrian target crossing their path. The results show that the truck drivers adapted their kinematic and visual behavior in the laps where the VRU targets were crossing the intersection, compared to the baseline laps. The speed profiles of the drivers diverged approximately 30 m from the intersection and glances were directed more often towards front right and right, during the scenario with the cyclist in comparison to baseline laps. For the scenario with the pedestrian crossing, the drivers changed their speed about 14 m from the intersection and glances were directed more often towards the front center, compared to baseline laps. As a result, both the speed and distance from the intersection at the end of the maneuver were significantly different between VRU and baseline laps. Overall, the findings provide valuable information for the design of ADAS that warn the drivers about the presence of a cyclist travelling in parallel direction or that intervene to avoid a collision with a cyclist or pedestrian.}

It comprises an extensive comparison between a wide array of statistical and machine learning models that were developed to estimate pedestrian and bike exposure. The results indicated that the XGBoost approach was the best to estimate vulnerable road users’ exposure at intersections as well as bike exposure along the roadway segments. Afterwards, the estimated exposure was utilized as input variables to develop crash prediction models that relate different crash types to potential explanatory variables. Negative Binomial approach was followed to develop crash prediction models to be consistent with the Highway Safety Manual. The results show that the exposure variables (i.e., AADT, bike exposure, and the interaction between them) have significant influences on the two types of crashes (i.e., crashes of vulnerable road users at intersections and bike crashes along the segments). Further, the results indicated that the context classification is significantly related to crashes. Based on the developed models, the PSIs were calculated and the hotspots were identified for the two crash types. It was found that hotspots were more likely to be located near the city of Orlando. Coastal roadways were classified as cold categories regarding bike crashes. Further, C4 roadway segments were found to be significantly related to the increase of vulnerable road users’ crashes at intersections and bike crashes along the segments.}

To describe nearness-to-collision, mostly time-based indicators are applied, and there is a consensus among researchers that speed-related indicators are needed to account for the severity dimension. There have been attempts to fit bivariate Extreme Value models to predict the number of crashes, however modeling crash frequency together with severity has received much less attention. The aim of this paper is to apply Extreme Value models to various pairs of temporal and speed-related indicators in order to investigate the dependence structure between them as well as to construct probability based risk levels and examine them in relation to severity levels. Bivariate threshold excess models were fitted to a dataset of left-turning and straight moving vehicle interactions recorded in a signalized intersection. The dependence structure between variable pairs were thoroughly investigated; it was concluded that temporal and speed related indicators were found independent, which means that road users getting close to each other in time does not necessarily come with high speeds. Therefore these indicators should be combined in order to properly predict severity; a temporal indicator on its own is not enough to make inferences about the severity of events. Using the calculated joint probability of events risk levels were constructed illustrating the events of equal probability.}

abstract = {Aim
In-vehicle telematics monitoring systems that provide driver feedback have been identified as a promising intervention to influence driver behaviours and reduce the growing burden of road injury. The current study was undertaken to assess the effect of driver feedback alone and feedback plus financial incentives on driving behaviours (speeding, hard acceleration and hard braking).
Method
A pragmatic randomised trial was undertaken over a 28-week observational period. Drivers were recruited and randomly allocated to one of three groups namely, driver feedback, driver feedback plus incentives and a control group. The feedback group received a weekly summary of their driving performance via SMS text message and access to more detailed feedback via an online dashboard or smartphone application. The feedback plus financial incentive group received the feedback but lost financial incentives for risky driving behaviour above a threshold.
Results
A total of 174 drivers completed at least one driving trip during the study period; 18,082 trip days completed by these 174 drivers during the study period provided the sample for analysis. For the primary outcomes of probability of speeding, hard acceleration and hard braking on any given trip, neither feedback alone nor feedback plus incentives delivered statistically significant improvements in driving behaviour relative to the controls. Treatment effects for feedback plus incentives were, however, consistently in the expected direction and large enough to warrant further investigation. For the secondary composite measure of risky driving, namely the DriveScore™, a statistically significant improvement was observed for the feedback and incentive group compared to the control group (TE = 2.6 points on a 0–100 scale, p < 0.05).
Discussion
This study adds to our understanding of the potential effects of feedback and financial incentives. Findings suggest that, while feedback alone may be insufficient to motivate behaviour change, combining feedback with financial incentives can deliver potentially important and statistically significant reductions in risky driving behaviours.}

The in-service guardrail performance was evaluated under impacts of multiple sized vehicles at Test Level 4 and Test Level 5 conditions specified in Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware (MASH). The effectiveness of the guardrails was assessed using guardrail dynamic deflections, vehicle responses, and vehicle redirection characteristics. The MASH exit box criterion, MASH evaluation criterion F (roll and pitch angle limit), and MASH evaluation criterion N (vehicle trajectory) were adopted in the evaluations. Additionally, occupant safety and injury risk were determined using occupant impact velocities (OIVs), occupant ridedown accelerations (ORAs), and acceleration severity indices (ASIs). The crash simulation results showed that both W-beam and Thrie-beam guardrails could retain all test vehicles and prevent them from getting into oncoming travel lanes. All the guardrails were considered generally effective in terms of occupant risk factors and vehicle impact responses. It was also observed that in certain cases, the installation height and the type of guardrail blockout could affect the impact severity for small-sized vehicles.}

A major concern for issuing an evacuation order is that it may involve a high number of crashes in highways. In this study, we present a matched case-control based approach to understand the factors contributing to the increase in the number of crashes during evacuation. We use traffic data for a period of 5 to 10 min just before the crash occurred. For each crash observation, traffic data are collected from two upstream and two downstream detectors of the crash location. We estimate models for three different conditions: regular period, evacuation period, and combining both evacuation and regular period data. Model results show that, if there exist a high volume of traffic at an upstream station and a high variation of speed at a downstream station, the likelihood of crash occurrence increases. Using a panel mixed binary logit model, we also estimate the effect of evacuation itself on crash risk and find that, after controlling for traffic characteristics, during evacuation the chance of a crash is higher than in a regular period. Our findings have implications for evacuation declarations and highlight the need for better traffic management strategies during evacuation. Future studies may develop advanced real-time crash prediction models which would allow us to deploy proactive countermeasures to reduce crash occurrences during evacuation.}

Because riders of two-wheelers (TWs) are among the most vulnerable road users, New Car Assessment Programs, like the China New Car Assessment Program (C-NCAP), have recently introduced test scenarios for the assessment of AEB for cars encountering TWs (TW-AEB). The main aim of this study was to determine how well two different C-NCAP test scenario datasets reflect real-world crash scenarios for the purpose of assessing TW-AEB performance. We used virtual counterfactual simulations to determine whether the hypothetical TW-AEB’s performance, when applied to the two C-NCAP datasets, was similar to its performance when applied to a set of reconstructed car-to-TW crashes representing real-world crashes. The test datasets were the current C-NCAP scenario set and a proposed C-NCAP scenario set; the real-world crash dataset comprised 113 reconstructed crashes from the Shanghai United Road Traffic Safety Scientific Research Center database (SHUFO). The performances were compared with respect to crash avoidance rate and the characteristics of the remaining crashes. A substantially higher proportion of crashes was avoided in the current C-NCAP scenario set than in the other two (with the sensor field of view (FoV) set to 70° and the activation time to 1.1 s TTC). In fact, with these parameter settings, no crashes remained in the current C-NCAP scenarios, while only 37% and 46% of the crashes in the proposed C-NCAP scenario set and SHUFO crash set were avoided, respectively. Our findings show that TW-AEB systems which are optimized for the current C-NCAP test scenarios are likely to provide benefits in real-world crashes. However, including additional test scenarios which reflect real-world crash situations more accurately would likely lead to a higher correlation between C-NCAP scores and real-world TW-AEB performance. In particular, we recommend the introduction of longitudinal same-direction scenarios with the car or TW turning and perpendicular scenarios with high TW traveling speed, in future C-NCAP releases. Inclusion of these scenarios in C-NCAP might reward improvements of future TW-AEBs toward systems that can save more lives. Furthermore, our study shows that there is likely to be a substantial number of crashes with an impact speed higher than 40 km/h still remaining even after the widespread application of TW-AEB. Therefore, passive safety for TW riders on Chinese roads will be still needed.}

abstract = {Sight distance is an important indicator of vehicle safety at intersections. Traditional intersection design methods might be not suitable for the autonomous vehicle (AV) because its perception differs from that of the human driver, on which AASHTO Greenbook 2018 are based. Since, to guarantee future operational safety, intersection design needs to consider the impact of the AV, this study investigates and quantifies the relationships between intersection angle on skewed intersections. The operational design domain (ODD) is defined as the required detecting angle and distance within the skewed intersection's speed range. Calculations for acute-side detecting angle, obtuse-side detecting angle, and obtuse-side detecting distance formulae were developed based on sine theorem and inverse trigonometric function; leg length of the sight triangle along an intersection’s major road was calculated by multiplying the design speed by the time gap. Calculation results show that the current design criteria cannot provide sufficient sight distance for the AV if the approach speed is not controlled. The AV’s higher approach speed, even when controlled, can improve both intersection safety and efficiency. The ODD requires different detecting angles and distances for the intersection angles of 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80 degrees. Intersection angle was found to have greater influence on the detecting angle when the road design speed was higher than 40 km/h, and the obtuse-side detecting distance increased rapidly when speed on the major road reached 50 km/h. For AV safety performance, engineers should incorporate the AV’s detecting angle, distance, and time gap into the skewed intersection design criteria. AVs technology needs to comply with the ODD defined by the intersection geometrics.}

abstract = {Importance
The management of traffic injuries is challenging for clinicians. Knowledge about predictors of nonrecovery from traffic injuries may help to improve patient care.
Objective
To develop a prediction model for self-reported overall nonrecovery from traffic injuries six months post-collision in adults with incident traffic injuries including post-traumatic headache (PTH).
Design
Inception cohort studies of adults with incident traffic injuries (including PTH) injured in traffic collisions between November 1997 and December 1999 in Saskatchewan, Canada; and between January 2004 and January 2005 in Sweden.
Methods
Prediction model development and geographical external validation.
Setting
The Saskatchewan cohort (development) was population-based (N = 4,162). The Swedish cohort (validation) (N = 379) were claimants from two insurance companies covering 20% of cars driven in Sweden in 2004.
Participants
All adults injured in traffic collisions who completed a baseline questionnaire within 30 days of collision. Excluded were those hospitalized > 2 days, lost consciousness > 30 min, or reported headache < 3/10 on the numerical rating scale. Follow-up rates for both cohorts were approximately 80%.
Predictors
Baseline sociodemographic, pre-injury, and injury factors.
Outcome
Self-reported nonrecovery from all injuries (not “all better (cured)” on the self-perceived recovery scale) six months after traffic collision.
Results
Both cohorts were predominantly female (69.8% in Saskatchewan, 65.2% in Sweden), with median ages 35.9 years (Saskatchewan), and 38.0 years (Sweden). Predictors were age, low back pain, symptoms in arms or hands, hearing problems, sleeping problems, pre-existing headache, and lower recovery expectations. With a positive score (i.e., ≥0.85 probability), the model can rule in the presence of self-reported nonrecovery from all injuries at six months (development: specificity = 91.3%, 95% CI 89.2%-93.0%; sensitivity = 27.8%, 95% CI 26.0%-29.7%; positive likelihood ratio (LR + ) = 3.2, 95% CI 2.5–4.0; negative likelihood ratio (LR-) = 0.79, 95% CI 0.76–0.82; validation: specificity = 72.6%, 95% CI 61.4%–81.5%; sensitivity = 60.5%, 95% CI 53.9%–66.7%); LR+ = 2.2, 95% CI 1.5–3.3; LR− = 0.5, 95% CI 0.4–0.7).
Conclusions and relevance
In adults with incident traffic injuries including PTH, predictors other than those related to baseline head and neck pain drive overall nonrecovery. Developing and testing interventions targeted at the modifiable predictors may help to improve outcomes for adults after traffic collision.}

Motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) are a leading cause of death among adolescents. Identifying factors that contribute to adolescent MVCs is a pressing public health need. Exogenous (cell phones, passengers, music) and endogenous (stress, worry, mind-wandering) forms of driver inattention account for approximately 78% of all MVCs in the United States. Though both exogenous and endogenous distraction contribute to crash risk, prior work investigating adolescent crash risk has largely focused on exogenous distractors. The Attention-Related Driving Errors Scale (ARDES) is a promising measure assessing individual differences in endogenous driver inattention that has been validated in adult drivers. Its validation in an adolescent sample may prove useful in tailoring future interventions to decrease MVC risk in young drivers.
Methods
This study sought to validate the ARDES in novice adolescent drivers by investigating its underlying factor structure and its relations with self-reported measures of daily inattention, performance-based attention assessments, and a self-report measure of driving behavior.
Results
Replicating earlier work in adults, results suggested ARDES items can be classified according to their operational level of the driving. The ARDES had good internal reliability and construct validity, suggesting it is a valid self-report measure of the propensity for adolescents' attentional errors while driving.
Discussion
The ARDES provides a useful tool for researchers to identify adolescents at greater risk of attentional errors while driving. Future research should use the ARDES to better understand the role of driver inattention in adolescent crash risk.}

abstract = {Background
The number of fatal pedestrian injuries in the United States has steadily increased over the past decade. Multiple factors likely contribute to this trend, but the growth of pedestrians distracted by mobile devices is widely hypothesized to play a major role. Existing strategies to reduce distracted pedestrian behavior are few and mostly ineffective. The present study evaluated StreetBit, a mostly-passive primary prevention program to reduce distracted pedestrian behavior by alerting distracted pedestrians directly on their smartphone when they approach an intersection, reminding them to attend to traffic as they crossed.
Methods
385 individuals who regularly crossed a target street corner at an urban university downloaded StreetBit on their phones and participated in a crossover design study whereby the app was inactive for 3 weeks (baseline behavior phase), actively provided alerts for 3 weeks (intervention phase), and then was inactive again for 4 weeks (post-intervention phase). User distraction while crossing the intersection was collected electronically for a total of 34,923 street-crossing events throughout the 10-week study.
Results
In crude (unadjusted) models, participant distraction was similar across all phases of the research; this result was maintained after adjusting for potential covariates as well as after conducting a sensitivity analysis limited to data from only week 3 of each study intervention phase. In a model stratified by phone/warning type and baseline distraction rates, Android phone users who received a warning that blocked the full screen and had a high baseline distraction rate (≥75% distracted crossings) had a 64% decreased odds of distraction during the alert phase (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.25–0.51) and a 52% decreased odds of distraction during the post-intervention phase (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.25–0.94). Users reported positive impressions about the StreetBit app in a post-intervention survey.
Discussion
StreetBit, an innovative app designed to prevent distracted pedestrian behavior through a mostly-passive primary prevention strategy relying on intrusive reminders, proved effective among smartphone users who received a warning blocking the full screen and who were frequently distracted at baseline, but not among other users. The results appear to reflect the confluence of two influencing factors. First, due to software development limitations, visually-distracted Android users received a highly intrusive app warning that blocked their smartphone screen whereas iOS users received a less intrusive banner notification blocking a small upper portion of the screen. Second, most users were curious to see if the app was functioning properly, creating artificially-inflated estimates of distraction as users purposefully watched their phones when crossing. Thus, our results indicate promise for StreetBit as an effective intervention and warrant continued software development and empirical testing.}

We develop a novel theoretical account, based on existing empirical research, of perceptual and psychological processes that may account for changes in speeding behavior under low traffic volume conditions. These include impaired ability to accurately perceive and control speed due to change in visual information, decreased salience of certain norms about socially appropriate speeds, lower perceived risk of speeding, and increased boredom leading to risk-taking behaviors. Further, we consider that individual attitude functions may account for the observed split in speeding behavior.}

This study investigated the underlying mechanisms for AV acceptance and how the mechanisms differed across subgroups by reviewing and synthesizing existing literature. We proposed AV acceptance models by extending the basic Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with trust and perceived risk factors. Data from 36 studies were extracted to fit the models using meta-analytic structural equation modeling technique. The results suggested that trust contributed most in determining AV acceptance, followed by perceived usefulness and perceived risk, and perceived ease of use makes the least contribution. The subgroup analyses showed that the model parameters differed across the levels of three variables, i.e., sample origin (Europe/Asia/America), automation level (full/partial), and age (young/middle-aged). Specifically, trust was unanimously identified as the most important determinant of AV acceptance across all subgroups. Perceived risk only remained significant in America, fully AVs, and middle-aged subgroups. Perceived ease of use was insignificant in the above-mentioned three subgroups while remained significant in the rest subgroups. Building trust could be the most useful and universal way to improve AV acceptance, and policy makers should consider the characteristics of consumers when making AV promotion strategies.}

Such crashes incur hazardous consequences on road users’ lives. Therefore, a correlated random parameters logit modeling framework was employed to investigate the influences of crash precursors on rollover risk to identify effective safety countermeasures. This approach was selected to account for both the crash contributing factors’ unobserved heterogeneity effects and the correlations among those effects. The data, used in this study, were those of single-truck crashes on Wyoming’s interstate curved sections. The traditional logit and uncorrelated random parameters, or mixed, logit models were attempted as well. With that, the analysis results indicated that the fit of the correlated random parameters logit model was superior to those of the others. It also revealed insights regarding correlations among random parameters that were obscure in the other models. According to its results, on average, veering off the road, overcorrections and severe winds raised the risk of single-truck rollover crashes. On the other hand, median barriers, roadside guardrails, tight horizontal curves, icy road surfaces, wet surfaces and surfaces covered by loose material, in general, reduced the likelihood of rollovers. Correlations, such as those between severe winds and icy surfaces and those between roadside guardrails and icy surfaces, were inferred as well. This study’s results will assist transportation officials in efficiently identifying appropriate countermeasures to mitigate the impact of truck rollovers particularly during adverse weather conditions.}

The means of the random-parameter distributions are typically used without explicit consideration of the variances. In this study, by virtue of the Taylor series expansion, we proposed a straightforward yet analytic solution to include both the means and variances of random parameters for unbiased prediction. We then theoretically quantified the systematic bias arising from the omission of the variances of random parameters. Our numerical experiment further demonstrated that simply using the means of random parameters to predict the number of crashes for out-of-sample observations is fundamentally incorrect, which necessarily results in the underprediction of crash counts. Given the widespread use and ongoing prevalence of the random-parameter approach in crash analysis, special caution should be taken to avoid this silent pitfall when applying it for predictive purposes.}

Due to the limited availability of safety data, municipalities tended to adopt SPFs from Highway Safety Manual or other neighboring jurisdictions. Recently, boosting algorithms have been frequently exploited for data analysis and statistical regression modeling problems. This research, therefore, aims to examine the efficiency of boosting calibration techniques to transfer the SPF using the limited region data in an international context. To this end, AdaBoost.R2, an adaptive boosting algorithm, Two-stage TrAdaBoost.R2, an instance-based transfer learning algorithm, and Gradient Boosting algorithm were employed to investigate their efficiencies in acquiring knowledge from the available source domain data to predict crashes in the target domain. As a comparison, the calibration factor method was adopted to transfer the traditional negative binomial (NB) regression model. Two training dataset groups were developed to train the four calibration techniques. The first group was used to examine the adaptability of the employed calibration techniques to the limited target region data. While the second group was utilized to further investigate the influence of larger vital information on the performance of transferred models. This study was conducted between two U.S. states, Florida and New York, and two Chinese cities, Shanghai and Suzhou. According to the goodness-of-fit results, boosting calibration techniques showed better prediction accuracy than the calibrated NB-based model using the limited target region data. In addition, the amount and distribution of the training dataset were considered the two significant factors that influence the proficiency of the boosting calibration techniques.}

However, it is unknown whether the SCEs risk can be predicted to inform driver decisions in the medium term (e.g., hours ahead) since the literature has focused on SCE predictions either for a given road segment or for automated breaking applications, i.e., immediately before the event. In this paper, we examine the SCE data generated from 20+ million miles-driven by 496 commercial truck drivers to address three main questions. First, whether SCEs can be predicted using disparate driving-related data sources. Second, if so, what the relative importance of the different predictors examined is. Third, whether the prediction models can be generalized to new drivers and future time periods. We show that SCEs can be predicted 30 min in advance, using machine learning techniques and dependent variables capturing the driver’s characteristics, weather conditions, and day/time categories, where an area under the curve (AUC) up to 76% can be achieved. Moreover, the predictive performance remains relatively stable when tested on new (i.e., not in the training set) drivers and a future two-month time period. Our results can inform dispatching and routing applications, and lead to the development of technological interventions to improve driver safety.}

Therefore, various experts focused their attention on issues related to drivers looking at their mobile phones; recently, researchers from different disciplines saw the need to deepen knowledge also on the phenomenon of vulnerable road users distracted by digital devices, especially when approaching signalized intersections. This study builds on and seeks to extend this area of research by analyzing the effects of digital distraction on pedestrians as they approach unsignalised intersections located on roundabout entrances and exits. The aim of the research is to understand the extent to which the task of checking social media affects pedestrian reaction and crossing times, as well as to identify which elements attract the most pedestrian attention. To achieve this goal, an eye-tracking study was designed, in which participants wearing eye-tracking glasses were asked to walk a predefined route, once checking their social media apps and once walking without distracting technological elements. The results showed an 84% increase in reaction time when using the phone, while only a slight rise in crossing time was found. The general conclusions about the most observed elements when walking are also consistent with the main findings of previous literature studies.}

They usually ride on the shoulder or on the right edge of the lane, sharing the infrastructure with motorised vehicles. Due to the speed difference between road users, the most frequent and dangerous interaction is in overtaking manoeuvres. One key factor from a safety and traffic operation point of view is the overtaking duration. The main aim of this paper is to analyse how factors related to the road, the cyclists, and the overtaking manoeuvre influence the duration of overtaking to cyclists on two-lane rural roads. Naturalistic field data were obtained using instrumented bicycles. Seven groups of cyclists, formed by different numbers of cyclists riding in-line and two-abreast, rode along five rural roads with different geometric and traffic characteristics. A total of 1592 flying manoeuvres, in which drivers did not reduce their speed, and 192 accelerative manoeuvres were analysed. The overtaking duration, considering each overtaking strategy, was modelled using Bayesian statistics. Results showed that flying manoeuvres were more prevalent than accelerative. They were performed with higher speeds and lower lateral clearances and, therefore, presented lower overtaking durations. For both overtaking strategies, duration increased on wider roads and with a larger size of the group. The presence of an oncoming vehicle decreased the overtaking duration. However, other factors presented opposite effects on the duration depending on the overtaking strategy. The developed predictive models allow obtaining overtaking durations varying road and cyclist grouping characteristics. Results can be used by road administration to manage and propose some specific countermeasures to integrate the cyclists in a safe and efficient way on two-lane rural roads.}

abstract = {Background
Alcohol consumption and psychoactive drug use are well-recognised risk factors for road traffic injuries (RTIs). Both types of use may impair and affect drivers' performance. Yet, there is limited literature on their contribution to RTIs among commercial motorcycle riders, particularly in low- and middle-income settings. This study aimed to determine the association between alcohol consumption, marijuana use and RTIs among commercial motorcycle riders in the city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
Methods
We conducted a case-control study between July 2018 and March 2019. Cases (n = 164) were commercial motorcycle riders who had sustained an RTIs and attended at a hospital. Controls (n = 400) were commercial motorcycle riders who had not experienced an RTIs that led to hospital attendance during the past six months. Alcohol consumption was assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification (AUDIT) score, which classified participants as a non-drinker, normal drinker(1–7 scores) and risky drinker (scores ≥ 8). Marijuana use was assessed through self-reported use in the past year. We estimated odds ratios (ORs) using logistic regression adjusted for sociodemographic, driver-, and work-related factors.
Results
Risky drinking was associated with close to six times the odds of RTIs compared to non-drinkers (OR = 5.98, 95% CI: 3.25 – 11.0). The association remained significant even after adjusting for sociodemographic, driving and work-related factors (OR = 2.41, 95% CI: 1.01 – 5.76). The crude odds ratios of RTIs were significantly higher among users of marijuana than non-users (OR = 2.33, 95% CI: 1.38 – 3.95). However, the association did not remain statistically significant after adjusting for confounders (OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 0.49–2.48).
Conclusion
Our findings confirm increased odds of RTIs among commercial motorcycle riders with risky drinking behaviour even after taking sociodemographic, driving and work-related factors into account. Unlike alcohol consumption the relationship between marijuana use and RTIs among commercial motorcycle riders was unclear. Since motorcycle riders are more susceptible to the effect of alcohol due to higher demands of balance and coordination and because commercial motorcyclist riders, in particular, they spend a considerable amount of time on the road, our results underscore the importance of addressing hazardous alcohol consumption and marijuana use in future prevention strategies to enhance road safety.}

These two modeling approaches were further compared to identify which of them provides the best fit for the data with respect to accounting for unobserved heterogeneity. A total of 2206 freeway crash incident data from January 1 to December 31, 2018 were examined in developing the models. The study was based on a unique dataset that involved merging and matching Traffic Incident Management response data from the Alabama Department of Transportation (ALDOT) Traffic Management Center (TMC), freeway crash data from the Center for Advanced Public Safety (CAPS) at the University of Alabama, Alabama Service and Assistance Patrol (ASAP) data from ALDOT and traffic volume from ALDOT’s Highway Performance Management System (HPMS). The model estimation results reveal that a total of nineteen variables were found statistically significant with five random variables (on-road, nighttime, rain, AADT, and ASAP existing coverage area) and fourteen fixed effects variables for the random parameters model. For latent class model, a total of eighteen variables were observed statistically significant within two distinct latent classes (Latent Class 1 with class membership probability of 0.23 and Latent Class 2 with class membership probability of 0.77) at a 0.05 significance level. A comparison of the two models reveals that the latent class model provides the better fit for the incident duration data. The findings of this study are expected to contribute to the body of knowledge on incident duration by employing two advanced econometric modeling methods and to inform statewide efforts in significantly reducing the duration of freeway incident clearance time. Moreover, this is to ensure that policy decisions that may arise from the findings of the study are sound and based on data-driven evidence.}

abstract = {Objective
While alcohol, marijuana, and nicotine are the most commonly used substances, there is limited research on the between- and within-person associations of their use and driving under the influence (DUI) and riding with an impaired driver (RWID). The current study utilized a burst design to assess how use and co-use of these substances is associated with DUI and RWID.
Methods
College student drinkers with past-year marijuana and/or nicotine use (N = 367) were assessed on two consecutive weekends for three semesters. Logistic regression compared students who only reported drinking to student drinkers who used marijuana, nicotine, or all three substances on likelihood to DUI and RWID. Multilevel logistic models assessed the associations of varied combinations of substances with the daily likelihood of DUI and RWID.
Results
Compared to students who only used alcohol, students who also reported marijuana use were more likely to DUI (OR = 5.44), and students who reported use of alcohol, nicotine and marijuana more likely to DUI (OR = 10.33) and RWID (OR = 10.22). Compared to occasions when only alcohol was used, DUI was more likely on marijuana only occasions (OR = 9.08), and RWID was more likely on alcohol and marijuana occasions (OR = 3.86). However, confidence intervals were wide for effects.
Discussion
Students reporting use of all 3 substances had higher overall risk of DUI and RWID indicating prevention efforts for DUI and RWID should include all substances. Implications for prevention and intervention strategies at the individual and environmental level are discussed.}

abstract = {To avoid crashes caused by driver error in avoiding obstacles, a driver-centered steering assist controller with an adaptive authority allocation system is proposed for cooperative control purposes. To begin with, a concept of space collision risk (SCR) is introduced creatively for assessing the vehicle’s safety status in which the relative distance and the relative angle between the vehicle and the obstacle are taken into consideration. Meanwhile, the SCR-based authority allocation system is addressed to allocate steering authorities between the human driver and the assist controller adaptively to reduce SCR to zero as soon as possible. After that, an autonomous steering controller based on the model predictive control (MPC) technique and the artificial potential field (APF) method, considering not only the vehicle stability constraints but also roads and obstacles constraints, is developed to aid the human driver when necessary. In the end, the proposed algorithm is simulated in the CarSim-Simulink co-simulation platform under a series of typical scenarios, which shows the feasibility and effectiveness of the presented shared steering control method.}

abstract = {Most existing Extreme Value Theory (EVT) models were developed based on the total number of conflicts or a single type of traffic conflict to estimate the corresponding frequency of crashes. Using the total number of conflicts to estimate the total number of crashes may make it difficult to diagnose safety problems as countermeasures are usually related to specific conflict/crash types. Single-type EVT models may help to better explain the mechanism of crash occurrence of a certain type, but they only reflect the partial safety of a road entity. Therefore, developing EVT models for multiple types of traffic conflicts would be more representative. However, one important issue in modeling various types of traffic conflicts is that there will be considerable correlation among various conflict types. The modeled crash prediction results would be biased if the conflict type correlation is not accounted for. This study proposes a multi-type Bayesian hierarchical extreme value modeling approach, which has four advantages: 1) integrates multiple types of traffic conflicts; 2) incorporates the influence of several covariates; 3) combines traffic conflicts from different sites; 4) accounts for the unobserved heterogeneity in conflict extremes. The proposed multi-type approach was applied to estimate rear-end crashes and side-impact crashes of left-turning vehicles based on their corresponding traffic conflicts observed from two signalized intersections in the city of Surrey, British Columbia. Both conflict types of left-turning vehicles were characterized by the same indicator time-to-collision (TTC). Overall, the results show that the standard errors of the multi-type model parameters are smaller than those of single-type models. Moreover, the multi-type model produces more accurate crash estimates than its corresponding single-type models. The more accurate crash estimates are probably attributed to the two-type model accounting for the conflict type correlation.}

The objective of this paper is to report the findings from the Global Burden of Disease study (GBD-2019) on road injuries in Mexico at a national and subnational scale from 1990 to 2019, and to assess the association between road injury burden and the socio-demographic index. Following the 2019 Global Burden of Disease study road injury mortality, premature mortality, the years lived with disability and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) are reported. While the number of deaths from road injuries increased between 1990 and 2019, the age-standardized mortality rates declined. Pedestrian road injuries and motor vehicle road injuries accounted for 8 of every 10 deaths from road injury in 2019. Road injury mortality and DALY rates decreased nationally, but stagnated since 2011. The road injury burden was higher for men in all age groups. Pedestrian and motor vehicle road injuries caused the highest DALY rate in both males and females. There was no significant association between the SDI and the road injury age-standardized DALY rates. This study presents a comprehensive report of road injury burden of disease in Mexico. Mexico continues to have an incomplete, fragmented and poorly enforced legislative framework, with a large diversity between its 32 states. Thus, an integrated legislative and juridical effort is needed to continue reducing the road injury disease burden, which is tailored for specific age groups, vulnerable road users and high-burden areas.}

Thus, road safety urgently needs to be significantly improved at the national level to reduce the number of road traffic accidents and costs associated with it. Understanding road users’ acceptance of road pricing regarding road safety improvement is crucial for safety-related investment programs. As such, this paper investigated the factors associated with public intention-to-pay (ITP) for road safety improvement in Pakistan. A structural equation model (SEM) was adopted to analyze the determinants of ITP according to the theory of planned behavior (TPB) combined with latent psychological variables that describe the personal characteristics and evaluations of different measures. Furthermore, the moderating effects of socioeconomic characteristics were also examined. A sample of 340 car drivers, interviewed at different locations of Peshawar, Pakistan, was used to test the model. Results of the SEM model indicated that Road Infrastructure Safety Perception and Perceived Behavioral Control have strong association with the ITP of car users’ for road safety improvement. Risk Perception, Attitude towards Traffic Safety Responsibility, Attitude, Perceived Fairness, and Perceived Effectiveness were also associated with ITP. Differential age and gender-related moderating effects were also observed. Findings from this study are expected to assist the decision-makers in the effective planning and implementation of road safety projects and related budget allocations.}

Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore the factors associated with CRS use. A total of 3768 parents participated in the survey, with a mean age of 33.94. Parents’ knowledge and attitude regarding CRS were fair, with the mean score of 3.07 and 3.33 out of 6, respectively, and only 22.8% of them used CRS for their child passengers. Children aged below 3 years, drivers owing expensive cars and wearing seatbelts, and parents with higher knowledge and attitude scores had greater likelihoods to use CRS. Moreover, trip frequency and distance were also significantly associated with CRS use. The findings indicate that the use rate of CRS is low in Shenzhen and parents have fair levels of knowledge and attitude regarding CRS use. Comprehensive public education programs and legislative interventions are urgently required to increase the use of CRS and ensure child passenger safety in Shenzhen}

On the contrary, there is huge public sentiment about the safety records of intercity buses in low- and middle-income countries given the increasing bus-involved road traffic crashes and high fatality rates. This study sought to model the injury severity of intercity bus transport in Ghana using the random parameters multinomial logit with heterogeneity in means and variances modelling technique to account for unobserved heterogeneity in the dataset. The dataset involves crash data from the 575 km long Accra-Kumasi-Sunyani-Gonokrom highway in Ghana. Four discrete crash outcome categories were considered in this study: fatal injury, hospitalized injury, minor injury, and no injury. The study observed that crashes involving pedestrians, unlicensed drivers, and drivers and passengers aged more than 60 years have a higher probability of sustaining fatal injuries. Also, speeding, wrong overtaking, careless driving and inexperienced drivers were associated with fatal injury outcomes on the highway. The incidence of intercity bus transport crashes involving larger buses and minibuses were also found to more likely result in fatalities. The probability of hospitalized injury increased for crashes that occurred in a village setting. Given these findings, the study proposed improvement of the road infrastructure, enforcing seatbelt availability and use in intercity buses, increased enforcement of the traffic rules and regulations to deter driver recklessness and speeding as well as improving the luminance of the highways. Additionally, apps that have features for customers to rate intercity bus operators, the quality of services provided, and also have the option to report reckless driving activities can be developed to promote safe and inclusive public transport in the country.}

In order to provide a more-in depth understanding of how to deter young drivers from this behaviour, this study developed and tested a model of the legal and non-legal factors that influence young driver’s intentional speeding behaviour (exceeding the speed limit by more than 10 km/hr). A prospective survey design was conducted to measure the impact of perceptions of legal factors (including classical deterrence and reconceptualised deterrence variables) and non-legal factors (including the variables of fear of physical loss, material loss and perceived social sanctions, as well as the perception that it is safe to engage in the behaviour without being involved in a crash) at time 1, on engagement in speeding behaviour at time 2, which occurred 3 months later. A total of 200 participants aged 17–25 years completed both surveys (Mean age = 20.44 years). Using structural equation modelling, a unique model combining classical and extended deterrence theory, as well as prominent non-legal factors was created, and the variables were able to explain 41% of the variance in speeding behaviour. A high perceived severity of the punishment, experiencing direct punishment avoidance and perceiving that it is safe to speed were significant direct predictors. Meanwhile, there were also numerous significant partially mediated relationships found for both legal and non-legal variables. These findings provide important implications for both the application of deterrence-based theories in road safety and for improving countermeasures to deter young drivers more effectively from engagement in speeding.}

The cyclist’s head kinematic responses including the head relative impact velocity, WAD (Wrap around distance) of head impact location and HIC15 (15 ms Head Injury Criterion) were collected from simulation results to make up a dataset for data mining. The decision tree models of cyclist’s head kinematic responses were then created from this dataset and verified accordingly. Based on simulated results obtained from decision tree models, it can be found as follows. 1. In the E-bike-to-car accidents, the average head impact relative velocity and WAD of head impact location are higher than those in the car-to-pedestrian accidents. 2. Increasing the initial impact velocity of car can increase the cyclist’s head relative impact velocity, WAD of head impact location, and HIC15. 3. The WAD of cyclist’s head impact location is also significantly affected by the initial impact angle between E-bike and car and body size of cyclist: the WAD of head impact location becomes higher with increasing initial impact angle between E-bike and car and body size of cyclist. 4. The effects of initial E-bike impact location on the WAD of cyclist’s head impact location is not significant when initial E-bike impact location is concentrated in the region of 0.25 m around the centerline of the car.}

However, an injured bicyclist may be incapable of making a phone call to the emergency center. In this study, we propose an online approach to classify bicycle crashes based on signals from an onboard inertial measurement unit (IMU), which can be used as a trigger function for an automatic emergency system. For this purpose, we define several bicycle crash features according to the kinematic properties of bicycle accidents. The input signals (variables) influencing the individual crash features are determined by the ANOVA method (analysis of variance). With the determined input signals, probabilistic models for each crash feature are trained on the base of logit models and 20,000 km naturalistic driving data including 20 real crashes. In addition, further crash and corner case data has been collected for the model training. A decision tree describing all probabilistic crash features is used to classify different kinematic events and crash scenarios. A series of driving tests with a crash-dummy and a crash-car are performed to verify the proposed crash classification approach, showing a sensitivity of 96.8%, a specificity of 99.6% and an accuracy of 99.5% of the trained model.}

These models are applied in several steps of the safety management process, including to screen the road network for opportunities to improve safety and to evaluate the performance of safety countermeasure deployments. The SPFs in the HSM are generally estimated using negative binomial regression modeling. In some instances, they are estimated using annual crash frequency and site-specific (e.g., traffic volume) data, while in other instances they are estimated using aggregate crash frequency and site-specific data. This paper explores the differences that result from estimating SPFs using aggregate versus disaggregate data using the same methods as those used to estimate the SPFs in the HSM. A synthetic dataset was first used to conduct these comparisons – these data were generated in a manner that is consistent with the properties of the negative binomial distribution. Then, an observational dataset from Pennsylvania was used to compare the SPFs from both aggregate and disaggregate data. The results show that SPFs estimated using the panel (disaggregate) data and aggregated data provide similar model coefficients, although some differences may sometimes arise. However, the overdispersion parameter obtained using each dataset can differ significantly. These differences result in systematic biases in calculations of expected crash frequency when Empirical Bayes adjustments are applied, which – as the paper demonstrates – could lead to different outcomes in a network screening exercise. Overall, these results reveal that aggregating crash data might result in biased SPF outputs and lead to inconsistent Empirical Bayes adjustments.}

abstract = {Objective
Daily cannabis users develop tolerance to some drug effects, but the extent to which this diminishes driving impairment is uncertain. This study compared the impact of acute cannabis use on driving performance in occasional and daily cannabis users using a driving simulator.
Methods
We used a within-subjects design to observe driving performance in adults age 25 to 45 years with different cannabis use histories. Eighty-five participants (43 males, 42 females) were included in the final analysis: 24 occasional users (1 to 2 times per week), 31 daily users and 30 non-users. A car-based driving simulator (MiniSim™, National Advanced Driving Simulator) was used to obtain two measures of driving performance, standard deviation of lateral placement (SDLP) and speed relative to posted speed limit, in simulated urban driving scenarios at baseline and 30 min after a 15 min ad libitum cannabis smoking period. Participants smoked self-supplied cannabis flower product (15% to 30% tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Blood samples were collected before and after smoking (30 min after the start of smoking). Non-users performed the same driving scenarios before and after an equivalent rest interval. Changes in driving performance were analyzed by repeated measures general linear models.
Results
Mean whole blood THC cannabinoids concentrations post smoking were use THC = 6.4 ± 5.6 ng/ml, THC-COOH = 10.9 ± 8.79 ng/mL for occasional users and THC = 36.4 ± 37.4 ng/mL, THC-COOH = 98.1 ± 90.6 ng/mL for daily users. On a scale of 0 to 100, the mean post-use score of subjective high was similar in occasional users and daily users (52.4 and 47.2, respectively). In covariate-adjusted analysis, occasional users had a significant increase in SDLP in the straight road segment from pre to post compared to non-users; non-users decreased by a mean of 1.1 cm (25.5 cm to 24.4 cm) while occasional users increased by a mean of 1.9 cm (21.7 cm to 23.6 cm; p = 0.02). Daily users also increased adjusted SDLP in straight road segments from baseline to post-use (23.2 cm to 25.0 cm), but the change relative to non-users was not statistically significant (p = 0.08). The standardized mean difference in unadjusted SDLP from baseline to post-use in the straight road segments comparing occasional users to non-users was 0.64 (95% CI 0.09 – 1.19), a statistically significant moderate increase. When occasional users were contrasted with daily users, the baseline to post changes in SDLP were not statistically significant. Daily users exhibited a mean decrease in baseline to post-use adjusted speed in straight road segments of 1.16 mph; a significant change compared to slight speed increases in the non-users and occasional users (p = 0.02 and p = 0.01, respectively).
Conclusion
We observed a decrement in driving performance assessed by SDLP after acute cannabis smoking that was statistically significant only in the occasional users in comparison to the nonusers. Direct contrasts between the occasional users and daily users in SDLP were not statistically significant. Daily users drove slower after cannabis use as compared to the occasional use group and non-users. The study results do not conclusively establish that occasional users exhibit more driving impairment than daily users when both smoke cannabis ad libitum.}

Among such models, random parameters with heterogeneity in means has recently provided better results and has become popular. However, this study illustrates a potential limitation regarding the use of these models without explicitly factoring for excessive zero crash observations. To address this potential limitation, a random parameters with heterogeneity in means and a Lindley distribution is introduced in this study to factor for the unobserved heterogeneity using additional variables as well as site-specific variation from excessive zero crash observations. Results showed that a Poisson model with random parameters and heterogeneity in means using a Lindley distribution outperformed multiple alternative state-of-the-art specifications in terms of fit as well as overall prediction ability. The analyses using the proposed modelling approach revealed factors likely to affect the likelihood of Head-on FSI crashes involving HVs in Queensland including volume, segment length, period of analysis, terrain type being rolling, curve (moderate/sharp/very sharp) longer than 50% of the corresponding segment length, rural single carriageway with high (>=100 kph) and medium (>=50 and <100 kph) speed limits, and urban single carriageway. Unobserved heterogeneity regarding the parameter for road curvature was explained using rolling terrain type as an explanatory variable. This study has explained variation in the means of random parameters for a road attribute using the effect of a geometric variable, in which several stakeholders are primarily interested.}

The effect of these lockdown measures on road safety remain to be fully understood, however preliminary data shows reductions in traffic volume and increases in risky driving behaviors. The objective of the present study is to compare self-reported risky driving behaviors (speeding, distracted driving, drinking and driving, and drugged driving) during the pandemic in Canada and the U.S. to determine what differences exist between these two countries. Data was collected using the Road Safety Monitor (RSM), an annual online public opinion survey that investigates key road safety issues, administered to a representative sample of N = 1,500 Canadian drivers and N = 1,501 U.S. drivers. Respondents were asked about the likelihood of engaging in risky driving during the pandemic as compared to before COVID-19. Results show the majority of respondents indicated their behavior did not change, and most positively, a small proportion reported they were less likely to engage in these risky driving behaviors. However, notable proportions indicated they were more likely to engage in risky driving behaviors during the pandemic, as compared to before COVID-19. Of those who indicated this, U.S. drivers had significantly higher percentages compared to their Canadian counterparts. Behaviors most often reported by this sub-section of drivers who admit to being more likely to engage in risky driving during the pandemic were speeding (7.6%) and drinking and driving (7.6%) in the U.S., and speeding (5.5%) and distracted driving (4.2%) in Canada. Logistic regression results confirm that country was a significant factor, as U.S. drivers had greater odds of reporting they were more likely to engage in these risky driving behaviors, with the exception of speeding. Age also had a significant effect, as increasing age was associated with lower odds of reporting that these risky driving behaviors were more likely during the pandemic. Conversely, sex did not have a significant effect. Overall, the current findings suggest that a small proportion of drivers reported being more likely to engage in risky driving behaviors and the pandemic may have led to changes in the profiles of those drivers engaging in risky driving behaviors during lockdown measures. These results have important implications for policies and can inform how to manage road safety during future lockdowns.}

Two years of intersection crash data from Connecticut were analyzed based on driver characteristics, highway and traffic attributes, environmental variables, vehicle and crash types. These elements were used as independent variables to explore the contributing factors to crash outcome. The likelihood ratio test highlights that the temporal instability exists in both injury severity and vehicle damage models. The model estimation results illustrate that the means of some random parameters are different among crashes. The correlation coefficients of random parameters verify that these random parameters are not always independent, and their correlations should be considered and accounted for in crash severity estimation models. The investigation and comparison between injury severity models and vehicle damage models verify that the injury severity and vehicle damage are highly correlated, and the effects of contributing factors on vehicle damage are consistent with the results of injury severity models. This finding demonstrates that vehicle damage can be used as a potential surrogate measure to injury severity when suffering from a low sample of severe injury crashes in crash severity prediction models. It is anticipated that this study can shed light on selecting appropriate statistical models in crash severity estimation, identifying intersection crash contributing factors, and help develop effective countermeasures to improve intersection safety.}

Developing such systems requires new insights in personalised pre-crash driver behaviour with respect to braking and steering to develop crash prevention strategies. Therefore, the current study utilises Strategic Highway Research Program 2 Naturalistic Driving Studies (SHRP2 NDS) data to investigate personalised steering and braking thresholds by examining the last stage of a crash sequence. More specifically, this paper carried out an in-depth examination of braking and steering manoeuvres observed in the final 30 s prior to safety critical events. Two algorithms were developed to extract braking and steering events by examining deceleration and yaw rate and another developed and applied to determine the sequence of the manoeuvres. Based on the analysis, thresholds for detecting emerging situations were recommended. The investigation of driver behaviour before the safety critical events, provides valuable insights into the transition from normal driving to safety critical scenarios. The results indicate that 20% of the drivers did not react to the impending event suggesting that they were not aware of the imminent safety critical situation. Future development of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) can focus on individual drivers’ needs with tailored activation thresholds. The developed algorithms can facilitate driver behaviour and safety analysis for NDS while the thresholds recommended could be exploited for the design of new driver support systems.}

First, by analysing quantitative data gathered from an online survey regarding smartphone laws, perceptions of punishment when breaking the law, and attitudes to both the law and fines, this study found younger drivers were less likely to understand the law around phone use while driving, even after direct or indirect experience with police. Additionally, the severity and impact of fines were perceived as more impactful and severe among younger drivers, women, and those on lower incomes, and the most common types of illegal use younger drivers engaged with were navigation, music applications, and hands-free calling, mostly facilitated through Bluetooth with their device placed out of sight. Consequently, focus groups were conducted with a subset of these younger drivers to explore these findings in more depth. It was revealed that smartphone laws were perceived to be ambiguous, at times unreasonable, and difficult to access conclusive information regarding the law or receive information throughout the Graduated Licencing Program. Additionally, of full licenced drivers breaking smartphone laws (n = 807), 61.7 percent never used a cradle. Among probationary drivers breaking the law (n = 209), 76.1 percent never used a cradle. This suggests rampant surreptitious illegal use. As such, younger drivers learning to drive are also learning methods to avoid punishment while breaking smartphone laws. This included not using a cradle and opting instead for Bluetooth connectivity or engaging in hand-held use, a choice that continued into Full Licensed driving. The severity of punishment was not common knowledge and was perceived to be incommensurate to the risks associated with certain types of use. In their opinion all of these factors reduced the legitimacy of the law. Addressing these factors with evidence-based countermeasures may increase compliance and road safety.}

abstract = {Crash safety of electric two-wheelers (ETWs) has been one of the most important safety issues in China due to their high proportion of involvement in traffic accidents. Automated Emergency Braking (AEB) systems have proven to be effective in reducing the number of fatalities and injuries in traffic accidents. Providing test scenarios is one of the fundamental tasks required for establishing a set of AEB test programs for ETWs. Compared to traditional in-depth accident data, accident data accompanied with video recordings provide more accurate accident information prior to a crash as both the traffic environment and the crash process can be observed from the video. In this study, a set of typical AEB test scenarios for ETWs was developed using accident data with video information. Video recordings of 630 car-to-ETW crashes in China from 2010 to 2021 were selected from the VRU Traffic Accident database with Video (VRU-TRAVi). A K-medoids11See Section 2.3 Cluster Analysis. cluster analysis was carried out based on variables including the collision time, visual obstruction, motion of the car and ETW before the collision, relative motion direction between the car and ETW, and the ETW type. The velocity information of cars and ETWs was also accounted for in each clustering scenario. Seven typical pre-crash scenarios were obtained, including five electric-scooter (E-scooter) scenarios (representing two scenarios where the ETWs are approaching the car from the left side, two scenarios where the ETWs are approaching the car in the same direction and another scenario where the ETWs are approaching the car in the opposite direction) and two electric-bike (E-bike) scenarios where the E-bikes are approaching the car in the perpendicular direction. Both E-bike scenarios are consistent with the E-scooter scenario except for the ETW type and velocity range; therefore, by combining the E-bike and E-scooter scenarios, five ETW scenarios were finally recommended as AEB test scenarios. By comparing with typical scenarios extracted based on the China In-Depth Accident Study (CIDAS) data and the China New Car Assessment Program (C-NCAP) test scenarios, the results show that future AEB test scenarios for ETWs should focus on scenarios with visual obstructions and scenarios where either the car or the ETW is turning, with a velocity range of 15–30 km/h for ETWs.}

Analyzing contributing factors that affect injury severity facilitates injury severity prediction and further application in developing countermeasures to guarantee VRUs safety. Recently, machine learning approaches have been introduced, in which analyses tend to be one-sided and may ignore important information. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a comprehensive analytic framework that employs a deep learning model referred to as the stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) to predict the injury severity of traffic accidents based on contributing factors. The essential idea of the method is to integrate various analyses into an analytical framework that performs corresponding data processing and analysis by different machine learning approaches. In the proposed method, first, we utilize a machine learning approach (i.e., Catboost) to analyze the importance and dependence of the contributing factors to injury severity and remove low correlation factors; second, according to the geographical information, we classify the data into different classes by utilizing a machine learning approach (i.e., k-means clustering); third, by employing high correlation factors, we employ an SSAE-based deep learning model to perform injury severity prediction in each data class. By experiments with a real-world traffic accident dataset, we demonstrated the effectiveness and applicability of the framework. Specifically, (1) the importance and dependence of contributing factors were obtained by CatBoost and the Shapley value, and (2) the SSAE-based deep learning model achieved the best performance compared to other baseline models. The proposed analytic framework can also be utilized for other accident data for severity or other risk indicator analyses involving VRUs safety.}

This paper develops safety-adjusted transportation efficiency to account for the negative outcomes in transportation including accidents, fatalities, injuries and property loss. We model the transportation efficiency under the data envelopment analysis (DEA) framework by treating the accident-related negative outcomes as undesirable outputs. Two DEA models, based on radial and non-radial structures respectively, are proposed for panel data. We apply the methods to 31 provinces in China over a 20-year horizon 1998–2017. We find that the evolution of China’s overall safety-adjusted transportation efficiency follows a U-shaped path: It deteriorated between 1998 and 2002, steadily improved from 2002 to 2012, and stabilized during 2012–2017. The majority of the provinces improved their safety-adjusted transportation efficiency from 1998 to 2017, except for one province that maintained the status quo and three provinces that experienced a decline in performance. Improvement analysis is carried out to identify gaps in accident-related factors that each province should close to attain best-practice. Further, we find strong evidence of unconditional β-convergence and σ-convergence in safety-adjusted transportation efficiency, indicating that the provinces with low initial efficiency generally grew more rapidly and the dispersion of provincial efficiency levels diminished. The main findings are substantially different from the regular transportation efficiency analysis that does not consider the accident-related undesirable factors. The safety-adjusted transportation efficiency can convey important information that the regular transportation efficiency fails to capture.}

The goal of this study was to investigate how pedestrians respond to different types of AHS. We conducted a mixed factor experiment with 106 college-age adults using a large-screen pedestrian simulator. The task for participants was to cross a stream of continuous traffic without colliding with a vehicle. There were four AHS treatment conditions that differed in the color (white or red) and timing of an icon projected on the roadway in front the participant as an AHS vehicle approached. Participants in the treatment conditions encountered a mix of AHS and non-AHS vehicles. There was also a control condition in which participants encountered only non-AHS vehicles. We found that the color and the timing of the icon projected on the roadway influenced the size of the gaps crossed. Participants in the red icon with early onset condition chose the largest gaps for crossing. An unexpected outcome was that participants in the AHS treatment conditions chose larger gaps even when crossing in front of non-AHS vehicles, suggesting that experiences with AHS vehicles generalized to non-AHS vehicles. We conclude that AHS can have a significant, positive impact on pedestrian road-crossing safety.}

We note that the prominence of hazards and the importance of recognizing them vary systematically across single vs. multi-vehicle crashes, and address a fundamental question about safety: why do around three-quarters of drivers involved in single-vehicle crashes not recognize, perceive, or react to the precipitating event (PE)? Using a path-analytic framework through marginal effects, this study investigates factors correlated to recognition of the PE in single-vehicle events, and how these correlations may act as crash precursors. Logit models, accounting for heterogeneity among events and drivers by estimating both fixed and random parameters, quantified correlations among key variables, given a crash or near-crash event (N = 543). The type of PE, roadway environment factors, and driving maneuvers heavily influenced recognition chances. Drivers had a harder time recognizing less conspicuous hazards (e.g. departing the travel way, decreased recognition chances by 48.29%), but seemed better at recognizing prominent hazards (e.g. vehicle losing control, increased recognition chances by 46.71%). In addition, drivers are less likely to recognize PEs when executing less involved driving maneuvers in more relaxed environments, such as daylight (decreased recognition chances by 16.00%), but are more adept in environments that already demand more attention. Recognition reduced the chances of a crash by 12.23%, so we found similar correlations with crash outcome. Future intelligent transportation systems may focus on increasing driver recognition of potential hazards by bringing attention to less conspicuous hazards and less involved driving environments and actions.}

Most of the previous studies conducted experiments on real-time crash prediction of expressways or freeways, based on traffic flow data. However, the influence of risky driving behavior on traffic crash risk prediction has rarely been considered. Thus, a traffic crash risk prediction model based on risky driving behavior and traffic flow has been developed. The data employed in this research were captured using the in-vehicle AutoNavigator software. A random forest to select variables with strong impacts on crashes and the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) to adjust the imbalanced dataset were included in the research. A logistic regression model was developed to predict the risk of traffic crash and to interpret its relationship with traffic flow and risky driving behavior characteristics. This model accurately predicted 84.48% of the crashes, while its false alarm rate remained as low as 9.75%, which indicated that this traffic crash risk prediction model had high accuracy. By analyzing the relationship between traffic flow, risky driving behavior, and crashes through partial dependency plots (PDPs), the impact of traffic flow and risky driving behavior variables on certain traffic crashes in the prediction model were determined. Through this study, the data of traffic flow and risky driving behavior could be used to assess the traffic crash risk on freeways and lay a foundation for traffic safety management.}

The current study collected five years (2014–2018) of fatal crash data with additional details of pedestrian crash typing. This dataset provides specifics of scenarios associated with fatal pedestrian crashes. This study applied associated rules mining on four sub-groups, which were determined based on the highest frequencies of fatal crash scenarios. This study also developed the top 20 rules for all four sub-groups and used ‘a priori’ algorithm with ‘lift’ as a performance measure. Some of the key variable categories such as dark with lighting condition, vehicle going straight, vehicle turning, local municipality streets, pedestrian age range from 45 years and above are frequently presented in the developed rules. The patterns of the rules differ by the pedestrian’s position within and outside of crosswalk area. If the pedestrian is outside the crosswalk area, no lighting at dark is associated with high number of crashes. As lift provides quantitative measures in the form of the likelihood, the rules can be transferred into data-driven decision making. The findings of the current study can be used by safety engineers and planners to improve pedestrian safety at intersections.}

A notable increase in the percentage of PTW accidents resulting in fatalities has raised a serious need for further research in understanding riding behavior. The Motorcycle rider behavior questionnaire (MRBQ) based studies have shown promising results by using MRBQ to relate riding behavior with crash risk. Despite numerous studies using the MRBQ technique and inconsistency in derived inferences across the studies highlighted the need to revise MRBQ and carry out predictive validity for capturing the correct riding behavior of Indian riders. Therefore, this research modified the previously available questionnaire by considering the focus group's opinion, consisting of twenty professional riders, two transportation experts, and two traffic police officers. Additionally, the predictive validity check of MRBQ was carried out using a sample of Indian riders consisting of 392 participants. The exploratory factor analysis of the MRBQ revealed a 32 item version of the questionnaire divided into a four-factor structure (traffic errors, control errors, speed violations, and stunts). The present research highlighted some critical dissimilarities between PTW riders of India and other countries. The low mean score (based on the Likert scale) of the items under the four-factor structure indicated overall a safe PTW rider behavior of Indian riders. Among the four factors, speed violation showed the highest mean score and stunts showed the least mean score indicating frequent and infrequent aberrant ridding behaviors, respectively. A known group construct validity check revealed that gender had a significant and age an insignificant effect on the reporting of aberrant riding behaviors. Furthermore, a negative binomial regression analysis revealed that traffic error had the highest incidence rate ratio, confirming it to be the most significant predictor of crash risk for Indian riders. Finally, the study briefly discussed counter-measure strategies targeting specific riding behavior.}

abstract = {Speeding is one of the major contributing factors to traffic fatalities. Various speed management strategies have been proposed to encourage drivers to select more appropriate speeds. This study aims to explore the different effects of the speed management strategies on the speeding proportions at urban and suburban arterials. Probe speed data was used to calculate the speeding proportions. To overcome the variability of probe speed data caused by the signalized intersections, a new method was suggested to calculate the speeding proportion, and a fractional split model was estimated to adjust the probe speed data. A Beta regression model was developed to analyze the speeding proportion. A grouped random parameter modeling structure was adopted to realize the different effects of speed management strategies and other road attributes on speeding proportions by different road types. Besides, a fixed beta model was developed for the comparison. The results suggested the grouped random parameter model could provide better performance over the counterpart and could realize the different effects of road features and other contributing factors on the speeding of different roads. It is expected that the findings could help inform more appropriate road design in order to reduce speed limit violations on urban and suburban arterials.}

The present study investigates whether the effects of driver distraction are short-lived, or rather persist for some time. Age-related differences are evaluated as well. Sixty-three young and 61 older adults were tested in a driving simulator. They were asked to follow a lead car that drove at a constant speed, and to concurrently engage in a pseudorandom sequence of distracting tasks (typing, reasoning, memorizing). When the lead car braked, participants had to brake as well to prevent a collision. The stimulus onset asynchrony between the braking task and the last preceding distraction was 11.49 ± 1.99 s. Each person was tested once in a multitasking condition (as described above), and once in a control condition without distracting tasks. Outcome measures quantified distance keeping and lane keeping while participants braked to the lead car. We found that braking responses differed significantly between conditions; this difference could be interpreted as a combination of performance deficits and compensatory strategies in the multitasking condition compared to the control condition. We also found significant differences between age groups, which could be interpreted similarly. Differences between age groups were less pronounced in the multitasking than in the control condition. All observed effects were associated with participants’ executive functioning. Our findings confirm that distractions have an impact on braking responses, and they document for the first time that this impact can persist for about 11.5 s. We attribute this persistence to a task set effect, and discuss the practical relevance of our findings.}

Validity is a fundamental property of SMoS that describes how well they reflect the quality of interest – traffic safety. However, typical validation studies are extremely resource demanding. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore a relative approach to validity that uses fewer resources and does not rely on crash records from the observed locations. The core idea of a relative approach to the validation of SMoS is that while SMoS might not accurately estimate the expected number of crashes, they still work well for comparisons between different sites or between conditions at the same site. Based on this concept, we propose a method in which a ground truth based on literature can be used as a baseline that can then be compared to the safety analysis of an SMoS study. Using the proposed method, a case study of six intersections in northern Europe was conducted, focusing on bicycle infrastructure. The results indicate that the minimum time-to-collision indicator is in line with the ground truth, whereas the post-encroachment time indicator is not.}

Prior research suggests that driver behavior is a crucial factor in the majority of road crashes and is a significant factor influencing fuel consumption and vehicle emission. Significant improvement in driving behavior can be achieved by providing feedback to drivers about their driving behavior. An increasing interest among researchers to identify risky and non-economical driving maneuvers has led to the development of driver behavior profiling, i.e., rating/categorizing drivers into different categories based on how they drive. To get an insight into different parameters and methodology adopted by researchers for categorizing drivers into different categories, this paper presents a systematic review of studies on driver behavior profiling. In the present paper, PRISMA approach was adopted to shortlist the most relevant studies for systematic review out of 1231 initial studies, which were extracted using the relevant keywords. The findings from our study suggest that the selection of parameters for profiling the driver will depend on the application of the profiling scheme, type of device used for extracting data, and importance of parameter in rating criteria. Further, the findings suggest that significant improvement in driving behavior can be achieved by providing feedback to the drivers about their driving behavior and by implementing usage-based insurance schemes. It is also suggested that future studies shall focus on using smartphone devices for the collection of driver data as smartphones are nowadays easily accessible to everyone.}

Similarly, single-bicycle crashes and their costs to society are under-recognized by the public. The aim of this study was to conduct an analysis of single-bicycle crashes occurring in a cohort of cyclists in Denmark and supplement it with estimation of some attributable costs of single-bicycle crashes among all injured cyclists during one year treated in a hospital or emergency room in Denmark. We conducted a one-year follow-up of 6,793 active cyclists (mean age: 45.8 years) encountering 349 single-bicycle crashes (single-bicycle crash rate: 55 per 1,000 person-years). An in-depth analysis of the crashes suggested that daily winter road maintenance is crucial in colder climates and that the current cyclist infrastructure design gives rise to many single-bicycle crashes. Further analysis of the co-occurrence of the factors contributing to the crashes indicated that when the weather is warmer, the factors pertaining to the individual cyclist (and not the road authorities) dominate. The risk of sustaining a more severe injury (i.e. other than light bruises) once in a single-bicycle crash was 18 %. However, for cyclists above 50 years, this risk doubled compared with their younger counterparts, wholly due to a 4.7 times higher risk during the warm season. Among cyclists treated in hospital or emergency room, we estimated the attributable hospital cost of single-bicycle crashes at €1,701 and the attributable cost of municipality care at €417 in the first year after the injury (2019 prices). In cyclists aged 18–60 years and treated in hospital or emergency room, the estimated attributable risk of sickness benefit was 5.2 percentage points in the first year after the injury. We concluded that to increase cyclist safety, the road authorities should improve winter road maintenance and redesign cyclist infrastructure.}

This study aimed to produce risk curves that relate travel speed to the risk of serious injury in light vehicle impacts in order to contribute to the process of selecting acceptable travel speeds. Serious injury was defined in this study as any injury having a maximum abbreviated injury scale (MAIS) of three or greater, or a fatal injury (MAIS3+F). In the context of a crash, travel speed is defined as the vehicle's speed before the driver reacts to the crash situation. Travel speed was determined by selecting the highest pre-impact speed recorded by an Event Data Recorder (EDR) in the seconds before the crash. A total of 1,618 light vehicle impacts were analysed using logistic regression. Individual risk curves were produced for front, head on, side, rear and single vehicle impacts. The analysis found significant positive relationships between the risk of serious injury and travel speed for all of these impact types. The travel speeds at which the risk of serious injury reached one per cent were 63 km/h across all impacts, 17 km/h for head on impacts, 48 km/h for single vehicle impacts, 58 km/h for side impacts, 81 km/h for front impacts and 96 km/h for rear impacts. These results have implications for the setting of speed limits and other measures that influence the speed at which vehicles travel.}

However, limited studies have developed microsimulation models for the safety evaluation of active road users such as pedestrians. This can be attributed to the limited ability of simulation models to capture the heterogeneity in pedestrian behavior and their complex collision avoidance mechanisms. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop an agent-based framework to realistically model pedestrian behavior in near misses and to improve the understanding of pedestrian evasive action mechanisms in interactions with vehicles. Pedestrian-vehicle conflicts are modeled using the Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework. A continuous Gaussian Process Inverse Reinforcement Learning (GP-IRL) approach is implemented to retrieve pedestrians’ reward functions and infer their collision avoidance mechanisms in conflict situations. Video data from a congested intersection in Shanghai, China is used as a case study. Trajectories of pedestrians and vehicles involved in traffic conflicts were extracted with computer vision algorithms. A Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model is used to estimate optimal pedestrian policies in traffic conflicts. Results show that the developed model predicted pedestrian trajectories and their evasive action mechanisms (i.e., swerving maneuver and speed changing) in conflict situations with high accuracy. As well, the model provided predictions of the post encroachment time (PET) conflict indicator that strongly correlated with the corresponding values of the field-measured conflicts. This study is a crucial step in developing a safety-oriented microsimulation tool for pedestrians in mixed traffic conditions.}

Using vehicle crash (N = 3,700) and non-traffic crime (N = 605,052) data from 2016 to 2018, hot spots of these two sets of events and their overlap were identified. Crash hot spots captured 14% of the crashes in only 0.5% of Stockholm’s area while crime hot spots captured 27% of the recorded offences in less than 1% of the area. There was overlap in these hot spots for 7% of the crashes and 10% of the crimes. To model predictors, the events were allocated to roadway segments (N = 5511) and tested using a Poisson-Gamma-CAR spatial regression model. Both crashes and crimes exhibit a clear center-periphery pattern that varies over time and by type of crashes and crimes. Crashes tended to occur on roadways with higher average daily traffic (ADT) while crimes tend to occur on roadways with lower ADT with around half occurring on residential streets. Both types of incidents tended to be higher in lower income neighborhoods. Land uses common to both types of harm were the location of underground stations, ATM machines, and alcohol-serving businesses. These are places where people and cars converge at particular times. The effect of these events on police, emergency, and medical services is discussed.}

However, few have analyzed spatio-temporal changes and influential factors over more than 10 years, despite dramatic changes in the built environment during such time spans. Here, we examine big data on pedestrian-related crashes in Seoul from 2009 to 2018 using a space-time cube methodology and binary logistic regression analysis. The results show that the trend in pedestrians killed or severely injured is decreasing with pedestrian environment enhancement projects and pedestrian safety measures in Seoul. Also, the analysis reveals a need to pay more attention to pedestrian safety in areas with a large older population. Pedestrian safety measures should be reinforced in areas of concentrated wholesale and retail businesses. This study also indicates that illegal parking poses a threat to pedestrian safety. Lastly, this study confirms some positive impacts of redeveloped or newly developed areas and pedestrian environment enhancement projects on pedestrian safety.}

abstract = {An innovative approach for real-time road safety analysis is presented in this work. Unlike traditional real-time crash prediction models (RTCPMs), in which crash data are used in the training phase, a real-time conflict prediction model (RTConfPM) is proposed. This model can be trained using surrogate measures of safety, and can therefore be applied even in situations in which highly spatial/temporal-accurate crash data are unavailable or unreliable. The application of an RTConfPM consists of using a set of input variables recorded during a given time interval, to predict whether there will be an increased risk of unsafe situations in the following interval. This paper presents an RTConfPM to predict rear-end crashes, using time-to-collision values recorded with radar sensors on multiple motorway cross-sections to define unsafe situations, and traffic conditions recorded on the same sections as input to the model. The RTConfPM is compared to a traditional RTCPM, trained with a dataset of crashes located on the same motorway, and using the same traffic data as input. In both approaches, variable selection is performed with Pearson’s correlation test and random forest; synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) is used to balance the classes in the training dataset, support vector machine (SVM) is used as classifier, and Monte Carlo cross-validation is adopted for robustness. The two approaches are evaluated considering accuracy, recall, specificity/false alarm rate, and area under the curve (AUC). As shown by the results of this paper, the conflict-based approach appears promising, and is able to predict the occurrence of unsafe situations within 5 min with more than 93% accuracy, recall and specificity, significantly outperforming the RTCPM.}

abstract = {Individual collision types have different underlying causes and thus the relationships between roadway/traffic characteristics and crash frequency are likely to differ across unique collision types. One way these different influences have been studied is by developing separate statistical models for each collision type. While this is the most straightforward approach, developing collision-specific models can be very tedious and can produce unreliable estimates for collision types that are less frequently observed. Moreover, ignoring correlations between different collision types may result in biased and inefficient parameter estimation. To overcome these limitations, researchers have adopted a multivariate approach that explicitly accounts for the correlation among individual collision types. As an alternative to multivariate approach, two-stage approaches have been proposed in which one model is estimated to predict total crash frequency and its prediction is combined with another model, used to predict the proportions of different collision types. More efficient one-stage joint models, in which both the frequency and proportion models are estimated simultaneously and predictions are provided more directly, have also been proposed for macro-level analysis. This study investigates the performance of this joint model paradigm in analyzing unique collision type frequencies on individual road segments. For this, a joint negative binomial-multinomial fractional split (NB-MFS) model is used. Moreover, this study also proposes the use of a multinomial logit (MNL) model to estimate the proportion of different collision types. As total crash frequency NB model and MNL model utilize different datasets, a two-stage estimation process is required, which leads to the two-stage NB-MNL model proposed here. The performance of proposed model is compared with that of collision-specific NB models, multivariate negative binomial (MVNB) model, and NB-MFS model in predicting crash frequency by collision type on two-way two-lane urban-suburban collector roadway segments in Pennsylvania. The goodness of fit statistics show that the NB-MNL model performs better than collision-specific NB models, MVNB model and joint NB-MFS model and is thus a promising approach in predicting crash frequency by collision type.}

This is a growing problem in the United Sates where bicyclist and pedestrian fatalities have increased steadily since 2009. A large body of research suggests vehicle speeds are a key contributing factor for crashes. However, few studies of bicycle or pedestrian crash probability incorporate detailed vehicle speed data. This study uses probe vehicle speed data to examine the impact of vehicle speeds on bicycle and pedestrian crashes on the state of Georgia’s network of major arterial roadways. The analysis examines 7000 road segments throughout the state in 2017. A Negative Binomial model relates annual crash and speed data on each segment. Models using speed percentiles (85th, 50th and 15th) are contrasted with models using speed differences (85th–50th and 50th–15th percentile). A small set of covariates are included: segment length, number of lanes, Average Annual Daily Traffic, and urbanicity. Results indicate that larger differences in high-end speed percentiles are positively associated with bicycle and pedestrian crash frequency on Georgia arterials. Furthermore, the coefficients on the high end of the speed distribution, measured by the difference in 85th and 50th percentile speeds, have greater magnitude and statistical significance than the low end of the distribution. This research shows a negative relationship between speed and crashes may be flawed, as it does not account for the distributions of speed. The findings in this study suggest that planners and engineers should identify areas with large speed distributions, especially at the high vehicle speeds, and work to reduce the fastest speeds on these roadways. To do so, differences in speed percentiles measured using probe vehicle speeds can be used to determine where high risk areas are located.}

The results showed that the Mexican version of the DATQ replied the original five-factor structure, maintaining the 65 items likewise in both the Spanish and Romanian versions. Analyses of the invariance suggested the equivalence among the three versions, especially in the case of Mexican-Spanish. Moreover, the five factors were positive and mostly significantly related to each other, and with both risky driving and aggressive driving. Some significant relationships were attained also with crash-related events, especially in the case of those which happened in the last three months (short-termed). Finally, males showed higher scores than females in the five ways of aggressive thinking. Limitations of the study, practical implications and future research are discussed.}

Therefore, the current study investigates the influence of a reclined sitting position on crash injury severity by analyzing real-world crash data from the German in-depth accident study (GIDAS). We compared reclined to upright occupants and focused on effect sizes regarding odds ratios at different injury severity levels. We used the abbreviated injury scale (AIS 2015) for injury scaling and the maximum AIS (MAIS) at the levels 2+, 3+, and 4+ to convert injury severity into a dichotomous metric. Two different analyses were conducted, one looking at the occupant MAIS and one focusing on selected body regions. The body regions investigated are head/face/neck (HFN), thorax, abdomen, pelvis/hip/lower extremities (PHL), and upper extremities. We computed odds ratios greater than one indicating a higher odds of injury at a given injury severity level in the reclined group compared to the upright group. The odds ratios for belted, reclined occupants compared to belted, upright sitting occupants are 2.07, 3.09, and 3.66 for the injury severity levels MAIS2+, MAIS3+, and MAIS4+, respectively. When looking at the body regions, the spread of the odds ratios is wider: At the MAIS2+ level, the odds ratios range between 1.6 and 7.1; at the MAIS3+ level, the odds ratios span from 1.5 to 8.7, with the latter value representing the PHL region. No odds ratio could be computed for the upper extremity injuries at this level. At the MAIS4+ injury severity level, only the HFN odds ratio was statistically significant with a value of 5.6. This study is among the first to show an association between body posture and injury severity at MAIS3+ and MAIS4+ injury level in real-world crashes for reclined seating postures.}

abstract = {Previous research into perceptions of autonomous vehicles has largely focused on a priori attitudes, with little work on the perception of specific traffic situations, context and driving styles. The present study used three simulator experiments (total N = 150) to examine the combined effects of vehicle speed, lane position, information presentation and traffic context on occupants’ levels of satisfaction with autonomous highway journeys. Overall, occupants preferred being in a vehicle that was mostly overtaking compared to being overtaken, regardless of whether the overtaking vehicles were exceeding the speed limit. This finding remained even when occupants were given additional reminders that they themselves were travelling at an appropriate speed (Experiments 1 \& 2). Experiment 3 found that occupants preferred overtaking to being overtaken when following another car, but this preference disappeared when they were following a lorry, suggesting that occupants’ sensitivity to position amongst the traffic was partially context dependent. Overall, the findings suggest that journey satisfaction is sensitive to overtaking contexts and the inappropriate behaviour of other drivers (e.g., speeding) can reduce journey satisfaction for occupants in autonomous vehicles that drive within the speed limit, depending on the specific traffic situation. Potential implications for the integration of autonomous vehicles with other traffic and the need for in-vehicle presentation of information are discussed.}

abstract = {Objective
We present a model for visual behavior that can simulate the glance pattern observed around driver-initiated, non-critical disengagements of Tesla’s Autopilot (AP) in naturalistic highway driving.
Background
Drivers may become inattentive when using partially-automated driving systems. The safety effects associated with inattention are unknown until we have a quantitative reference on how visual behavior changes with automation.
Methods
The model is based on glance data from 290 human initiated AP disengagement epochs. Glance duration and transition were modelled with Bayesian Generalized Linear Mixed models.
Results
The model replicates the observed glance pattern across drivers. The model’s components show that off-road glances were longer with AP active than without and that their frequency characteristics changed. Driving-related off-road glances were less frequent with AP active than in manual driving, while non-driving related glances to the down/center-stack areas were the most frequent and the longest (22% of the glances exceeded 2 s). Little difference was found in on-road glance duration.
Conclusion
Visual behavior patterns change before and after AP disengagement. Before disengagement, drivers looked less on road and focused more on non-driving related areas compared to after the transition to manual driving. The higher proportion of off-road glances before disengagement to manual driving were not compensated by longer glances ahead.
Application
The model can be used as a reference for safety assessment or to formulate design targets for driver management systems.}

abstract = {Introduction
Mental fatigue has been shown to negatively affect motor and sport performance. To date, however, no research focused on assessing the effects of mental fatigue on hazard perception in young cyclists who are highly vulnerable in traffic, especially after school. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the influence of induced mental fatigue on hazard perception and anticipation in young cyclists using a novel Virtual Reality bicycle simulator.
Methods
In this randomised, counterbalanced, cross-over investigation, forty-eight young cyclists cycled through a Virtual Environment (VE) in which they were confronted with eight simple and six complex traffic situations. Simple traffic situations are considered events including only one other actor can cause a dangerous situation while complex traffic situations include multiple actors than contribute to the dangerous situation. Half of the children were mentally fatigued using the Stroop colour-word task while the other half immediately started the VR hazard perception test. On the second test occasion, one month later, the other half of the group was mentally fatigued.
Results
The results demonstrate that mentally fatigued cyclists fixated the relevant areas of interest (AOIs) in the simple and complex later and showed delayed response times for the complex hazards. Mental fatigue, however, did not alter the speed with which participants cycled through the virtual environment and did not change the hazard perception score.
Conclusion
To our knowledge, this was the first study to investigate the effect of mental fatigue in young cyclists with an innovative VR hazard perception simulator. Due to increased mental fatigue, young cyclists might have experienced more episodes of fatigue-related mind-wandering and a deterioration of selective attention for the task at hand. This resulted in a less thorough visual inspection of the scene and delayed braking responses.}

A compelling user experience is crucial to AV adoption in the future commercial market. The automated driving system (ADS) that replaces human drivers should be perceived as very useful before the latter are willing to give up their control and entrust their lives to the ADS. However, compared with the growing number of studies on public acceptance of AVs, there has been limited research focusing on user experience and usability. We examined AV and ADS user experience and usability, ADS failures’ influence on them, and their influences on re-riding willingness. We conducted a field study using a real AV and a large-scale test track. We invited participants (N = 261) to travel in the AV as passengers in a low-speed environment. Participants were randomly assigned into the normal condition or the fault condition (its participants were exposed to an ADS failure). We measured participants’ positive experience (feeling relaxed, safe, and comfortable) and negative experience (feeling tense and risky) while riding in the AV and perceived usability of the ADS based on the System Usability Scale. In both conditions, participants reported moderate positive experience and perceived usability but a relatively high level of willingness to ride in our AV again. The ADS failure reduced positive experience and perceived usability, and it increased negative experience. Positive experience and perceived usability, but not negative experience, influenced re-riding willingness. Compared with male participants, female participants reported less positive experience and lower perceived usability. We discuss implications of our results as well as limitations of this research.}

abstract = {We previously found that a six-session online hazard perception training course, which incorporates evidence-based learning strategies and footage of over a hundred real crashes, improved hazard perception skill and reduced risk-taking intentions in novice drivers who had passed their on-road driving test within the previous three years. However, one issue with targeting crash-prevention training at individuals who are already driving unsupervised is that drivers are at their highest crash risk immediately after they pass their on-road driving test. That is, the training may arrive too late to protect drivers while they are at their most vulnerable. It is also possible that it may prove difficult to persuade drivers to complete an unsupervised training course if they are already licensed to drive independently. Given that learner drivers cannot drive unsupervised, and that they are typically supervised by a parent, one potential strategy is to target the training at learners and to ask their parents to provide one-on-one mentoring throughout the course. We therefore recruited learner driver/parent-supervisor dyads to participate in a randomized control study, with the objective of examining the effects of the hazard perception training course on aspects of driving behaviour associated with crash risk (as measured using validated computer-based tests). Outcome measures included two hazard perception skill assessments (a response time hazard perception test and a verbal response hazard prediction test), and three tests assessing aspects of risk-taking propensity in driving (speed choice, following distance, and gap acceptance). Learners who completed the course (N = 26) significantly improved their scores on both hazard perception skill measures, and also chose safer following distances, compared with a waitlist control group (N = 23). However, the training did not significantly reduce learners’ speed choice or gap acceptance propensity. The hazard perception skill of parent-supervisors, who observed the course but did not complete it, also improved on both hazard perception measures, relative to controls. Additionally, both learners and their parent-supervisors reported a range of positive effects on the learners’ real-world driving performance. These results suggest that this type of hazard perception training could be beneficial if deployed during the learner phase of driver licensing.}

The results of the fog zone imply that drivers have a high degree of compliance with the connected vehicle technology. However, it also increases the visual workload of drivers to a certain extent. The results of the tunnel zone indicate that the connected vehicle technology can enhance driving safety by enabling drivers to remain cautious. The results of the work zone demonstrate that the connected vehicle technology is able to promote drivers’ ability of controlling speed and lane-changing. Overall, the results show that the connected vehicle technology has a positive effect on enhancing driving behavior and safety. The research framework and the development of the connected vehicle technology test platform based on the driving simulator given in the paper are dynamic and reproducible, which provides a reference for researchers in related fields, and the case analysis in this paper enriches the research of connected vehicle technology.}

An online survey is conducted to capture the impacts of Pokémon GO regarding: (i) perceived risk of using the app and opinion of prohibiting its usage while driving and cycling, (ii) frequency of app-related distracted driving and cycling, (iii) frequency of app-induced driving and potentially unsafe driving behavior, (iv) average daily steps before and after using the app, and (v) perceived physical and mental health benefits. Multivariate binary probit models and random parameters ordered probit models were estimated to capture users’ and non-users’ characteristics that affect these perceptions, attitude, and behavior. The results suggest that LAR gaming apps can potentially promote physical activity by encouraging people to walk more, increase social interactions such as app-related discussions, but also contribute to increased app-related distracted driving and cycling, app-induced driving, and unsafe driving behavior. The study findings and insights can provide valuable feedback to legislators and LAR gaming app developers for designing policies and app mechanisms that can address the safety concerns of using such apps, and provide physical and mental health benefits to its users.}

The DPMs are collected under various controlled driving conditions to demonstrate different driving behaviors so that mitigating technology interventions can be studied and designed. However, significant costs are involved in the DPM acquisition, and there are a very limited number of controlled driving condition data. Thus, the modeling and prediction of the DPMs under unobserved driving conditions are critical, and many methods have been developed. However, existing literature in this area suffer a common limitation: The interactions among different DPMs are not fully considered (each DPM is modeled individually), although the existence of such interactions is widely reported. This paper proposes a novel DPM modeling and prediction method, i.e., multi-output convolutional Gaussian process (MCGP), that incorporates the interactions among different DPMs. The method features the modeling flexibility for different DPMs and the interpretable modeling structure for integrating the DPM interactions. The method is compared with three benchmark methods on the DPM data set under four different settings, and the results demonstrate the superiorities of the method. Discussions and interpretations of the results are also provided.}

abstract = {Highway exit gore areas are common and essential components of highway networks everywhere. Drivers need to navigate, decelerate, and change lanes at exit gore areas through specified and compacted geometry. This makes exit gore areas potentially crash-prone locations. Studies analyzed factors contributing to crashes at exit gore areas. Although marking and delineation techniques can play a major role in enhancing safety, traffic control devices that serve this end were not given sufficient attention in recent research. Furthermore, the currently used marking and delineation treatments are widely different around the world and deploy devices of various forms, shapes, sizes, and colors. The Flemish Agency for Roads \& Traffic (AWV) launched a study to explore the feasibility of adding colored and sizeable eye-catching objects, mounted or grounded exactly at the physical nose, to attract driver's attention and improve driving performance. The eye-tracking and driving behavior of 49 Belgian drivers was investigated in a driving simulator. Participants were also queried about the conspicuity of the control devices and their personal preferences. The results were univocal for situations including a guardrail. Using two mounted panels together, i.e., the horizontal and the vertical, scored better on all levels than the horizontal panel alone. The bigger surface size of the traffic control device significantly improved driving performance and was also favored by the participants. Situations without a guardrail lacked such clear results, which were mixed depending on the measure at hand. A larger size of a grounded object-marker, again, improved driver's performance. Findings concerning the colors red or green appeared to favor red, although this was less univocal. These findings are aimed to spark ideas for further research and to assist practitioners and policy-makers in better designing exit gore areas while achieving more consistency and safety.}

abstract = {It is well known that pedestrians are vulnerable road users. Their risk of being injured or killed in road traffic crashes is even higher as vehicle drivers often violate traffic rules and do not slow down or yield in front of crosswalks. In order to reduce this risk, many countries have issued strict regulations requiring vehicles to yield to pedestrians in front of crosswalks. While extensive literature exists on the interaction between vehicles and pedestrians, the consideration of heterogeneity in the behavior of vehicles is vastly overlooked. Accordingly, this study analyzes the yielding behavior of three types of vehicles under the “pedestrian priority” policy by processing drone footage collected in Xi'an City (China) with a Machine Vision Intelligent Algorithm. Moreover, this study proposes four additional indicators to the widely used yielding rate and yielding delay with the aim of evaluating yielding behavior of three types of vehicles. The results show that buses have the best yielding behavior from the perspective of yielding rate, yielding delay, waiting time, yielding angle and waiting site. Buses perform well in observing pedestrian dynamics near crosswalk, and perform exceptionally well in considering the “blind area” of vision. The location of the waiting site in front of the stop line and the length of the waiting time contribute to the safe crossing of pedestrians. In contrast, private cars perform badly in yielding to pedestrians. However, serious polarization can be observed across private cars, as the performance varies across the board. The relaxation of the homogenization assumption of the behavior of vehicles in pedestrian-vehicle interaction, alongside the improvements in the analysis via Machine Vision Intelligent Algorithm of videos acquired via drone, shows the possibility of having a deeper understanding of the yielding behavior of vehicles at crosswalk. The extension of the use of artificial intelligence methods to analyze drone footage has immense potential in understanding road user behavior and hence providing knowledge for crash prevention.}

Annual YLLs data due to traffic deaths from 2002 to 2019 in China were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019. After implementation of the revised law, the average level of total YLLs per 100,000 population due to traffic deaths decreased from 1133.14 to 848.87, and the slope of annual YLLs per 100,000 population decreased by 30.11 (95% CI: 22.46, 37.75), indicating a steeper downward trend. The revised traffic law was associated with YLLs reduction due to traffic deaths for males, females, all age groups, pedestrians, motor vehicle users, and other road users, as well as traffic deaths attributed to alcohol use and tobacco use. These findings suggested that the revised Road Traffic Safety Law improved road safety by decreasing YLLs due to traffic deaths in China.

Three hundred seventy-nine young drivers filled a questionnaire including the Driving Anger Scale, Bem Sex Roles Inventory, Driving Anger Expression Inventory, and demographic information. Moderated regression analyses showed that masculine gender role and anger provoked by other road users’ discourtesy were positively and femininity negatively related to verbal aggression while driving. Anger related to police presence, slow driving, and masculine gender role were positively related to gesture-based and vehicle-based expression of driver aggression. Hostility and feminine gender role were negatively related to the gesture-based expression of driver aggression, while anger related to witnessing illegal driving and feminine gender role were negatively related to the vehicle-based expression of aggression. The interaction effects between masculinity and hostility, masculinity and slow driving, and femininity and illegal driving were also found on the gesture-based expression of driver aggression. The effects of interaction between masculinity and slow driving and femininity and illegal driving were also found on the vehicle-based expression of driver aggression. Slow driving and femininity had a positive relationship to the adaptive expression of anger in driving. The results suggest that masculinity and femininity moderate the relationship between driving anger and the expression of driving anger among young drivers.}

To provide more insights into near-crash behavior, this study classified near-crash events into two severity levels: trivial near-crash events (-7.5 g ≤ deceleration rate ≤ -4.5 g) and non-trivial near-crash events (≤-7.5 g). From the perspective of descriptive statistics, the frequency of the itemsets, a set of categories of various variables, generated by the Apriori algorithm suggests that near-crash events are highly associated with several factors, including roadways without access control, driving during non-peak hours, roadways without a shoulder or a median, roadways with the minor arterial functional class, and roadways with a speed limit between 30 and 60 mph. By comparing the frequency of the occurrence of the itemset during trivial and non-trivial near-crash events, the results indicate that the length of the trip is a strong indicator of the near-crash event type. The results show that non-trivial near-crash events are more likely to occur if the trip is longer than 2 h. After applying the association rule mining algorithm, more interesting patterns for the two near-crash events were generated through the rules. The main findings include: 1) trivial near-crash events are more likely to occur on roadways without a median and shoulder that have a relatively lower functional class; 2) relatively higher functional roadways with relatively wide medians and shoulders could be an intriguing combination for non-trivial near-crash events; 3) non-trivial near-crash events often occur on long trips (more than 2 h); 4) congestion on roadways that have a lower functional class is a dominant rule associating with the high frequency of non-trivial near-crash events. This study associates near-crash events and the corresponding road geometry and trip features to provide a unique understanding of near-crash events.}

Using a rating system for injury severity level from minor injury to severe injury and to fatal injury, a wide range of potential risk factors are considered, including rider characteristics and actions, roadway characteristics, environmental and temporal characteristics, and crash characteristics. The findings indicate that, although some factors are significant in both urban and rural models, factors such as male rider, illegally overtaking, drowsiness, four-lane or wider highway, flush or depressed median, road on slope, weekend, nighttime with light, crash with van or minibus, and rear-ending or sideswiping crash, are significant only in the rural model, whereas the factors barrier median, occurring between 18:00 and 23:59, and striking a passenger car are statistically significant in only the urban model. These findings further suggests that difference in effect of unobserved characteristics could be seen in different crash locations, and splitting the model estimation between both location types could be done to develop effective guidance for policies to mitigate the severity of motorcyclist injuries. In addition, practical policy-related recommendations drawn from the results of the analysis are provided. With respect to methodology, the proposed CRPOPHM method outperforms lower-ordered models in terms of statistical fit and captures unobserved heterogeneity to a greater extent.}

The rate of usual as well as harsh acceleration epochs are used to extract insights on driving risk and driver comfort preferences. However, an analysis of acceleration rates at multiple thresholds incorporating various effects while using a large-scale and diverse dataset is missing. This analysis will fill this research gap. Data from the 2nd Strategic Highway Research Program Naturalistic Driving Study (SHRP2 NDS) was used for this analysis. The rate of occurrence of acceleration epochs was modeled using negative binomial distribution based generalized linear mixed effect models. Roadway speed category, driver age, driver gender, vehicle class, and location were used as the fixed effects and the driver identifier was used as the random effect. Incidence rate ratios were then calculated to compare subcategories of each fixed effect. Roadway speed category has the strongest effect on longitudinal and lateral accelerations of all magnitudes. Acceleration epoch rates consistently decrease as the roadway speed category increases. The difference in the rates depends on the threshold and is up to three orders of magnitude. Driver age is another significant factor with clear trends for longitudinal and lateral acceleration epochs. Younger and older drivers experience higher rates of longitudinal accelerations and decelerations. However, the rate of lateral accelerations consistently decreases with age. Vehicle class also has a significant effect on the rate of harsh accelerations with minivans consistently experiencing lower rates.}

While most states have enacted various traffic laws to address this phenomenon, little consensus exists on the causal impact of these laws in reducing alcohol-induced fatalities. This paper exploits quasi-random variation in state-level laws to estimate the causal effect of alcohol-related traffic laws on the frequency of fatal accidents. This is identified from the discontinuities in traffic laws among contiguous counties that are separated by a shared state border. We present robust evidence that the conventional approaches that are typically utilized in the literature may erroneously estimate the effectiveness of several alcohol-related laws.}

Current research tries to go further and compares driving styles with their analogous living styles to analyze both convergence and divergence in both safe and unsafe driving styles. Then, dissociative driving style was linked with general dissociation experiences, risky driving style with general sensation seeking, angry driving style with a general anger trait, anxious driving style with an anxiety trait, distress-reduction driving style with control of aggression, and careful driving style with conscientiousness. A sample of 228 participants taken from the general population of Spanish drivers completed a set of questionnaires regarding both driving styles and living styles. The hierarchical linear regression models showed both convergence and divergence in the case of unsafe driving styles, whereas safe driving styles were not so strongly related to their respective general behaviors (especially in the case of the distress-reduction driving style). A final structural equation model (SEM) simultaneously analyzed the relationship between driving styles and living styles. Both clinical and road-safety implications of the current study are discussed, as well as its limitations.}

They are promoted with numerous benefits such as increased safety yielding less RTAs, less congestion, less greenhouse gas emissions, and the possibility of enabling non-driving related tasks (NDRTs). However, there has been no study which has investigated different NDRT conditions, while comparing participants who experienced a severe RTA in the past with those who experienced no RTA. Therefore, we conducted a driving simulator study (N = 53) and compared two NDRT conditions (i.e., auditory-speech (ASD) vs. heads-up display (HUD)) and an accident (26 participants) with a non-accident group (27; between-subjects design). Although our results did not reveal any interaction effect, and no group difference between the accident and the non-accident group on NDRT, take-over request (TOR), and driving performance, we uncovered for both groups better performances for the HUD condition, whereas a lower cognitive workload was reported for the ASD condition. Nevertheless, there was no difference for technology trust between the two conditions. Albeit we observed higher self-ratings of PTSD symptoms for the accident than for the non-accident group, there were no group differences on depression and psychological resilience self-ratings. We conclude that severe RTA experiences do not undermine NDRT, TOR, and driving performance in a SAE Level 3 driving simulator study, although PTSD symptoms after an RTA may affect the psychological wellbeing.}

This included truck-involved crashes based on single and multi-vehicles, rural and urban locations, time of day variations, roadway classification, lighting, and weather conditions. However, analyzing commercial truck driver injury severity based on truck configuration is still missing. This paper aims to fill this knowledge gap by undertaking an extensive assessment of truck driver injury severity in truck-involved crashes based on various truck configurations (i.e. single-unit truck with two or more axles, single-unit truck pulling a trailer, semi-trailer/tractor, and double trailer/tractor) using ten years (2007–2016) of Wyoming crash data through hierarchical Bayesian random intercept approach. The log-likelihood ratio tests were conducted to justify that separate models by various truck configurations are warranted. The results obtained from the individual models demonstrate considerable differences among the four truck configuration models. The age, gender, and residency of the truck driver, multi-vehicles involvement, license restriction, runoff road, work zones, presence of junctions, and median type were found to have significantly different impacts on the driver injury severity. These differences in both the combination and the magnitude of the impact of variables justified the importance of examining truck driver injury severity for different truck configuration types. With the incorporation of the random intercept in the modeling procedure, the analysis found a strong presence (24%–42%) of intra-crash correlation (effects of the common crash-specific unobserved factors) in driver injury severity within the same crash. Finally, based on the findings of this study, several potential countermeasures are suggested.}

However, the high cost associated with testing is a serious obstacle in collecting large amounts of experimental data. This paper presents a methodology that can improve the reliability of results from experimental studies with a limited number of participants by creating a virtual population. Specifically, a methodology based on Bayesian inference has been developed, that generates synthetic cases that adhere to various real-world constraints and represent possible variations of the observed experimental data. The application of the framework is illustrated using data collected during a test-track experiment where truck drivers performed a right turn maneuver, with and without a cyclist crossing the intersection. The results show that, based on the speed profiles of the dataset and physical constraints, the methodology can produce synthetic speed profiles during braking that mimic the original curves but extend to other realistic braking patterns that were not directly observed. The models obtained from the proposed methodology have applications for the design of active safety systems and automated driving, demonstrating thereby that the developed framework has great promise for the automotive industry.}

Results show the emergence of four profiles of drivers: Respectful, Aggressive-Avenger, Aggressive-Dominant, and Aggressive-Situational. The difference between these clusters has been confirmed by the high tendency of anger disorders for Aggressive-Dominant, low tendency of aggressive driving for Respectful, high tendency for motives for aggressive driving as altruistic protection for Aggressive-Avenger, and high tendency of speeding for Aggressive-Situational.

The chosen time period contained normal operations, as well as the period of the first COVID-19-induced lockdown period in Greece. Three different Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) time series models were implemented in order to compare the observed measurements to forecasted values that were intended to depict assumed conditions; namely, without the appearance of the COVID-19 pandemic. Modelling results revealed that the total number of road collisions, fatalities, and slightly injured were decreased, mainly due to the sharp traffic volume decrease. However, the percentage reduction of the collision variables and traffic volume were found to be disproportionate, which probably indicates that more collisions occurred with regard to the prevailing traffic volume. An additional finding is that fatalities and slightly injured rates were significantly increased during the lockdown period and the subsequent month. Overall, it can be concluded that a worse performance was identified in terms of road safety. Since subsequent waves of COVID-19 cases and other pandemics may reappear in the future, the outcomes of the current study may be exploited for the improvement of road safety from local authorities and policymakers.}

The study builds upon existing approaches to symbolically deliver Traffic Control Devices (TCDs), specifically speed alerts, at different locations within the vehicle to reduce cognitive distraction and prevent visual crowding so that drivers can properly select their speed and focus upon the roadway environment. Twenty-three participants received five visual treatments (e.g., combinations of speed alert style, presentation, and location) in a simulated environment. Participants also responded to a set of survey questions following the simulated drive. Participants were evaluated on various response factors to each visual treatment. Results showed that younger participants of the age group 18–23 responded to the visual treatment and stayed within speed limits as compared to other older and more experienced participants. Results also showed that alerts falling in the mid-peripheral visual region and alerts that flashed received an increased response rate for observing speed limits.}

The purpose of this study is: First, to explore safety-related differences between youth choosing the L17 or the L18 option, with a particular focus on safety attitude and self-assessed driving skills. Second, to map patterns in the use of accompanied driving and its predictors as well as the interaction between the L17 driver and the accompanying person (ACP). A sample of 632 drivers (53% male) between 17 and 19 years of age completed a survey. Among the participants 61% licensed through L17 and 39% through L18. Our results identify different risk profiles between L17 and L18. A higher score on perceptual-motor skills, lower score on safety skills and lower support to speed limits predicted L17. Female L17 were more safety-oriented compared to male L17. L17 who had experienced a supportive atmosphere and engagement in complex traffic situations during the drive were more likely to indicate that accompanied driving had improved their driving skills. However, results also indicate that the amount of experience obtained by L17 may be insufficient to obtain a safety benefit. Measures to address speeding and other risk-taking behaviours among male candidate drivers are needed to ensure a safety benefit of the Danish accompanied driving scheme. In addition, requirements may be needed to increase the amount of accompanied driving. Finally, parent guidelines could support the creation of a positive atmosphere during the drive.}

The COVID-19 pandemic significantly altered people’s daily lives, including driving. However, how state Divisions of Motor Vehicles (DMV) adapted their operation policies in response to COVID-19 remains unknown. This study analyzed adaptations to the content of state DMV operation policies during the COVID-19 pandemic across 50 US states and assessed the relationships between these policy adoptions and their state-level COVID-19 restriction orders.
Methods
We merged data on policy adaptations due to COVID-19 obtained from DMV websites for all 50 states with data on state-level restrictions obtained from the National Academy for State Health Policy (NASHP). We created a codebook and analyzed the DMV policy adaptations in the following three areas: (1) road testing, (2) licensure extension and renewals, and (3) facility reopening. Two trained coders independently reviewed and coded the adaptations of policy content related to precaution to spread of COVID-19 and ease of obtaining licensure. We calculated summary scores for policy adaptations and ease of licensure and compared these scores across three categories of state-level COVID-19 restrictions using ANOVA.
Results
DMVs in all 50 states adapted their policies to slow the spread of COVID-19. The ease of licensure summary scores increased in some states but decreased in others. Extensions for licensure renewals was the most common change. Adoption of COVID-19 precautions during the road test was the most common road test adaptation, while road test waivers were the most controversial. Requiring appointments, social distancing, and/or face coverings/personal protective equipment [PPE] were common adaptations during facility reopening. However, variations in level of policy adaptations and ease of licensure were not associated with the state’s COVID-19 restrictions.
Conclusions
Our findings provide insight into policy adaptations made by state DMVs to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and may inform future policy adaptations in DMVs and other government agencies during public health emergencies.}

The proportional effect on motorcyclist deaths tends to be smaller or even have the opposite sign, especially in countries that are not highly dependent on motorcycles. For the US, a positive effect of gasoline prices on motorcyclist deaths is found, with an elasticity of about 0.3.

Based on about 9 h video data collected by an unmanned aerial vehicle from six unsignalized crosswalks of a roundabout, consecutive conflicts were identified, and an integrated severity index that combines post encroachment time, jerk and yaw rate ratio was proposed to measure the severity of consecutive conflicts. Moreover, bivariate logistic models that account for and not account for the correlation between the pedestrian-motorized vehicle (P-MV) conflict and the pedestrian-non-motorized vehicle (P-NV) conflict of a consecutive conflict were developed, and speed-, count-, time to zebra-related factors and other factors of involved road users were considered in the models. A total of 899 consecutive conflicts were identified and on average one in six pedestrians encountered consecutive conflicts. The bivariate logistic modeling results show that the model accounting for the correlation significantly outperform its counterpart. A negative correlation is found between the severities of P-MV conflict and P-NV conflict, and the P-NV conflict is more likely to be the serious one. It is also found that speed of motorized vehicle and time to zebra for the first conflicting subject are the common factors that affect the severities of both P-NV conflicts and P-MV conflicts, while speed of pedestrian, speed of non-motorized vehicle, number of motorized vehicles, number of non-motorized vehicles, group and direction of pedestrians have significant effects on the severity of either P-MV conflicts or P-NV conflicts.}

A major reason for vehicle-VRU collisions is driver attentional errors. Prior studies suggest that cross-modal transportation experiences (e.g., being a driver who also cycles) improve visual attention allocation toward VRUs. However, these studies were conducted in simulators or in a laboratory, limiting their generalizability to real world driving. We utilized an instrumented vehicle equipped with eye tracking technology to examine (a) the prevalence of drivers’ visual scanning failures toward VRUs at real intersections and (b) whether there is an effect of cycling experience on this prevalence. Twenty-six experienced drivers (13 cyclists and 13 non-cyclists), between the ages of 35 and 54, completed 18 different turns at urban Toronto intersections, for which gaze and video data were utilized to determine drivers’ visual scanning failures towards areas where conflicting VRUs could approach. Among the 443 unique turn events, 25% were identified as having a visual scanning failure. Results from a mixed effects logit model showed that the odds of committing visual scanning failures towards VRUs during a turning maneuver at an intersection were 2.01 times greater for drivers without cycling experience compared to drivers with cycling experience. Given that our participants represented a low crash-risk age group, this study suggests that the rate at which VRUs are unattended to may be much higher.}

Background
Distracted walking has been increasingly considered a public safety issue over the past few years. Research has focused on understanding the many factors that may influence pedestrians’ engagement with smart-devices in order to address this issue. Risk perception may be one factor that guides engagement decisions but has not been widely studied in the context of distracted walking. Risk perception and the consequences of distracted walking are likely to be impacted by the walking environment, however, current research has typically focused on a subset of locations— streets and intersections.
Method
This study used the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), a national database of injuries due to consumer products, to understand the number and severity of distracted walking injuries and locations where it occurred. Phone related injury cases from 2011 to 2019 were extracted and categorized by two independent raters in terms of cause of injury and location of injury. An online questionnaire, N = 207, was used to understand how individuals’ perception of risk in five different walking environments (intersections, stairwells, hallways, pedestrian plazas, and parking lots) were related to distraction engagement. Risk perception was measured through three different framings: risk of distracted walking (i.e., overall risk of engaging with the behavior), risk of collision and risk of falls (e.g., risks associated with the consequences of engaging with the behavior).
Results
The NEISS analysis showed an upward trend of distracted walking injuries from 2011 (2184 incidents) to 2019 (4711 incidents) and that the number of injuries differed across the different walking environments. The survey results showed that individuals varied their risk perception levels (risk of distracted walking, collision, and falls) based on the walking environment and distraction status (distraction and no distraction). The relationship between overall risk of distracted walking and the risks of the different consequences (falls \& collision) differed by walking environment. Finally, significant negative correlations were found between risk perception and actual distraction engagement for each location.}

abstract = {Introduction
Previous research suggests that driving practice in diverse contexts may contribute to earlier licensure and improve driving skills among teen drivers. However, few studies have examined the role of practice diversity in driving outcomes post-licensure. Specifically, examining self-regulatory driving practices post-licensure may provide insight into the extent to which teens choose to avoid driving various environments. The current study examined the relationship between learner phase driving practice diversity and teen self-regulatory driving practices over the first six months of licensure.
Methods
Fifty-six newly licensed 16-year-olds reported pre-licensure practice diversity, driving exposure and, self-regulatory driving practices at three timepoints (within 2 weeks of licensure and at 3 and 6 months post-licensure).
Results
Multi-level models revealed self-regulatory driving practices significantly decreased over the first six months of independent driving. Practice in complex environments (e.g., on a commercial road, on a highway, etc.) was associated with fewer self-regulatory driving practices at baseline. Practice in simple environments (e.g., in a residential area, in a parking lot) was associated with more self-regulatory driving practices at baseline. Practice driving at night and in bad weather conditions predicted greater post-licensure self-regulation of driving in those specific environments.
Conclusion
This study reinforces the importance of practice diversity for teens before independent driving, as early practice can have implications for self-regulatory driving practices immediately upon licensure. Future research examining this topic may inform parent-based interventions to maximize teen driver safety during the critical post-licensure period.}

The simulator study designed and evaluated alternative RICWS designs to existing RICWS interventions, in varying rural driving scenarios, across age groups (N = 40 novice teenage, 40 middle-aged, and 40 older drivers). Each participant was randomly assigned to a RICWS design, either the original or an alternative, and drove through sequences of 17 thru-STOP controlled rural intersections (nine RICWS intervention and eight control intersections). Drivers’ gap acceptance performance, intersection driving performance, traffic violation behaviors and self-reported workload were evaluated between intervention and control intersections. Regression models, applying the Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE), enabled efficacy determination of each RICWS design and an aggregated RICWS intervention effect, averaged across all simulated RICWS designs, among different levels of moderating factors. The safety performance and possible risks associated with the use of different RICWS designs were identified. Specifically, the original RICWS design had a significantly greater risk of STOP-sign violations at clear-view intersections with low traffic volumes, compared with control intersections (Risk Ratio = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.03 to 4.64). Except for Alternative RICWS Design 1, the alternative RICWS designs did not appear to outperform the Original RICWS Design. The moderating effects of drivers’ ages and intersection types on aggregated RICWS intervention effects were also examined. This study provides important safety implications for development and evaluation of intelligent intersection warning systems, targeted to vulnerable driver populations at high-risk rural intersections.}

The current study builds on these findings, testing the applicability of the attribution-of-blame model of perceptions of injustice and expanding existing models of retaliatory driving aggression to include unjust world beliefs and sensitivity to injustice. A sample of 269 participants from a large urban Canadian university viewed five animated driving scenarios (i.e., a queuing violation, a dangerous turn in front of oncoming traffic, selfish parking behavior, misuse of a high occupancy vehicle lane, and a driver failing to stop at a red light). Prior to viewing each scenario, a brief written description of the scenario was provided to each participant and read aloud by the experimenter. After viewing each scenario, participants completed a questionnaire regarding their attributions, emotions, and anticipated behavior in response to the animated scenario. After viewing all animated videos, participants completed a second questionnaire that assessed individual differences and demographic variables. Consistent with the GAM, structural equation and mediation analyses identified a significant path from individual differences (i.e., belief in an unjust world and driving injustice sensitivity), through internal states (i.e., perceptions of injustice and anger), to retaliatory aggressive driving. Results of this study found consistent paths between factors which were significant across all five scenarios and may therefore be generalizable to other driving situations. Other pathways were found to influence only a selection of the five scenarios, suggesting that they may be situation specific. Results provide support for possible intervention strategies that can be employed by driver education programs to reduce aggressive driving.}

In a repeated measures driving simulator study (n = 85), drivers drove the same route three times, each trial containing four lane changes that were all either (1) automated, (2) semi-automated or (3) manual. Each ride ended with a critical take-over situation that could be solved by braking and/or steering. Critical take-over reactions were analyzed with a linear mixed model and parametric accelerated failure time survival analysis. As expected, semi-automated and manual lane changes throughout the ride led to 13.5% and 17.0% faster maximum deceleration compared to automated lane changes. Additionally, semi-automated and manual lane changes improved the quality of the take-over by significantly decreasing standard deviation of the steering wheel angle. Unexpectedly, drivers in the semi-automated condition were slowest to start the braking maneuver. This may have been caused by the drivers’ confusion as to how the semi-automated system would react. Additionally, the percentage gaze off-the-road was significantly decreased by the semi-automated (6.0%) and manual (6.6%) lane changes. Taken together, the results suggest that semi-automated and manual transitions may be an alarm-free instrument which developers could use to help maintain drivers’ perception–action loop and improve automated driving safety.}

The potential factors influencing violations include 24 independent factors related to time, space, traffic and weather. Results from a logistic model showed that the midday period, weekends, residential districts, collector roads, congested traffic conditions, high traffic flow, lower wind speed and low temperature would increase the probability of traffic violations. The probability of violations was predicted by the random forest algorithm, which was proven to be the best traffic violation prediction model among logistic regression, Gaussian naive Bayes, and support vector machine. Moreover, the proximity weighted synthetic oversampling technique (ProWSyn) method was applied to reduce the impact of the imbalance ratio (IR) and improve the model’s prediction performance. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves and Precision-Recall (PR) curves illustrated that the random forest algorithm using oversampling data had the best classifier prediction performance than undersampling data. The area under curve (AUC) and out-of-bag (OOB) error with IR = 1 reached 0.914 and 0.0787, which showed the better performance of the random forest algorithm using ProWSyn in dealing with imbalanced traffic violation data.}

abstract = {Introduction
Recent research suggests that COVID-19 associated stay-at-home orders, or shelter-in-place orders, have impacted intra-and-interstate travel as well as motor vehicle crashes (crashes). We sought to further this research and to understand the impact of the stay-at-home order on crashes in the post order period in Connecticut.
Methods
We used a multiple-comparison group, interrupted time-series analysis design to compare crashes per 100 million vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per week in 2020 to the average of 2017–2019 from January 1-August 31. We stratified crash rate by severity and the number of vehicles involved. We modeled two interruption points reflecting the weeks Connecticut implemented (March 23rd, week 12) and rescinded (May 20th, week 20) its stay-at-home order.
Results
During the initial week of the stay-at-home order in Connecticut, there was an additional 28 single vehicle crashes compared to previous years (95% confidence interval (CI): [15.8, 36.8]). However, the increase at the order onset was not seen throughout the duration. Rescinding the stay-at-home order by and large did not result in an immediate increase in crash rates. Crash rates steadily returned to previous year averages during the post-stay-at-home period. Fatal crash rates were unaffected by the stay-at-home order and remained similar to previous year rates throughout the study duration.
Discussion
The initial onset of the stay-at-home order in Connecticut was associated with a sharp increase in the single vehicle crash rate but that increase was not sustained for the remainder of the stay-at-home order. Likely changes in driver characteristics during and after the order kept fatal crash rates similar to previous years.}

At intersections, Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) systems and dynamic speed advisories are among the proactive real-time safety interventions that can assist in preventing rear-end collisions. This study proposes a Signal-Vehicle Coupled Control (SVCC) system incorporating ATSC and speed advisories to optimize safety in real-time. By applying a rule-based approach in conjunction with a Soft-Actor Critic RL framework, the system assigns speed advisories to platoons of vehicles on each approach and extends the current signal time accordingly. Dynamic traffic parameters are collected in real-time and are used to estimate the current conflict rate at the intersection, which is then used both as an input to the model and to evaluate performance. The system was tested on two different intersections modeled using real-world data through the simulation platform VISSIM. Traffic conflicts were reduced by 41–55%, and vehicle delay was reduced by 21–24%. The results also show that the system functions at lower levels of market penetration, with diminishing returns beyond 50% MPR. The proposed system presents an SVCC framework that is both effective and low in computational intensity to optimize safety at signalized intersections.}

abstract = {Currently, the road safety performance of a national- or province-level is absorbing much attention from practitioners and academics. A variety of models based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) have been presented to appraise road safety performance in previous literature. However, the main weakness of these methods is that the decision-maker’s psychological behavior is neglected. Besides, Cross Efficiency Method (CEM) adopts the weighted average to aggregate the cross efficiencies which may lead to information loss. To address these limitations, a hybrid road safety evaluation model was constructed by integrating CEM, regret theory, and Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) to appraise the road safety performance of Chinese provinces. In the presented model, regret theory is employed to depict the psychological behavior of the decision-maker. Then entropy weight method is utilized to calculate the weight of self-evaluation and peer-evaluation. To reduce information loss, WASPAS is adopted to fuse the cross efficiencies and derive the ranking of decision-making units. Finally, the presented model is employed to assess the road safety efficiency in the province of mainland China. The results show that the mean of road safety efficiency score for the eastern, central, and western areas is gradually decreasing. Furthermore, the outcomes of a comparative analysis represent that the results obtained by the proposed model outperform the CEM and DEA road safety model.}

It aggregates different road safety performance indicators observed over different periods for which multicriteria and multi-period approaches are used. The criticality of a road depends on the interaction of various factors, such as human factors, causes of accidents and their severity levels, and the characteristics/states of the roads. Therefore, there is a need for a multidimensional view of risk and its consequences concerning traffic accidents. Furthermore, using the Multiple Criteria Decision Making/Aid methods (MCDM/A) allows the performance of roads in the multiple criteria to be considered according to the decision maker's preferences. On the other hand, the temporal approach reflects the performance of roads and their accidents in different periods, enabling the information on the temporal behavior of accidents to be aggregated to the result. Given that Brazil has a vast road network, there is thus the problem of prioritizing road segments to allocate resources for traffic accident prevention and mitigation actions, especially as these resources are usually limited and scarce. For that, a case study is developed in the state of Pernambuco in Brazil. Eleven road segments are analyzed. The strategic objective of the decision-maker is to have a broader view, initially, of the criticality of these road segments in terms of safety so that strategically he can allocate resources to prevent and mitigate the risks of traffic accidents. For this, the decision-maker considered eleven criteria. These represent the different dimensions that can influence traffic accidents, such as the damage (impacts) to human beings or other consequences resulting from traffic accidents and issues related to the characteristics/state of the road and its traffic. Five periods of time were considered to incorporate the temporal influence of these dimensions (2015 to 2019). As a result, it is seen that, for a more comprehensive assessment, it is essential to consider a multidimensional view of risk and a multi-period evaluation, thus incorporating more information into the decision model and thereby making its results more assertive.}

We apply the framework to gain insights into the characteristics of six widely-used SMoS for longitudinal maneuvers, i.e., Time to Collision (TTC), single-step Probabilistic Driving Risk Field (S-PDRF), Deceleration Rate to Avoid a Crash (DRAC), Potential Index for Collision with Urgent Deceleration (PICUD), Proactive Fuzzy Surrogate Safety Metric (PFS), and the Critical Fuzzy Surrogate Safety Metric (CFS). To ensure comparability, all measures are calibrated with the same risk detection criterion. Four performance indicators, i.e., Prediction Accuracy, Timeliness, Robustness, and Efficiency are computed for all six SMoS and validated using naturalistic driving data. The strengths and weaknesses of all six measures are compared and analyzed elaborately. A key result is that not a single SMoS performs well in all performance dimensions. S-PDRF performs best in terms of Robustness but consumes the most time for computation. TTC is the most efficient but performs poorly in terms of Timeliness and Robustness. The proposed evaluation approach and the derived insights can support SMoS selection in active vehicle safety system design and traffic safety assessment.}

Different oversampling methodologies are analyzed to balance the training data, finding that the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks technique with random undersampling presents better results when generating synthetic instances that permit maximizing the predictive performance.

However, the level of distraction by NDRTs may affect the transition from automated driving to the human driver taking over. The focus of the present study was allowing a driver immersed in NDRTs to discover the TOR and take control of the driving quickly. A 3×2×2 factor experimental design was used: vehicle display interface information load (basic vs. prediction vs. advanced prediction interfaces); TOR information load (directional vs. non-directional information notifications); and degree of NDRT immersion (not performing vs. performing an NDRT when TOR prompt was issued). 48 participants were recruited, and different automotive display interfaces were used as TOR prompts with different information loads during driving to analyze the takeover behavior, performance, and subjective perception of the drivers, who were immersed in a smartphone-related task. The takeover process out of NDRT immersion was found to be more efficient with the advanced prediction interface, compared to the other two interfaces. All groups achieved faster takeovers and demonstrated better takeover performance if given directional rather than non-directional information, regardless of interface type or NDRT immersion.}

This study investigates the safety performance when AVs interact with pedestrians approaching from far-side sidewalks to UMCs considering the visual occlusion of opposing vehicles. A mathematical model is proposed for judging the visibilities of objects from observers’ location under the impact of visual obstacles and is embedded into an agent-based pedestrian-vehicle interaction framework. Two yielding decision modules is assumed for AVs: The normal decision module implements the pedestrian priority rule simply based on the current detectable information, whereas the memory aid decision module extends AVs’ detection abilities by incorporating the memory data. Through simulation experiments, it is found that the percentages of short post encroachment time (%SPET) between AVs and far-side pedestrians reach peaks when the pedestrian flow rate is 300–400 ped/h. When opposing vehicles are in stationary queue conditions, %SPETs are only sensitive to the net distance between the last opposing vehicles in the queue and crosswalks (Dqueue). As the Dqueue decreases to lower than 15 m, %SPETs start to increase drastically. However, when opposing vehicles are in free flow conditions, %SPETs are influenced by multiple factors such as pedestrians’ crossing decisions, sizes and flow rates of opposing vehicles. Furthermore, only when opposing vehicles are in free flow conditions, memory aid AVs can significantly eliminate the impacts of opposite vehicles. Finally, several countermeasures are developed to enhance the visibility and safety at UMCs based on the findings of this study.}

To understand the factors associated with crash outcomes, four crash-severity models were developed: (1) Single-vehicle (SV) crashes prior to lockdown order (Normal times SV); (2) multi-vehicle (MV) crashes prior to lockdown order (Normal times MV); (3) Single-vehicle crashes after lockdown order (COVID times SV); and (4) Multi-vehicle crashes after lockdown order (COVID times MV). The models were developed using the first 28 weeks of crashes recorded in 2020. The findings of the study reveal that although traffic volumes and vehicle miles traveled had significantly dropped during the lockdown, there was an increase in the total number of crashes and major injury crashes compared to the period prior to the lockdown order, with speeding, DUI, and weekends accounting for a significant proportion of these crashes. These observations provide useful lessons for road safety improvements during extreme events that may require statewide lockdown, as has been done with the COVID-19 pandemic. Traffic management around shopping areas and other areas that may experience increased traffic volumes provide opportunities for road safety stakeholders to reduce the occurrence of crashes in the weeks leading to an announcement of any future statewide or local lockdowns. Additionally, increased law enforcement efforts can help to reduce risky driving activities as traffic volumes decrease.}

We developed an intervention that provides feedback on accuracy of self-awareness of driving performance using a workbook, and examined its effectiveness using a prospective design with a follow-up after two months. Japanese drivers aged between 69 and 87 (Mean = 73.96) years were assigned to either the intervention group (n = 26) or the wait-list control group (n = 27). All participants were asked to assess their own driving performance by completing a questionnaire. They also completed an on-road driving assessment that involved driving on a public road while wearing an electronic device that measured their actual driving behaviors, accompanied by a driving instructor who sat in the passenger seat and assessed the participant’s driving performance (expert assessment). Thereafter, only the intervention group received the immediate intervention (first wave). One month later, the intervention group completed the booster intervention by post. Two months after the first wave, both groups completed the questionnaire and on-road driving assessment again (second wave). Result revealed that discrepancy between self-assessment and expert assessment reduced in only the intervention group between the two waves. This finding suggests that the intervention was able to improve the accuracy of self-assessment. Furthermore, the expert assessment improved in the intervention group between the two waves, but this change was not observed in the control group. Similar trend was evident for vehicle speed at intersections with a stop sign but the result was not statistically significant. Changes in head rotation at intersections requiring turn in the intervention group did not differ from those in the control group. Improved accuracy of self-assessment as a result of the intervention could have led to improved general driving performance, but did not influence head rotation.}

To implement the United Nations’ 2030 agenda for sustainable development, governmental strategies aim to accelerate the shift to sustainable and smart mobility. Consequently, e-micromobility (EMM) appeared as a practical solution for short-distance commuters, and it is growing at upsetting rates thanks to the introduction of sharing services. In fact, urban mobility has drastically changed over the last decade, and electric mobility and micromobility changed the panorama in larger metropolises, given their accessibility, large availability, and the potential to be a time saver in short trips and a potentially sustainable alternative in particular scenarios. The downside of portable e-transportation is the rapid increase in injuries and fatalities. Focusing on standing e-scooters, head injuries are becoming one of the most common as shown by research conducted in different urban emergency departments, alongside bone fractures, skin abrasions, and lacerations. In this work, a comprehensive review is carried out focusing on head protection for EMM, mostly for e-scooters, and the respective target markets, safety measures, and existing regulations. In the end, a critical assessment is given with recommendations for legislators and future research. Users are mostly males from 18 to 40 years old, upper-to-middle income, with elevated levels of educational attainment. Their motivation to use e-scooters is mainly to replace short walking trips. EMM, in particular e-scooters, will continue to grow thanks to its potential to substitute other micromobility alternatives. The evolution of safety measures and regulations did not keep pace with such a drastic change in mobility trends. This is evident considering how some countries are struggling with vehicle categories and regulations for helmet use and testing. The lack of legal obligation to wear a helmet and the absence of an adequate and feasible concept of protective equipment for sharing services are the main barriers to helmet use among riders. Mitigation measures have been implemented by the EMM sharing companies to improve the safety of its users by checking if they wear helmets and by offering vehicle-integrated solutions.}

abstract = {Collision warning systems can improve traffic safety, while their safety benefit may be lessened due to improper risk compensation or system misuse. There are limited studies of advanced safety systems increasing unexpected risky driving behavior, especially with adolescent drivers. This study is designed to address this research gap in two main areas: 1) it seeks to examine whether and how the introduction of advanced driver-assistance systems influences drivers’ risk compensation behavior (e.g., increase of hard braking frequency), and 2) it investigates key factors (e.g., distraction) that contribute to changes in hard braking frequency during driving for both teen and adult drivers. Naturalistic driving data from two previous studies were analyzed in this study with two methods: a hierarchical logistic regression model was used to evaluate the effects of an integrated collision warning system on hard braking behavior, while a Random forests algorithm was applied to model hard braking behavior and to rank the contributing factors by calculating the importance scores. No statistical evidence was observed that the integrated collision warning system significantly changed the likelihood of hard braking for teen or adult drivers. Other factors like distraction, especially visual-manual distraction, had the largest impact on the hard braking behavior, followed by speeding and roadway segments (i.e., at intersections or not). Short time-headways and driving in high-density traffic significantly increased the likelihood of hard braking. Furthermore, the rate of hard braking behavior on surface roads was much higher than on highways, as expected. Compared with straight road segments, hard braking behavior was less likely to occur on curve roads. This study applied an analytical strategy by using both machine learning and statistical analysis methods to achieve high model accuracy and facilitate inference concerning the relationships among variables. Findings in this study can help to improve the design of integrated collision warning systems and the use of autonomous braking systems, and to apply appropriate analysis methods in understanding teen drivers’ behavior changes with those safety systems.}

The travel environment for people with visual impairment includes pedestrian safety concerns, especially when crossing roads at intersections. Tactile paving can be used as a guidance cue for street-crossing purposes but its use is not yet widespread globally (except at some test sites in Japan). This study investigated the effectiveness of tactile paving on crosswalks based on a field trial conducted in China. A drone and three-axis accelerometer were used to collect participants’ behavioral data. Several quantitative indices for street-crossing behavior, including trajectory, maximum distance of the directional deviation, crossing speed, crossing time, and gait regularity and symmetry, were investigated to measure the participants’ street-crossing performance. Before-after comparative analysis of the quantitative index results was conducted to compare the participants’ use of crosswalks with and without tactile paving. The results reveal that tactile paving helps people with visual impairment to maintain a straight crossing path, avoid directional deviation, reduce their crossing time, and improve their gait regularity and symmetry. Study participants reported positive impressions of the effectiveness of crosswalk tactile paving based on one-to-one interviews conducted after the crosswalk tests. The results also indicate that crosswalk tactile paving is more effective for people with blindness than for those with low vision. This study’s findings could serve as a theoretical basis for the deployment of various barrier-free traffic facilities (especially street-crossing facilities) for people with visual impairment.}

The aim with this study was to investigate injuries associated with e-scooters in Sweden and to identify accident characteristics. In addition, the aim was to observe how different data collection procedures and samples may influence the results. Two complementary data sets were used; insurance data including all reported injuries to Folksam Insurance Group during the period January 2019 to May 2020 and the Swedish Traffic Accident Data Acquisition database (STRADA), the national system for road traffic injury data collection, was used to study accident related to e-scooter use in the Stockholm city area between May and the end of August 2019. Most of the injuries associated with e-scooters occurred in single crashes, but in 13% of the accidents another road user was injured, either due to interactions with e-scooters or due to a parked e-scooter being a hazard. In both data sets more than half of the accidents occurred during weekends. In total 46% of all who had visited an emergency department the accident occurred during night-time (10 pm to 6 am). The overall large proportion of injuries to the head and face indicates the need for actions aimed to increase helmet use among e-scooter riders. Local authorities should take a wider responsibility since one third of all accidents primarily occurred due to lack of maintenance or that the rider hit a curb stone. In comparison to hospital data, insurance claims include riders with all types of injuries irrespectively what type of healthcare the rider was seeking. Hence, to better understand the consequences and to make the right decisions regarding countermeasures aimed to improve the safety of e-scooter riding, data from different data source are needed.}

abstract = {Background
Several medical conditions are known to impair sensory, cognitive and motor functions and are associated with road traffic crashes (RTC). For the drivers of today, we lack updated knowledge on how driving-impairing conditions are associated with RTCs, across all driving-impairing conditions in a given population. We aim to determine this among older drivers in Sweden.
Methods
A national, population register-based, matched case-control study comparing acknowledged driving-impairing health conditions among all older drivers (65 years or older) involved in an injurious RTC in the period 2011–2016 (n = 13,701) with those of controls: older drivers not involved in any RTC (n = 26,525) matched to the cases by age, sex and residential area. The medical conditions, extracted from the National Patient Register from 1997 up until date of RTC, were identified based on ICD-10 diagnosis codes and categorized into the 13 groups of medical conditions listed in the Swedish driver’s license regulations. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals.
Results
Unadjusted ORs for RTC were increased for all conditions. After taking the other 12 medical conditions into account, the ORs remained significant in 11 out of the 13. A strong association was found for the group “ADHD and autism spectrum disorders” (OR 2.79, CI 1.47–5.30), although with very low prevalence among cases (0.2%). Moderate associations were found for three conditions with a case prevalence between 1.3% and 8.5%: epilepsy and seizure disorders (OR 1.53, CI 1.25–1.89), substance abuse and dependence (OR 1.45, CI 1.29–1.63), psychological diseases and mental disorders (OR 1.28, CI 1.18–1.39) and for one condition with a case prevalence of 14.7%, diabetes (OR 1.28, CI 1.20–1.36).
Conclusions
In Sweden, in the current generation of older drivers, acknowledged driving-impairing medical conditions at the national and European levels remain a concern. After adjustment for one another, all but 2 of the conditions are associated with RTCs albeit to varying degrees and more pronounced in the age group 65–79 compared to 80 or older. To promote and sustain older people’s mobility, addressing this issue will require a blend of interventions where, hopefully, technological and infrastructural innovations may help counteracting individual health-related shortcomings.}

The rush hour represents the period of the day during which the density of humans and vehicles in the road environment is highest. In the U.S., the rush hour period is bi-modal, occurring in the morning and the afternoon, at times that vary by state and urban–rural status. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the association between the rush hour period and fatal and non-fatal crash injuries. Selected articles were limited to peer-reviewed full-text articles that measured crash injury as an outcome and rush hour as either a predictor, covariate, stratification, or a control variable. A total of 17 articles were identified for systematic review and nine articles were included in the meta-analysis. Across the selected studies, the rush-hour period signified the period of “peak traffic flow.” During the rush hour period, aggressive driving behavior, truck driving, bicycle riding, and precipitation were associated with increased crash events or crash injuries. Across the nine studies included in the meta-analysis, the effective sample size was 236,433. The rush-hour period was associated with a 28% increased risk of fatal crash injury (Pooled RR: 1.28; 95% CI: 1.11–1.45) and the morning rush hour period was associated with 36% increased crash injury risk (Pooled RR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.13–1.59). The rush hour period, though less commonly studied as a predictor of fatal and non-fatal crash injuries, represents an important domain in need of crash injury prevention attention. The knowledge of the pattern of crash injuries, as it varies across countries, states, regions, and county can inform policy and intervention, in the presence of competing public health needs.}

Hauer has suggested (2019) that not finding an effect of the measure being evaluated could be one reason for this. This paper provides an inventory of experimental evaluations of road safety measures. 24 different road safety measures have been evaluated experimentally. More than one experiment was reported for 8 road safety measures; for the other 16 only a single experiment was found. With few exceptions, experiments find no effect on accidents of the measures subjected to experiments. Most of the exceptions are due either to failure of randomisation or refer to measures whose effects tend to erode as they become more commonly used. Thus, the effects found in initial experiments with daytime running lights and high-mounted stop lamps have gradually eroded as more cars got these systems. Driver training is one of the few road safety measures for which more than one experiment has been carried out. Results consistently show no effect on accidents of driver training.}

This study proposes a framework to identify aggressive driving patterns in longitudinal control using real-time driving profiles of heavy passenger vehicle (HPV) drivers. The main objective is to detect and quantify the instantaneous driving decisions and classify the identified maneuvers (acceleration, braking) using unsupervised machine learning techniques without any prior-ground truth. To this end, total 8295 acceleration events, and 7151 braking events, were extracted from 142 driving profiles collected using high-resolution (10 Hz) GPS instrumentation. The principal component analysis was conducted on a multi-dimensional feature set, followed by a two-stage k-means clustering on the reduced feature subspace. The results showed that 86.5% of accelerations and 65.3% of braking maneuvers were characterized as non-aggressive, indicating safe or base-line driving behavior. However, 13.5% of accelerations and 34.7% of braking maneuvers were featured to be aggressive, indicative of the actual risky behaviors. Further analysis demonstrated the heterogeneity in drivers’ trip-level frequency of aggressive maneuvers and highlighted the need for a continuous driving assessment. The study also revealed that the thresholds derived from the obtained clusters featuring the aggressive accelerations (+0.3 to +0.48 g) and aggressive braking (−0.42 to −0.27 g) maneuvers were beyond the acceptable limits of passenger safety and comfort. The insights from the study aids in developing driver assistance systems for personalized feedback provision and improve driver behavior.}

abstract = {Safety evaluation of signalized intersections is often conducted by developing statistical and data-driven methods based on data aggregated at certain temporal and spatial levels (e.g., yearly, hourly, or per signal cycle; intersection or approach leg). However, such aggregations are subject to a major simplification that masks the underlying spatio-temporal safety risk patterns within the data aggregation levels. Consequently, high-resolution analysis such as safety risk within signal cycles and at traffic movement level cannot be performed. This study contributes to the literature by proposing a new functional data analysis (FDA) approach for a novel characterization of safety risk patterns of signalized intersections. Functional data smoothing methods that can mitigate overfitting and account for the nonnegative characteristics of safety risk are proposed to model the time series of safety risk within signal cycles at the traffic movement level. Functional analysis of variance method (FANOVA) that can compare the group level differences of functional curves is used to test differences of safety risk functions among different traffic movements. A typical signalized intersection with representative signal types and channelizations is selected as the study location and approximately 1-hour traffic video data recorded by an unmanned aerial vehicle are used to extract traffic conflicts. New movement-level safety risk patterns are characterized based on the safety risk functions that can reveal the temporal distribution of risk within signal cycles. Most of the tested traffic movements have significantly distinct functional risk patterns according to the FANOVA results while risk patterns for most of the traffic movements cannot be differentiated based on the data aggregated at the cycle and approach levels. The proposed functional approach has the potential to be used for facilitating proactive safety management, calibrating microsimulation models for safety evaluation, and optimizing signal timing while considering traffic safety at more disaggregated levels.}

abstract = {Collisions between road users and trains at urban railway level crossings persist, despite active protection. The number of railway level crossings in most settings render their removal unfeasible. To effectively reduce or manage risk, alternative treatments are required. Increases in road and rail traffic invariably result in congestion issues at urban railway level crossings, which influences non-compliances by road users. Automated enforcement is one form of treatment that is being considered to reduce such non-compliances. This study conceptualised and adopted a before—after design to evaluate the effect of a conspicuous monitoring system on non-compliances by vehicular road users at an active level crossing. Baseline measurements of vehicle movements and level crossing status were recorded for two months. Conspicuous cameras and radar were subsequently installed, and a further month of data was recorded. Non-compliances with flashing lights were extracted and arranged into “must stop” and “should stop if safe to do so” categories, aligning with road rules at traffic lights. Non-compliances frequently occurred (N = 1,086) with most (94%) of the latter category and ascribed to a lack of an advanced warning before crossing closure. Analysis with Generalised Linear Models revealed that non-compliances where drivers must stop reduced by 36% (from 13.4% to 8.6%) following the introduction of a conspicuous automated monitoring system, even though no actual enforcement was performed. This study suggests that non-compliances at railway level crossings have the potential to be reduced through the introduction of automated enforcement similar to the one used at traffic lights.}

In a nationwide random sample, 17-year-old accompanied novice drivers (n = 2,478) and 18-year-old novices (n = 925) who had conventionally acquired a driver’s license were surveyed about their novice driver-specific social resources, using specially developed measurement tools such as a resource generator. The results revealed that the proportion of a young driver’s friends currently taking or having taken part in AD17 is a major predictor for participation in AD17. To a lesser extent, family-based social capital positively correlates to voluntary participation in AD17. Future optimization efforts should therefore take into account providing support for family-based social resources, including the possibility of compensation. Additionally, considering the composition of the young driver’s peer group is strongly recommended.}

It was revealed that precipitation, extremely low temperatures, and the potential of black ice formation all had significant negative direct effects on pavement friction and significant indirect negative effects on traffic safety. Moreover, the application of anti-icing agents and plowing operations have been shown to significantly improve pavement friction and in return improve traffic safety indirectly. To illustrate how the maintenance operations improve traffic safety, a hypothetical snowstorm example was considered. According to the model, anti-icing application was associated with a 14% reduction in collisions, plowing operations resulted in a 33% reduction in collisions, and combining the two tools reduced collisions per snowstorm by 42%. The findings of this paper can help transportation agencies make more informed decisions to promote an efficient mobilization of the existing winter road maintenance services and resources while improving the safety of the traveling public during the winter months.}

abstract = {Preventing and mitigating high severity collisions is one of the main opportunities for Automated Driving Systems (ADS) to improve road safety. This study evaluated the Waymo Driver’s performance within real-world fatal collision scenarios that occurred in a specific operational design domain (ODD). To address the rare nature of high-severity collisions, this paper describes the addition of novel techniques to established safety impact assessment methodologies. A census of fatal, human-involved collisions was examined for years 2008 through 2017 for Chandler, AZ, which overlaps the current geographic ODD of the Waymo One fully automated ride-hailing service. Crash reconstructions were performed on all available fatal collisions that involved a passenger vehicle as one of the first collision partners and an available map in this ODD to determine the pre-impact kinematics of the vehicles involved in the original crashes. The final dataset consisted of a total of 72 crashes and 91 vehicle actors (52 initiators and 39 responders) for simulations. Next, a novel counterfactual “what-if'' simulation method was developed to synthetically replace human-driven crash participants one at a time with the Waymo Driver. This study focused on the Waymo Driver’s performance when replacing one of the first two collision partners. The results of these simulations showed that the Waymo Driver was successful in avoiding all collisions when replacing the crash initiator, that is, the road user who made the initial, unexpected maneuver leading to a collision. Replacing the driver reacting (the responder) to the actions of the crash initiator with the Waymo Driver resulted in an estimated 82% of simulations where a collision was prevented and an additional 10% of simulations where the collision severity was mitigated (reduction in crash-level serious injury risk). The remaining 8% of simulations with the Waymo Driver in the responder role had a similar outcome to the original collision. All of these “unchanged” collisions involved both the original vehicle and the Waymo Driver being struck in the rear in a front-to-rear configuration. These results demonstrate the potential of fully automated driving systems to improve traffic safety compared to the performance of the humans originally involved in the collisions. The findings also highlight the major importance of driving behaviors that prevent entering a conflict situation (e.g. maintaining safe time gaps and not surprising other road users). However, methodological challenges in performing single instance counterfactual simulations based solely on police report data and uncertainty in ADS performance may result in variable performance, requiring additional analysis and supplemental methodologies. This study’s methods provide insights on rare, severe events that would otherwise only be experienced after operating in extreme real-world driving distances (many billions of driving miles).}

abstract = {Pedestrian fatalities and injuries are a major public health burden in developing countries. In the safety literature, pedestrian crashes have been modelled predominately using single equation regression models, assuming a single underlying source of risk factors. In contrast, the fatal pedestrian crash counts at a site may be an outcome of multiple sources of risk factors, such as poor road infrastructure, land use type, traffic exposures, and operational parameters, site-specific socio-demographic characteristics, as well as pedestrians’ poor risk perception and dangerous crossing behavior, which may be influenced by poor road infrastructure and lack of information, etc. However, these multiple sources are generally overlooked in traditional single equation crash prediction models. In this background, this study postulates, and demonstrates empirically, that the total fatal pedestrian crash counts at the urban road network level may arise from multiple simultaneous and interdependent sources of risk factors, rather than one. Each of these sources may distinctively contribute to the total observed crash count. Intersection-level crash data obtained from the “Kolkata Police”, India, is utilized to demonstrate the present modelling methodology. The three-components mixture model and a joint econometric model are developed to predict fatal pedestrian crashes. The study outcomes indicate that the multiple-source risk models perform significantly better than the single equation regression model in terms of prediction ability and goodness-of-fit measures. Moreover, while the single equation model predicts total fatal crash counts for individual sites, the multiple risk source model predicts crash count proportions contributed by each source of risk factors and predicts crashes by a particular source.}

The effective accepted gap (EAG), passing duration, number of passed vehicles, and the end position of maneuvers were the explanatory variables and the data used to estimate the model were collected from 319 PMs using a drone at seven passing zones in Iran. Results indicated that 85% of the passing vehicles were safe in a single PM with EAGs greater than 22.4 sec for all types of passed vehicles. This safe EAG increased by up to 30.9 sec for vehicles involved in multiple PMs with two passed vehicles and 52 sec for those with three or more. Heavy vehicles required 3.1 sec more EAG than passenger cars to conduct a single PM and maneuvers ended in no-passing zones were more risky than those ending in a passing zone.}

Road Traffic Injuries (RTIs) are one of the most crucial and challenging public health problems in low and middle income countries. Despite continuous efforts to estimate both personal and societal costs of RTIs however, their long-term effects have remained marginal. The current study aimed to explore the economic burden of RTIs until one year after the victim’s hospitalization.
Methods
The study included a total of 1150 RTI victims, who were admitted to two trauma-referral hospitals during 2016. Data on direct medical costs, direct non-medical costs and indirect costs were gathered for each study sample via hospital records and phone surveys. Direct and indirect costs from a social perspective were estimated based on Micro Costing Approach followed by the Human Capital Approach. Also, the explanatory variables affecting the costs of RTIs were identified using the liner regression model.
Results
The average amounts of direct (medical, non-medical), indirect, and total costs of RTI were estimated as 2,908 US$ (1,591 US$, 1,316 US$), 5,790 US$, and 8,701 US$ respectively. Also, several variables were significantly affecting the costs of RTIs including age, marital status, employment status, severity of injury, receiving physiotherapy care, victim’s vehicle type in crash, crash time and location.
Conclusions
Findings suggest that RTIs are considered as an enormous burden on Iranian GDP per capita and health expenditure per capita occupying 167% and 347% respectively. This enormous economic burden caused by RTIs requires more policy regulations and prevention programs to decrease RTIs.}

Traffic flow, geometric design features and crash data from 80 segments on 14 freeways in the state of California, United States were applied. A multilevel logistic regression model with cross-level interactions was developed, where traffic variables were put on the case level, and their estimated coefficients were defined as a function of geometric design variables on the segment level. A basic logistic model and a multilevel logistic model without cross-level interactions were developed for comparison. The result shows that the one with cross-level interactions provides the best goodness of fit. The results indicate that six categories of geometric design variables are significantly associated with crash risk, i.e. lane configuration, basic number of lanes, ramp spacing, theoretical gore, inner shoulder width and speed limit. All but one (inner should width) geometric design variables have significant interaction terms with traffic flow variables. The effects of geometric design variables on crash risk are not fixed but vary with traffic conditions. The findings of this study can provide design guidance to improve road safety of freeway segments with closely spaced entrance and exit ramps.}

Although there are some studies on ATM strategies, few studies take the moving vehicle group as the object of analysis. Based on the crash risk prediction of moving vehicle groups in a connected vehicle (CV) environment, this study developed various ATM safety strategies, that is, variable speed limits (VSLs), ramp metering (RM), and coordinated VSL and RM (VSL-RM) strategies. VSLs were updated to minimize the crash risk of multiple moving vehicle groups in the next time interval, which is 1 min, and the updated speed limits were sent directly to the CVs in the moving vehicle group. The metering rate and RM opening time were determined using mainline occupancy, the crash risk of upcoming moving vehicle groups, and the predicted time at which moving vehicle groups arrived at the on-ramp. The VSL-RM strategy was used to simultaneously control and coordinate traffic flow on the mainline and ramps. These strategies were tested in a well-calibrated and validated micro-simulation network. The crash risk index and conflict count were utilized to evaluate the safety effects of these strategies. The results indicate that the ATM strategies improved the expressway safety benefits by 2.84–15.92%. The increase in CV penetration rate would promote the safety benefits of VSL and VSL-RM. Moreover, VSL-RM was superior to VSL and RM in reducing crash risk and conflict count.}

Many of those crashes result in severe consequences for cyclists. In order to increase the safety of cyclists, especially in the case of conflicts with right-turning vehicles, an online infrastructure-based assistance system may be a promising solution warning drivers and cyclists when a conflict or crash is predicted. By means of automated video traffic detection, the resulting trajectories of road users can be analysed and a warning can be sent to vehicles and cyclists equipped with vehicle-to-anything communication (V2X) when a high risk is estimated. An approach for online risk estimation was developed combining the surrogate measure of safety (SMoS) gap time (GT) with trajectory prediction-based estimates of the time-to-arrival (TTA) or distance to conflict point (DCp) and velocity (v). A decision tree as classifier of risk levels based on the previous named risk features was trained to model the risks perceived by humans. Expert ratings of traffic conflict scenes were used to build a model, apply the model, and improve it in the field. The warning system was evaluated by test drives in real traffic at the urban AIM Research Intersection in Braunschweig, Germany. In general, the system warned reliably. In approximately 67% of the trials, it was assessed as helpful.}

abstract = {Freeway jam waves create many problems, including capacity reduction, travel delays, and safety risks. The development of cooperative vehicle infrastructure system (CVIS) has prompted numerous new strategies, which can resolve jam waves by implementing microscopic car-following control actions to individual vehicles. However, most of those strategies aimed at eliminating freeway jam waves without considering the safety risks induced by the car-following control. This paper proposes an optimal control-based vehicle speed guidance strategy to improve both traffic efficiency and safety against jam waves. The optimal controller is developed based on a discrete first-order traffic flow model formulated in Lagrangian coordinates. The optimization of vehicles’ driving speed is formulated as a linear programming problem, where the constraints concerning threshold safety measures are imposed. The proposed vehicle speed guidance strategy is tested using a modified Intelligent Driving Model (IDM+), which represents real traffic dynamics in CVIS environment. The proposed speed guidance strategy is compared with a state-of-the-art jam-absorption driving strategy, which also aimed to eliminate freeway jam waves. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy outperforms that strategy in terms of both total time spent saving and surrogate safety measures’ reduction. The time exposed time-to-collision (TET) is reduced by 31%, and the time integrated time-to-collision (TIT) is reduced by 9.5% on average. Furthermore, the computation time of the linear optimization is only a few seconds, which is fast enough for the online application of the proposed strategy.}

Rider inexperience and the inexperience of other road users in interacting with e-scooters may be contributing to injuries. Shared e-scooters came to Brisbane, Australia, in November 2018 and our observational study in February 2019 found a high level of non-compliance with regulations by riders of shared, but not private, e-scooters. This paper examines whether e-scooter safety improved over time by comparing the numbers and behaviors of shared and private e-scooter riders with a follow-up observational study conducted in October 2019. Riders of e-scooters (and bicycles) were counted at six sites in inner-city Brisbane by trained observers over four weekdays. Type of e-scooter (private, Lime, Neuron), helmet use, gender, age group, riding location, time of day and presence of passengers were recorded. The number of shared e-scooters observed dropped from 711 in February to 495 in October but the number of private e-scooters increased from 90 to 269, resulting in a slight reduction in the total number of e-scooters. The correct helmet wearing rate increased non-significantly from 61.4% to 66.8% for shared e-scooters and remained high for riders of private e-scooters (95.5% in February and 94.3% in October). The percentage of e-scooters ridden on the road (which is illegal in central Brisbane) remained roughly the same (shared: 6.6% in February, 4.2% in October; private: 4.5% in February, 4.9% in October). The percentage of children and adolescents (illegally) riding shared e-scooters fell from 10.3% to 6.7%. The prevalence of any of these illegal behaviors among shared e-scooter riders fell significantly for shared e-scooter riders from 49.6% to 39.1% while the prevalence of illegal behaviors by other riders remained lower and did not change. The reduction in illegal behavior among shared e-scooter riders accompanied by the tripling of usage of private e-scooters suggests that e-scooter safety is likely to have improved.}

Since 2013, Taiwan's government has gradually required a road safety class (RSC) for the rider's licensing process. The RSC consisted of watching videotapes of motorcycle-involved crashes followed by lectures on safety measures. Our study tried to see whether a compulsory RSC could lower the likelihood and frequency of road accidents and traffic violations among novice riders. To avoid self-selection bias, we selected 480,114 novice riders aged 18–20 years, licensed one year before starting the trial period and one year after full implementation of RSC. Using the 2012–2018 data from the Taiwan Ministry of Transportation and Communication (MOTC), we applied the logistic model to evaluate RSC effects on the risk of violations and accidents. Then, we used the negative binomial regression to model their frequency in response to RSC exposure. Following the novice drivers 1–3 years after licensing, our results showed that the RSC has a short-term effect in lowering their traffic violations' likelihood by 12%∼17% and their frequency by 11%; however, the RSC effects only last two years in reducing the counts of motorcycle-involved offenses and accidents. The RSC reduction effect was lower for the tendency of accidents than the violations, probably because committing traffic violations was self-determined; in contrast, the collision occurrence was more or less related to the riders' own or other road users' carelessness. The RSC could be more effective if a certification test for road safety education were required or if a penalty is imposed on distracted learners during the training.}

Safety concepts to protect Powered Two-Wheeler (PTW) riders exist and are being developed further, but they need appropriate procedures and test tools (Anthropometric Test Devices (ATDs) for physical testing and Human Body Models (HBMs) for virtual testing) to direct and promote those developments. To aid further development of the tools, we aim to rank the frequency of specific injuries arising from the prevalent impact types, discuss how current ATDs and HBMs are equipped to assess these injuries, and suggest what further development should be prioritized. We analyzed a sample of injured riders from the German In-depth Accident Study (GIDAS) according to the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) 2015 classification, using severity thresholds of at-least-moderate (AIS2+) and at-least-serious (AIS3+). PTW rider injuries were ranked by frequency for all crashes and also for sub-samples of specific impact types (impact with passenger cars, ground, and roadside furniture). The most frequent AIS3+ injuries were: femur fracture (17%), rib cage fracture (13%), lung injury (9%), tibia fracture (7%), and cerebrum injury (7%). In all impacts together and as for impacts with the road surface, injuries to the thorax were most frequent. In impacts with cars and road furniture, thorax injuries were also frequent, but outranked by lower extremity injuries. Considering both AIS2+ and AIS3+ injuries, the priorities for PTW rider safety interventions are: fracture of the rib cage, femur fracture, tibia fracture, radius fracture, cerebrum injury, and cerebral concussion. The ATD currently used most frequently, the Hybrid III, is unlikely to provide adequate rib fracture injury assessments, but HBMs are promising in this area. Rib injury assessment may also reasonably predict other injuries that were correlated or in proximity to rib fractures: clavicle, lung, and upper abdomen organ injury. Lower extremity, upper extremity, and head injuries are likely addressable to some extent with current ATDs while HBMs hold the promise of more detailed and mechanism-specific injury assessments. Both ATDs and HBMs need more validation for use in the PTW environment.}

A computational model capturing these phenomena would have high applied value, for example in virtual vehicle safety testing methods, but existing models are either simplistic or not sufficiently validated. This paper extends an existing quantitative driver model for initiation and modulation of pre-crash brake response, to handle off-road glance behavior. The resulting models are fitted to time-series data from real-world naturalistic rear-end crashes and near-crashes. A stringent parameterization and model selection procedure is presented, based on particle swarm optimization and maximum likelihood estimation. A major contribution of this paper is the resulting first-ever fit of a computational model of human braking to real near-crash and crash behavior data. The model selection results also permit novel conclusions regarding behavior and accident causation: Firstly, the results indicate that drivers have partial visual looming perception during off-road glances; that is, evidence for braking is collected, albeit at a slower pace, while the driver is looking away from the forward roadway. Secondly, the results suggest that an important causation factor in crashes without off-road glances may be a reduced responsiveness to visual looming, possibly associated with cognitive driver state (e.g., drowsiness or erroneous driver expectations). It is also demonstrated that a model parameterized on less-critical data, such as near-crashes, may also accurately reproduce driver behavior in highly critical situations, such as crashes.}

It is critical to identify the factors that contribute to the development of expertise in the driving environment. The rapid development of a driver’s situation awareness (SA) is central to the safe performance of the driving task. Therefore, SA must be clearly operationalised in order to better assess its role in the development of expertise. This study employs an existing scheme based on the Perceptual Cycle Model (PCM) used for post hoc incident analysis and adapts it to the driving context. We attempted to correlate performance on coded verbalisations indicative of SA with non-invasive objective gaze metrics. Gaze metrics and the verbal counts were shown to differentiate between both expert and experienced (non-expert) drivers, but these measures failed to correlate with one another. Findings indicate differences in the way expert and experienced drivers update their schema of the driving task, with equivalent effort required to do so. The novel adaptation demonstrated in this paper allows for a domain-specific assessment of SA which reliably differentiates between drivers of varying expertise levels. Although selected gaze metrics were shown to be inadequate predictors of SA, additional analysis demonstrated key differences in gaze content. Combined, these findings enhance an understanding of expert SA development contributing to reduced crash risk.}

abstract = {The near-miss events involving vulnerable road users can lead to serious accidents. Safe and careful expert drivers perform a hazard-anticipatory driving and they will naturally seek to reduce the uncertainty by attempting to fit their current driving context into a pre-existing category they have already developed, that is, predicting what can happen. In this study, our target situation consists of a cyclist attempting a road crossing at a blind spot. This study aims at developing a context-aware driver model for determining the recommended driving speed at blind intersections based on the analysis of near-miss-incidence database, which includes the data on driver behavior and road environmental factors just before the near-miss. First, we extracted the drive-recorder data using the management tool provided in the database. Second, risk, which is defined as the time margin for drivers to perform evasive actions to avoid a crash, was quantified for the extracted data using the safety-cushion time. The safety-cushion time can be observed as a result of the driver’s adjustment to the vehicle velocity depending on the given road environment. One of the key aspects in developing the context-aware driver model is to categorize the extracted near-miss data into two levels based on the risk quantifications: low- and high-risk events. The low- and high-risk events were regarded as a result of the driver’s appropriate adjustment of, and inability or failure to adjust the vehicle velocity depending on the given road environment, respectively. Third, based on a multiple linear regression analysis with low-risk event dataset, we constructed a context-aware driver model to produce the recommended vehicle speed depending on the given road environment. The road environment variables, determined by stepwise regression, were identified as factors that reduced or increased the vehicle velocity at blind intersections, and were incorporated into the model as predictors. Furthermore, we quantitatively visualized drivers setting the baseline for speed adjustment and increasing or decreasing the speed according to the given road environment context. Fourth, the model validation demonstrated a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.20, and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 6.54 km/h on average in the 5-fold cross-validation. Finally, to investigate the effectiveness of the constructed driver model on safety performance, we used the dataset of high-risk events as test data. Theoretically, the constructed driver model guided the drivers to drive the vehicle at the recommended speed, and thus convert more than half of the high-risk events into low-risk events. These results indicate that the context-aware driver model is feasible to be used to adjust the approaching speed at blind intersections in accordance with the road environment factors.}

This study aimed to estimate the effects of stricter drunk-driving laws on alcohol-related road traffic death, injury, and crash rates in Korea. Using police-reported traffic accident data and registered vehicle data from 2013 to 2020, monthly road traffic outcome rates were calculated: the response series involved alcohol-related rates and the non-equivalent control series involved total and non-alcohol-related rates. Based on a controlled interrupted time-series design using Bayesian structural time-series models, effects of the laws on alcohol-related road traffic outcome rates were evaluated. After implementation of these laws, the alcohol-related road traffic crash rate decreased by 14.3% (95% credible interval [CrI] −26.8% to −1.9%), alcohol-related road traffic injury rate by 17.6% (95% CrI −31.6% to −3.8%), and alcohol-related minor road traffic injury rate by 20.2% (95% CrI –32.4% to −7.7%). Alcohol-related road traffic death and severe injury rates also decreased more than the declining trends in the pre-period, but reduced non-significantly by 15.0% (95% CrI −47.2% to 17.3%) and 9.9% (95% CrI –33.9% to 14.5%), respectively. The mixed effectiveness of Korea’s new drunk-driving laws on alcohol-related road traffic outcomes suggests that additional strategies are necessary to consistently and effectively reduce alcohol-related road traffic outcomes. More research is needed on ways to enhance the effectiveness of drunk-driving laws.}

However, the existing studies have some limitations: (1) The existing studies only considered one aspect of macro factors and constructed models based on a few data samples. (2) The methods commonly used cannot address the non-linear relationship or calculate the feature importance. The findings obtained from such models may be limited and biased. To address the limitations, this study proposes a BO-CV-XGBoost framework to explore the macro factors related to traffic fatality rate classes based on a high-dimensional dataset that fully considers the impact of multi-factor interaction with adequate data samples. The proposed framework is applied to a dataset in the US. 453 county-level macro factors are collected from various data sources, covering ten macro aspects, including topography, transportation, etc. The optimized BO-CV-XGBoost model obtains the best classification performance with an AUC of 0.8977 and an accuracy of 85.02%. Compared with other methods, the proposed model has superiority on fatality rate classification. Ten macro factors are identified, including ‘Current-dollar GDP’, ‘highway miles per person’, etc. The ten factors contain four aspects of information, including economics, transportation, education, and medical condition. Geographic information system (GIS) techniques are further used for spatial analysis of the identified macro factors. Therefore, targeted and effective measures are accordingly proposed to prevent traffic fatalities and improve road safety}

Crash data from police will undoubtedly play a role in decision-making. This research evaluated the data quality of text narratives in police reports on bicycle crashes. The aims were to identify situations in which police officers wrote more detail in the narrative text, investigate if longer reports translate to more in-depth crash descriptions, examine the extent to which narrative texts cover details useful for those charged with bicycle safety. This is a 4-year retrospective cohort study of vehicle-vs-bicycle crashes that occurred between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2012, in Boston, Massachusetts (USA). Police reports were matched with the Pedestrian and Bicycle Crash Analysis Tool (PBCAT) to measure how much information was captured and when reports were more likely to capture more information. Police reports only captured most information in one area of the standardized form (Crash Typing), with average total missingness of over 75%. Longer reports did reduce the amount of missingness, and officers were more likely to write longer reports when they were on the crash site, when there was an injury, when the crash involved an extended car door, and during the day. A 100% increase in the report’s words was associated with a four-percentage point reduction in PBCAT missingness. While longer reports result in less missingness when measured against the standardized crash form, the average report still misses most of the information that the form would capture. We recommend that police departments adopt a standardized form to facilitate information capture at the scene of bicycle-vehicle crashes.}

However, existing aggressive driving behavior prediction methods are not advanced in a compelling of characterizing the driver's intention among a large set of attributes and describing the random process among time-varying transversion. To address this, this paper proposes a prediction method, which is structured with a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and attention-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network. HMM is applied to extract the driver's intention which leads to aggressive driving behavior; attention-based LSTM networks are applied in the multivariate-temporal aggressive driving behavior prediction. The method input uses panel data which contains observations about different cross-sections across time. In the case study, the model was trained based on the Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study data. After comparing with other deep learning methods and normal LSTM, results show the proposed method provides good performance for aggressive driving behavior prediction (Mean of Accuracy = 80%), especially with the 2-sec time interval applied (Training Accuracy = 82% and Validation Accuracy = 84%). Also, the result shows that the attention mechanism can improve the result's interpretability, and using the driver’s intentions as input can enhance the model accuracy. This method for predicting aggressive driving behavior that combines driver's intention, variable contribution sorting, and time-series processing. This method can be used in real-world applications for improving driving safety with the applications in the Advanced Driver Assistance Systems.}

abstract = {Young drivers, aged 17–25 years, are more likely than other age groups to access social interactive technologies (e.g., Snapchat, Facebook) on their smartphones while driving. Many of these young drivers do so in a concealed manner, thereby diverting their eyes from the road for extended periods and increasing their crash risk. In accordance with previous research, an extended Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was applied in this survey study to investigate psychosocial predictors of young drivers’ intention, and behaviour, of responding to social interactive technology on a smartphone in a concealed manner. Participants (N = 154) resided in Australia, were aged 17–25 years, owned a provisional or an open licence, and owned a smartphone. Participants completed two online surveys administered 1-week apart. The first survey measured intention and assessed the TPB standard constructs of attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioural control, as well as the additional constructs of anticipated action regret, anticipated inaction regret, and problematic mobile phone usage. The first survey also assessed whether there were any differences in the salient beliefs (elicited in a previous study) about smartphone use between high and low intenders to engage in this behaviour. The second survey measured engagement in the behaviour of responding in a concealed manner in the previous week. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed the standard TPB accounted for 69% of variance in intention, and a further 4% was accounted for by the extended constructs. In the final model, all variables, except anticipated inaction regret, were significant predictors of intention. Intention was the only significant predictor of behaviour. A series of MANOVAs found significant differences in the salient belief items between high and low intenders (e.g., high intenders were more likely to believe that friends/peers and other drivers would approve of them engaging in this behaviour). These key findings can be used as focal points for public education messages to persuade young drivers to reduce the frequency of their smartphone use, which is vital to improve road safety for all users.}

abstract = {Car-electric bicycle (e-bike) accidents have been the subject of strong attention due to the widespread usage of e-bikes and a high casualty rate for their riders. Manually conducted accident reconstruction is based on the trial-and-error method with a limited number of parameter combinations, which makes it time-consuming and subjective. This paper aims to develop an intelligent method for accurate, high-efficient reconstruction of accidents involving cars and e-bikes. First, an automatic operation framework, which can drive the MADYMO program and perform results analysis automatically, was built with four multi-objective optimization algorithms available – NSGA-Ⅱ, NCGA, AMGA, and MOPS; The optimization condition was controlled with 12 design variables, 5 objective functions, and 3 constraints. Then, a real e-bike accident with surveillance video was reconstructed through the proposed framework to verify its validity using comparisons of simulated and actual rest positions, initial variables, kinematic response, and head injury. Lastly, the simulation data were used to study the effects of the initial variables on objectives with a multiple linear regression model. The results showed that it took only about 24 h in total for optimization with 480 automatic operations. Optimal conditions were searched at run numbers of 469, 430, 323, and 474 for NSGA-Ⅱ, NCGA, AMGA, and MOPS, respectively. NSGA-Ⅱ had the best performance for e-bike accident reconstruction with average errors of objectives below 5%; Good consistencies for the rider’s kinematic response in three stages after collision were observed between simulations and screenshots from the surveillance video, as well as for velocities between the simulation and those estimated from the surveillance video and for head injury between the simulation and the medical report. In contrast to the subjective trial-and-error method that highly depends on the analyst’s intuition and experience, this intelligent method is based on multi-objective optimization theory, with which results can be optimized in terms of the automatic change of initial variables. All the above comparisons demonstrate that the method is valid for effectively improving efficiency without simultaneously compromising accuracy. This intelligent method, coupling automatic simulation and multi-objective optimization, can also be applied to other accident reconstructions, and the significant order of initial variables’ effects on objectives can provide recommendations for further reconstructions.}

Though previous studies had identified explanatory factors that affect the crash risk of buses, use of considerably imbalanced crash data with excessive zero observations could lead to inaccurate parameter estimation. This study aims to resolve the excess zero problem of disaggregate analysis of bus-involved crashes based on synthetic data using a Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique for panel data (SMOTE-P). Dataset comprising crash, traffic, and road inventory data of 88 road segments in Hong Kong during the period from 2014 to 2017 is used. To assess the data balancing performance, other common data generation approaches such as Random Under-sampling of the Majority Class (RUMC) technique, Cluster-Based Under-Sampling (CBUS), and mixed resampling, are also considered. Random effect Poisson (REP) models based on synthetic data and random effect zero-inflated Poisson (REZIP) model based on original data are estimated. Results indicate that REP model based on synthetic data using SMOTE-P outperforms REZIP model based on original data and REP models based on synthetic data using RUMC, CBUS and mixed approaches, in terms of statistical fit, prediction error, and explanatory factors identified. Results of model estimation based on SMOTE-P suggest that factors including morning peak, evening peak, hourly traffic flow, average lane width, road length, bus stop density, percentage of bus in the traffic stream, and presence of bus priority lane all affect the bus-involved crash frequency. More importantly, this study provides a feasible solution for disaggregate crash analysis with imbalanced panel data.}

This study aims to investigate the similarities and disparities of cycling behaviour among countries with different income levels and cycling prevalence, and the relationships among cyclist demographic characteristics, behaviours and crash involvement. It applies the Cycling Behaviour Questionnaire (CBQ) to measure the behaviour of cyclists in three countries: Australia (high-income, emerging cycling country), China (mid-income, traditional cycling country) and Colombia (low-income, emerging cycling country). A total of 1094 cyclists (Australia 347, China 368, and Colombia 379) with a mean age of 31.8 years completed the online questionnaire. Confirmatory Factor Analysis was used to examine the factorial structure of the CBQ. The results showed that the three-factor CBQ (i.e., Traffic Violations, Errors and Positive Behaviours) had a stable and uniform factorial structure across all three countries. Cyclists reported more frequent positive behaviours than risky behaviours across all three countries. The Australian cyclists reported more positive behaviours and fewer violations than cyclists from the other countries, which is likely to reflect the road environment, policy and enforcement differences. Male cyclists tended to engage in more risky riding than females and reported more crash involvement. Older cyclists reported less risky riding and less involvement in crashes than younger cyclists. Cyclists who rode more often reported more frequent risky riding. The study helps understand the prevalence of risky/positive cyclist behaviours among countries and provides insights for developing systematic countermeasures to improve cycling environment and cyclist safety.}

abstract = {Proactive lane-changing (LC) risk prediction can assist driver’s LC decision-making to ensure driving safety. However, most previous studies on LC risk prediction did not consider the driver’s intention recognition, which made it difficult to guarantee the timeliness and practicability of LC risk prediction. Moreover, the difference in driving risks and its influencing factors between LC to left lane (LCL) and LC to right lane (LCR) have rarely been investigated. To bridge the above research gaps, this study proposes a proactive LC risk prediction framework which integrates the LC intention recognition module and LC risk prediction module. The Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) neural network with time-series input was employed to recognize the driver’s LC intention. The Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) algorithm was then applied to predict the LC risk. Feature importance analysis was lastly conducted to obtain the key features that affect the LC risk. The highD trajectory dataset was used for framework validation. Results show that the recognition accuracy of the driver’s LCL, LCR and lane-keeping (LK) intentions based on the proposed LSTM model are 97%, 96% and 97%, respectively. Meanwhile, the LGBM algorithm outperforms other machine learning algorithms in LC risk prediction. The results from feature importance analysis show that the interaction characteristics of the LC vehicle and its preceding vehicle in the current lane have the greatest impact on the LC risk. The proposed framework could potentially be implemented in advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) or autonomous driving system for improved driving safety.}

Item response theory (IRT) analyses were conducted to identify discrimination parameters indicating which safety climate items were most sensitive to the safety climate level. Discriminative items were identified at both the organization and group levels which can be used to evaluate safety climate and differentiate a high versus low safety climate across groups and organizations in the trucking industry.

This study of linked road crash data aimed to identify co-occurring injuries in multiple injured road users by using a novel application of a data mining technique commonly used in Market Basket Analysis. We expected that some injuries are statistically associated with each other and form Individual-Based Injury Patterns (IBIPs) and further that specific road users are associated with certain IBIPs. First, a new injury taxonomy was developed through a four-step process to allow the use of injury data recorded from either of the two major dictionaries used to document anatomical injury. Then data from the Swedish Traffic Accident Data Acquisition, which includes crash circumstances from the police and injury information from hospitals, was analysed for the years 2011 to 2017. The injury data was analysed using the Apriori algorithm to identify statistical association between injuries (IBIP). Each IBIP were then used as the outcome variable in logistic regression modelling to identify associations between specific road user types and IBIPs. A total of 48,544 individuals were included in the analysis of which 36,480 (75.1%) had a single injury category recorded and 12,064 (24.9%) were considered multiply injured. The data mining analysis identified 77 IBIPs in the multiply injured sample and 16 of these were associated with only one road user type. IBIPs and their relation to road user type are one step on the journey towards developing a tool to better understand and quantify injury severity and thereby improve the evidence-base supporting prioritisation of road safety countermeasures.}

This study aims to identify the daily car-following behaviors on urban surface roads and urban expressways that have the most influence on rear-end crashes and near-crashes (CNC). Two months of naturalistic driving study data were used to investigate the daily car-following behavior of 54 drivers. A paired t-test and a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test were conducted to find the differences in behaviors on the two road types, and basic Poisson regression and Poisson hurdle regression models were used to explore significant risk factors. Results revealed that (1) drivers’ longitudinal vehicle control, time control, and emergency behaviors are significantly different on urban surface roads and urban expressways; (2) for surface roads, three key influencing factors were ranked, in descending order, as the standard deviation of relative speed, percentage of time gap less than 1 s, and maximum acceleration; (3) for expressways, four key factors were ranked: minimum time gap, maximum deceleration, percentage of TTC less than 5 s, and the percentage of large positive jerk. The knowledge achieved on risky daily driving behaviors can be applied to training drivers to improve safe practices, assist insurance companies in creating usage-based insurance strategies, and support driver assistant systems design.}

abstract = {Most research concerned with cyclists’ safety has been focused on the crash risk (i.e. their objective safety). However, there has been a growing interest in the perceived level of this risk (i.e. the subjective safety of cyclists). Crash risk and subjective risk perception in urban cycling appear to be mostly well aligned. For example, reduced speed limits have been found to reduce both objective and subjective risks (although there is also evidence for some incongruences). This absolute number of incidents could be misleading, as it does not account for potential differences in cycling volume (i.e. cyclists are likely to prefer streets with reduced speed limits). Thus, it may be important to adjust the absolute number of incidents relative number to the local cycling volume. In this research, we investigate the relation of cycling crashes and subjective risk perception (operationalized through reports from a crowd-sourcing project) for different types of cycling infrastructure and different speed limits, while accounting for the local cycling volume. We find that the absolute number of VGI reports and crashes can be misleading: whereas the absolute incident numbers, for example, suggest few benefits of cycling lanes and tracks, adjusting for the cycling volume reveals an increase of both objective and subjective safety as compared to streets without cycling infrastructure. We also identify situations where cyclists apparently underestimate the crash risk (i.e. on cycleways opposing the cars’ traveling direction, and at streets with a speed limit of 30 km/h intersecting streets with higher speed limits). Additional research is required to understand the sources of these discrepancies, and how to make cyclists aware of them.}

Building on the Empirical Bayes approach, the objective of this study was to propose a framework to accommodate unobserved heterogeneity in before-after countermeasure evaluation. In particular, this study has proposed a simulation-based Empirical Bayes approach by applying the panel random parameters negative binomial model with parameterized overdispersion (PRNB-PO) to evaluate the effectiveness of engineering treatments. The proposed framework has been tested for the wide centerline treatment (WCLT) on rural two-lane two-way highways in Australia. The empirical analysis included 511 km of WCLT treated highways in a before-after evaluation within a time period of 2010 – 2018 and 430 km of reference sites in Queensland, Australia. The PRNB-PO models outperformed the traditional negative binomial models in terms of goodness-of-fit and prediction performance for total injury crashes, and fatal and serious injury (FSI) crashes. The simulation-based Empirical Bayes approach using the PRNB-PO model resulted in more precise estimates of crash modification factors than the standard Empirical Bayes approach. The WCLT is found to result in significant reductions in total injury crashes by 28.21% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 22.92 – 33.50%), FSI crashes by 13.90% (95% CI = 6.99 – 20.81%), and head-on crashes by 25.45% (95% CI = 14.87 – 36.03%). Overall, WCLT is an effective engineering treatment and should be considered a low-cost countermeasure on rural two-lane two-way highways.}

This paper proposes a method for real-time evaluation of road safety, in which traffic states and conflicts are combined to explore the internal relationship based on high-resolution trajectory data. In order to assess the real-time traffic safety at a lane level, the trajectory data of the HighD dataset from Germany are utilized to collect lane-based dataset. A surrogate safety measure, time-to-collision (TTC) index, is used for the conflict identification. A binary logistic regression model is employed to quantify the relationship between traffic states and conflicts. Moreover, machine learning methods, including support vector machine, decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting decision tree, are applied for real-time evaluation. A total of 24 models are trained using the selected four classifier algorithms, and random forest achieves the best performance with 0.85 of the overall accuracy. The results show that the conflict risk can be well estimated by the proposed method. The findings of this study contribute to the high-precision evaluation of real-time traffic safety and the development of proactive safety management.}

Although distraction has been identified as a contributing factor to pedestrian crashes at railway crossings, only limited research is available regarding the prevalence of this behaviour occurring at railway level crossings. It is, therefore, essential to better understand distraction prevalence at railway crossings to support the use of countermeasures to improve safety outcomes. We conducted field observations at a railway crossing in Brisbane, Australia and its adjacent road intersection to gauge the prevalence of distracted pedestrians. Overall, 585 pedestrians were observed and video recorded during the daytime. The video recordings were coded to estimate the prevalence of distraction behaviour that road users engaged in, factors that affected these proportions, and dynamic changes in behaviour. Compliance with signals was also analysed. We found distraction behaviours such as talking and looking at the mobile screen (41.9%) while walking to be prevalent and affected by age. Highly distractive tasks were found to be less commonplace at the railway crossing, accounting for 3% of the observations. Still, pedestrians at the railway crossing engaged in these highly distractive tasks on their phones for a much longer period of time. While most non-compliances (with traffic lights) occurred among attentive pedestrians and are likely to be intentional, non-compliances by distracted pedestrians were also observed, highlighting that distraction can lead to unsafe decisions or lack of decisions that result in unsafe behaviours. Finally, distraction was found to be a dynamic phenomenon as a few pedestrians stopped engaging in distractive tasks once they reached the crossing, while others engaged in more distractive tasks once they were on the road or crossing. Our study shows that pedestrian distraction is a prevalent issue at railway crossings and future research is required to further understand and mitigate this changing behaviour.}

abstract = {Introduction
Distracted driving has been well researched, however the comparison between different age-gender groups on the impact of distracted driving has not been explored. Most crash analysis research does not distinguish driver responsibility, so the role that distractions has in at-fault crashes is unknown. Without distinguishing at-fault crashes from all-cause crashes, distracted driving's detrimental effects could be underestimated.
Objective
This study aims to systematically assess the risk of at-fault crashes associated with different sources of distraction among six groups by driver age (Teens 16–19, Adults 20–64, Seniors 65+) and gender.
Methods
Crashes where a study participant was deemed at fault were identified using human expert annotated variables from the Strategic Highway Research Program 2 (SHRP2) Naturalistic Driving Study dataset. Generalized linear mixed models were performed to assess the adjusted odds ratios of 10 distraction types associated with the at-fault crashes while controlling for environmental factors.
Results
The main findings are (1) The highest contributing distraction types in at-fault crashes were In-Cabin Objects, Mobile Device, External Scenes, and In-Vehicle Information Systems (IVIS) as indicated by their influence on multiple age-gender groups and the magnitude of odds ratios; (2) Teens and adults were more distraction-prone than seniors, although seniors had the greatest at-fault crash risks associated with In-Cabin Objects, Mobile Device, and IVIS; (3) Distractions impacted females and males similarly; (4) At-fault crashes were more likely to have the significant distraction types present than all-cause crashes.
Conclusion
This study adds to the limited literature on at-fault crashes particularly as it explores the role of driver demographics and distracted driving. Analyzing the risks of distracted driving by age-gender group shows that specific activities can be riskier for a certain population. The effects of distractions may be overlooked without fault determination. Distractions by external scenes, in-vehicle technologies, and in-cabin objects should not be overlooked, in addition to mobile device use.}

abstract = {Despite the countless benefits derived from motorcycle usage, it has become a significant public health concern, particularly in developing countries, due to the plateauing number of fatal/serious injuries associated with them. Although it has been well documented that the frequency and fatality rates of intersection-related motorcycle crashes are high, little research efforts have been made to explore the contributory factors influencing motorcycle-involved crashes at these locations. Interestingly, no study has investigated the latent patterns and chains of factors that simultaneously contribute to the injury severity sustained by motorcycle crash casualties at intersections under different traffic control conditions in developing countries. Since motorcycles are mostly used as taxis in developing countries, it is imperative to consider the injury severity sustained by all crash casualties in the motorcycle safety analysis. This study bridges the research gap by employing a plausible data mining tool to explore hidden rules associated with motorcycle crash casualty injury severity outcomes at both signalized and non-signalized intersections in Ghana's most densely populated region, Accra, using three-year crash data spanning 2016–2018. Besides, a binary logit regression model was also employed to explore the impact of crash factors on casualty severity outcomes using the same dataset. The results from both analysis techniques were consistent; however, the data mining technique provided chains of factors which provided additional insights into the groups of factors that collectively influence the casualty injury severity outcomes. From the rule discovery results, while full license status, daytime/daylight, and shoulder presence increased the risk of fatal injuries at signalized intersections, factors such as inattentiveness, good road surface, nighttime, shoulder absence, and young rider were highly likely to increase casualty fatalities at non-signalized intersections. By controlling all or some of these risk factors, the level of injury severity on the roadways could be reduced. Based on the findings, we provide enforcement, education, and engineering-based recommendations to help improve motorcycle safety.}

abstract = {Objective
Fatigue Risk Management Systems (FRMS) are a data-driven set of management practices for identifying and managing fatigue-related safety risks. This approach also considers sleep and work time, and is based on ongoing risk assessment and monitoring. This narrative review addresses the effectiveness of FRMS, as well as barriers and enablers in the implementation of FRMS. Furthermore, this review draws on the literature to provide evidence-based policy guidance regarding FRMS implementation.
Methods
Seven databases were drawn on to identify relevant peer-reviewed literature. Relevant grey literature was also reviewed based on the authors’ experience in the area. In total, 2129 records were screened based on the search strategy, with 231 included in the final review.
Results
Few studies provide an evidence-base for the effectiveness of FRMS as a whole. However, FRMS components (e.g., bio-mathematical models, self-report measures, performance monitoring) have improved key safety and fatigue metrics. This suggests FRMS as a whole are likely to have positive safety outcomes. Key enablers of successful implementation of FRMS include organisational and worker commitment, workplace culture, and training.
Conclusions
While FRMS are likely to be effective, in organisations where safety cultures are insufficiently mature and resources are less available, these systems may be challenging to implement successfully. We propose regulatory bodies consider a hybrid model of FRMS, where organisations could choose to align with tight hours of work (compliance) controls. Alternatively, where organisational flexibility is desired, a risk-based approach to fatigue management could be implemented.}

As the interest in AV deployment increases, there is an increasing need to assess and understand the expected implications of AVs on traffic safety. Until recently, most of the literature has been based on either survey questionnaires, simulation analysis, virtual reality, or simulation to assess the safety benefits of AVs. Although few studies have used AV crash data, vulnerable road users (VRUs) have not been a topic of interest. Therefore, this study uses crash narratives from four-year (2017–2020) of AV crash data collected from California to explore the direct and indirect involvement of VRUs. The study applied text network and compared the text classification performance of four classifiers - Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and Neural Network (NN) and associated performance metrics to attain the objective. It was found that out of 252 crashes, VRUs were, directly and indirectly, involved in 23 and 12 crashes, respectively. Among VRUs, bicyclists and scooterists are more likely to be involved in the AV crashes directly, and bicyclists are likely to be at fault, while pedestrians appear more in the indirectly involvements. Further, crashes that involve VRUs indirectly are likely to occur when the AVs are in autonomous mode and are slightly involved minor damages on the rear bumper than the ones that directly involve VRUs. Additionally, feature importance from the best performing classifiers (RF and NN) revealed that crosswalks, intersections, traffic signals, movements of AVs (turning, slowing down, stopping) are the key predictors of the VRUs-AV related crashes. These findings can be helpful to AV operators and city planners.}

abstract = {Pedestrian fatalities have increased in the U.S. with the largest increase being observed on urban arterials and away from intersections. Rectangular Rapid Flashing Beacon (RRFB) has been widely implemented as a safety countermeasure to improve driver awareness and visibility of pedestrians, especially for midblock crosswalks. Studies show that drivers are more likely to yield to pedestrians at crosswalks with an RRFB. These studies are often based on a binary outcome of whether or not drivers yield to pedestrians. Nevertheless, it is also important to consider the drivers’ deceleration behavior as a dynamic process at these crosswalks and the impact of pedestrians being present or not. Understanding this dynamic behavior and the related circumstances can provide information on the design of alerting systems that help drivers make more appropriate decisions at these crosswalks to avoid a vehicle–pedestrian crash. This study examined this research topic using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and data from a naturalistic study. More specifically, four HMMs were applied to the naturalistic brake and jerk data from the Safety Pilot Model Deployment (SPMD) program given drivers’ intention to slow down, the RRFB activation status, and the presence of pedestrians. The time-based data sequence was converted to distance-based through a moving window to enhance result comparison and interpretation. Grid-search was used to select the best moving window parameters and the optimal number of hidden states. This study confirmed the high compliance at an activated RRFB when pedestrians were present. Even without pedestrians, one in five traversals showed drivers slowing down to less than 8.94 m/s (20 mph) within 35 m of the crosswalk. Model results further indicate that drivers started braking as far back as 180 m before the crosswalk and stopped braking from 70 m before the crosswalk at an activated RRFB without pedestrians. When there were pedestrians, drivers would start braking 20 to 30 m later but would brake more firmly and for longer. Finally, drivers were not likely to brake or decelerate when RRFB was off and no pedestrians were present.}

The same reverse U-curve relationship was also observed between per-head income and other road injury-related variables, including road deaths, road injuries, as well as road deaths to road injuries ratio. Evidence showed that motorcycles and passenger cars are the dominant vehicle modes and contributed significantly to global road deaths. The main objective of this study is to examine the relationship between the motorcycle deaths to passenger car deaths (MDC) ratio and per-head Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Examining the relationship between the MDC ratio and GDP per capita can be effective in understanding the relative change between motorcycle and passenger car deaths at different economic development stages, as well as identifying appropriate preventive measures. We apply a panel linear regression analysis on a panel of 38 countries over the period 1965–2013. Result demonstrated that there is a reverse U-curve relationship between the MDC ratio and the logarithm of GDP per capita. This implies that, at lower levels of GDP per capita, motorcycle deaths were more prevalent than passenger car deaths, whereas as the level of GDP per capita rises, passenger car deaths became relatively prevalent than motorcycle deaths. Moreover, there is a reverse U-shaped relationship between motorcycle ownership to passenger car ownership ratio (MPC) and the MDC ratio, while a U-shaped relationship exists between relative growth in higher mobility roads as compared to higher accessibility roads (MPA) and the MDC ratio. Based on our results, policies and interventions to reduce motorcycle and passenger car deaths were suggested in the conclusion of the paper.}

Therefore, it is necessary to devise systems to prevent accidents in advance and respond proactively, using potential risky situations as one of the surrogate safety measurements. This study introduces a new concept of a pedestrian safety system that combines the field and the centralized processes. The system can warn of upcoming risks immediately in the field and improve the safety of risk-frequent areas by assessing the safety levels of roads without actual collisions. In particular, this study focuses on the latter by introducing a new analytical framework for a crosswalk safety assessment with various behaviors of vehicles/pedestrians and environmental features. We obtain these behavioral features from actual traffic video footages in the city with complete automatic processing. The proposed framework mainly analyzes these behaviors in multi-dimensional perspectives by constructing a data cube structure, which combines the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based predictive collision risk (PCR) estimation model and the on-line analytical processing (OLAP) operations. From the PCR estimation model, we categorize the severity of risks as four levels; “relatively safe,” “caution,” “warning,” and “danger,” and apply the proposed framework to assess the crosswalk safety with behavioral features. With the proposed framework, the various descriptive results are harvested, but we aim at conducting analysis based on two scenarios in our analytic experiments; the movement patterns of vehicles and pedestrians by road environment and the relationships between risk levels and car speeds. Consequently, the proposed framework can support decision-makers (e.g., urban planners, safety administrators) by providing the valuable information to improve pedestrian safety for future accidents, and it can help us better understand cars’ and pedestrians’ proactive behavior near the crosswalks. In order to confirm the feasibility and applicability of the proposed framework, we implement and apply it to actual operating CCTVs in Osan City, Republic of Korea.}

In straight-forward situations where the hazard appears abruptly from behind an obstruction (abrupt onset), hazard onset is typically defined as when the hazard is first visible to the motorist. In contrast, in scenarios where there is no clearly defined point of entry (gradual onset), and the potential hazard gradually transitions to an immediate hazard, the onset point is more ambiguous. In this study, a reasonable hazard onset was proposed for measuring RTs of motorcycle riders to gradual-onset hazards, following which the RTs to abrupt- and gradual-onset hazards were determined and compared. A study on motorcycle rider RTs was conducted in Singapore in which a sample of young male adults (licensed riders with more than one year’s effective riding experience, and unlicensed subjects) were equipped with eye tracking glasses and were presented with two pairs of abrupt-/ gradual-onset hazard scenarios on a simple motorcycle simulator. Their RTs were recorded. Initial deviation from the straight path (start of turning manoeuvre) of the intruding hazard vehicle was determined to be a more appropriate onset (start point when measuring RTs) for gradual-onset hazards when compared with referencing the onset against travel lane incursions. Participants generally took longer to respond to gradual-onset hazards than abrupt-onset hazards. Unlicensed subjects tended to underperform relative to licensed riders. The findings from this study contribute to the literature in the relatively novel field of motorcycle RTs and should be of interest to crash reconstructionists as well road safety professionals in designing road operations.}

The Pedestrian Behaviour Scale (PBS) is a self-report questionnaire that distinguishes five dimensions of pedestrian behaviour: violations, errors, lapses, aggressive behaviours and positive behaviours. This study aimed to meet three objectives: to trace the development of the PBS worldwide from 1997 to 2021, to report on its varied uses and to analyse the scientific validation of the different dimensions of pedestrian behaviour reflected by the PBS and its derivatives.
Design/methodology
In this systematic literature review, we selected all works that cited the 2013 founding study of the PBS as well as all publications that cited the 2017 US validation of PBS which was frequently replicated around the world. We conducted an online database search using Web of Science, Google Scholar, ResearchGate and PubMed. After excluding duplicates, 116 studies were identified. A total of 30 studies were selected to meet our first two objectives and 14 studies were selected to meet our third objective.
Results
Over time, the PBS has undergone many changes. Overall, we found differences in the scientific validation of this questionnaire depending on the version used, the validation tests performed and the population studied. The original version of the PBS and its Turkish adaptation proved most appropriate for assessing the transgressions dimension. The American version of the PBS proved a suitable alternative but it is more suited to assessing the two independent dimensions of violations and errors. The Chinese version of the PBS (CPBS) proved unsuitable for assessing the lapses dimension, while the original version of the PBS emerged as the best option for assessing aggressive behaviours. The positive behaviour dimension presented many validation difficulties but its assessment by the CPBS seems to be the most appropriate option.
Conclusion
As no systematic review of the PBS has been conducted before, researchers can now make an informed choice of methodology quickly and be guided by our recommendations regarding the use and possible improvements of the different validated versions.}

abstract = {Numerous evaluation studies have been conducted on a variety of road safety measures. However, the issue of treatment heterogeneity, defined as the variation in treatment effects, has rarely been investigated before. This paper contributes to the literature by introducing generalized random forests (GRF) for estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) in road safety analysis. GRF has high functional flexibility and is able to search for complex treatment heterogeneity. We first perform a series of simulation experiments to compare GRF with three causal methods that have been used in road safety studies, i.e., outcome regression method, propensity score method, and doubly robust estimation method. The simulation results suggest that GRF is superior to these three methods in terms of model specification, especially with the existence of nonlinearity and nonadditivity. On the other hand, a large dataset is required for accurate GRF estimation. Then we conduct a case study on the UK’s speed camera program. Our results indicate significant reductions in the number of road accidents at speed camera sites. And the heterogeneity in treatment effects is found to be statistically significant. We further consider the associations between the baseline accident records, traffic volume, local socio-economic characteristics, and the safety effects of speed cameras. In general, the effect of speed cameras is larger at the sites with more baseline accident records, higher traffic volume, and in more densely-populated and deprived areas. Several policy suggestions are provided based on these findings. The evaluation of HTEs likely offers more comprehensive information to local authorities and policy makers, and improves the performance of speed camera programs. Moreover, GRF can be a promising approach for revealing treatment effect heterogeneity in road safety analysis.}

abstract = {The total number of road crashes in Europe is decreasing, but the number of crashes involving cyclists is not decreasing at the same rate. When cars and bicycles share the same lane, cars typically need to overtake them, creating dangerous conflicts—especially on rural roads, where cars travel much faster than cyclists. In order to protect cyclists, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) are being developed and introduced to the market. One of them is a forward collision warning (FCW) system that helps prevent rear-end crashes by identifying and alerting drivers of threats ahead. The objective of this study is to assess the relative safety benefit of a behaviour-based (BB) FCW system that protects cyclists in a car–to–cyclist overtaking scenario. Virtual safety assessments were performed on crashes derived from naturalistic driving data. A series of driver response models was used to simulate different driver reactions to the warning. Crash frequency in conjunction with an injury risk model was used to estimate the risk of cyclist injury and fatality. The virtual safety assessment estimated that, compared to no FCW, the BB FCW could reduce cyclists’ fatalities by 53–96% and serious injuries by 43–94%, depending on the driver response model. The shorter the driver’s reaction time and the larger the driver’s deceleration, the greater the benefits of the FCW. The BB FCW also proved to be more effective than a reference FCW based on the Euro NCAP standard test protocol. The findings of this study demonstrate the BB FCW’s great potential to avoid crashes and reduce injuries in car–to–cyclist overtaking scenarios, even when the driver response model did not exceed a comfortable rate of deceleration. The results suggest that a driver behaviour model integrated into ADAS collision threat algorithms can provide substantial safety benefits.}

It poses security challenges in the form of cyber-attacks, prompting rigorous cybersecurity measures. There is a lack of knowledge on the anticipated cause-effect relationships and mechanisms of CAVs cybersecurity and the possible system behaviour, especially the unintended consequences. Therefore, this study aims to develop a conceptual System Dynamics (SD) model to analyse cybersecurity in the complex, uncertain deployment of CAVs. Specifically, the SD model integrates six critical avenues and maps their respective parameters that either trigger or mitigate cyber-attacks in the operation of CAVs using a systematic theoretical approach. These six avenues are: i) CAVs communication framework, ii) secured physical access, iii) human factors, iv) CAVs penetration, v) regulatory laws and policy framework, and iv) trust—across the CAVs-industry and among the public. Based on the conceptual model, various system archetypes are analysed. “Fixes that Fail”, in which the upsurge in hacker capability is the unintended natural result of technology maturity, requires continuous efforts to combat it. The primary mitigation steps are human behaviour analysis, knowledge of motivations and characteristics of CAVs cyber-attackers, CAVs users and Original Equipment Manufacturers education. “Shifting the burden”, where policymakers counter the perceived cyber threats of hackers by updating legislation that also reduces CAVs adaptation by imitations, indicated the need for calculated regulatory and policy intervention. The “limits to success” triggered by CAVs penetration increase the defended hacks to establish regulatory laws, improve trust, and develop more human analysis. However, it may also open up caveats for cyber-crimes and alert that CAVs deployment to be alignment with the intended goals for enhancing cybersecurity. The proposed model can support decision-making and training and stimulate the roadmap towards an optimized, self-regulating, and resilient cyber-safe CAV system.}

However, existing studies only focused on predicting the likelihood of crashes leading to secondary crashes without considering the likelihood of the occurrence of secondary crashes. In addition, previous studies did not consider the real-time implementation of secondary crash likelihood prediction models and included too many features that were not available in real-time. A real-time secondary crash likelihood prediction model aims to predict the likelihood of secondary crashes in a short period (e.g., 5–10 min) and update every minute. The main objective of this paper is to develop a machine learning model to predict secondary crash likelihood in real-time. Two XGBoost models were developed for predicting the likelihood of crashes leading to secondary crashes and the likelihood of the occurrence of secondary crashes, respectively. A hybrid model was proposed to combine the results from the two developed models. Results indicated that the proposed hybrid model significantly improved the accuracy of secondary crash likelihood prediction. The proposed model has the potential to be applied in proactive traffic safety management system and prevent the occurrence of secondary crashes. Moreover, experimental results suggested that several features related to real-time traffic flow conditions were crucial for predicting secondary crash likelihood, such as the average traffic volume and average occupancy.}

However, the actual operation state of a train is composed of a variety of modes and is disturbed by several known or unknown factors, for which an accurate estimator is required. Hence, in this paper, a train multi-mode model considering the actual operation environment is established, and a train state estimation method based on multi-sensor parallel fusion filter is proposed. In the parallel fusion filter, the current mode of train is determined by the proposed sliding window error and voting mechanism, and the global filter are constituted by the local filters, which are fused by linear-weighted summation. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in estimating the train's state. It is worth noting that even if monitoring data are missing or are abnormal, the state estimation accuracy of the proposed technique still meets the requirements of a real system, and the effectiveness and robustness of the method can be verified.}

The system has two main functions: monitoring traffic data and then using the data to assess crash risk through a real-time crash prediction model (RTCPM). When the risk is high, the system triggers VSL control to restore traffic conditions to normal. The study addresses several weaknesses in existing VSL-based real-time safety interventions. Existing models are not widely applicable due to varying detector spacing among different freeways, and even within a study area. Therefore, with the existing detector spacing as an input, a cell transmission model (CTM) is used to simulate traffic states for the desired cell size. A dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) is used for modeling in the RTCPM. The proposed CTM model is then modified to allow VSL control. Whereas existing studies selected various VSL strategies from a predefined list, we employ a deep Q-network, which is a reinforcement learning-based machine learning algorithm, for the VSL control. Two busy segments of the Tokyo Metropolitan Expressway were used as the study area. After several iterations, our proposed real-time system reduced the crash risk by 19%.}

This study focuses on pedestrian collision warning (PCW) as an intensive function of the ADAS, which operates when a vehicle is at a collision risk with a vulnerable road user (VRU). Although several studies have been conducted on surrogate safety measures for crashes against VRUs, none of these studies used real-world CV data with collision warning information. Thus, the current study aims to i) develop a safety performance function (SPF) for crashes against VRUs at unsignalized intersections, where the PCW information was acquired using connected advanced probe vehicles (APVs), and ii) assess the effectiveness of a traffic-safety treatment implemented at an unsignalized intersection based on the developed SPF. In particular, this study proposes a two-step empirical Bayesian estimation based on the SPF model (2-step EB-SPF) to consider the issue regarding the limited number and vehicle types of APVs that can obtain PCW information. Based on the APV data, the vehicle–VRU crash-count negative binomial (NB) models were separately estimated using the actual PCW incidence rate and the EB estimate of PCW incidence rate, respectively. Although the actual PCW incidence rate was not statistically significant in the former model, the EB estimate of the PCW incidence rate was statistically significant and positively related to the crash count in the latter model. Moreover, a traffic-safety treatment was implemented at an unsignalized intersection and subsequently assessed as a case study based on the estimated 2-step EB-SPF model. Consequently, the model with the EB estimate of PCW incidence rate revealed that the vehicle–VRU crash risk was reduced by approximately 70%, and it was statistically significant at the 99% confidence level, which diminished the confidence interval in comparison to the model without the PCW incidence rate. Thus, the APV data including collision warning information can improve the estimation accuracy of determining the effect of the traffic-safety treatment, which can considerably contribute toward traffic safety assessment, especially for short after-treatment periods such as that prevailing in this case study.}

Due to the complexity of the takeover process, it is important to develop interfaces to support good takeover performance. Multimodal displays have been proposed as a candidate for the design of takeover requests (TORs), but many questions remain unanswered regarding the effectiveness of this approach. This study investigated the effects of takeover signal direction (ipsilateral vs. contralateral), lead time (4 vs. 7 s), and modality (uni-, bi-, and trimodal combinations of visual, auditory, and tactile signals) on automated vehicle takeover performance. Twenty-four participants rode in a simulated SAE Level 3 vehicle and performed a series of takeover tasks when presented with a TOR. Overall, single and multimodal signals with a tactile component were correlated with the faster takeover and information processing times, and were perceived as most useful. Ipsilateral signals showed a marginally significant benefit to takeover times compared to contralateral signals. Finally, a shorter lead time was associated with faster takeover times, but also poorer takeover quality. Findings from this study can inform the design of in-vehicle information and warning systems for next-generation transportation.}

abstract = {Background
One major challenge faced by neighborhood-level bicycle safety analysis is the lack of complete and reliable exposure data for the entire area under investigation. Although the conventional travel-diary surveys, together with the emerging smartphone fitness applications and bike-sharing systems, provide straightforward and valuable opportunities to estimate territory-wide bicycle activities, the obtained ridership suffers inherently from underreporting.
Methods
We introduced the Bayesian simultaneous-equation model as a sound methodological alternative here to address the uncertainty arising from incomplete exposure data when modeling bicycle crashes. The proposed method was successfully fitted to a crowdsourced dataset of 792 bicycle–motor vehicle (BMV) crashes aggregated from 209 neighborhoods over a 3-year period in Hong Kong.
Results
Our analysis empirically demonstrated the bias due to omission of activity-based exposure measures or to the direct use of cycling distance extracted from the travel-diary survey without correcting for incompleteness. By modeling bicycle activities and the frequency of BMV crashes simultaneously, we also provided new evidence that an expansion of bicycle infrastructure was likely associated with a significant increase in cycling levels and a substantial reduction in the risk of BMV crashes, despite a slight increase in the absolute number of BMV crashes.
Conclusions
Our approach is promising in adjusting for the uncertainty in raw exposure data, extrapolating the missing exposure values, and untangling the linkage among built environment, bicycle activities, and the frequency of BMV crashes within a unified framework. To promote safer cycling, designated facilities should be provided to consecutively separate cyclists from motor vehicles.}

Method
Based on anonymous mobile phone location and crash report data in New York City, this study attempts to provide some new insights by using survival analysis (the hazard function approach) to explore the effects of human mobility changes due to the pandemic on crashes that involve injuries and fatalities (of pedestrian, cyclist or motorist).
Results
(1) the increased percentage of people staying at home improves pedestrian and cyclist safety, which adds evidence for making walking and cycling more appealing; (2) the increased percentage of people staying at home raises the likelihood of injuries for motor vehicle drivers, suggesting that it will be critical to monitor the driving behavior and establish new speed limits during the future pandemic waves and in the post-pandemic era as well; (3) non-work trips (e.g., shopping, recreation, personal business, etc.) are positively associated with crash injuries for motor vehicle drivers as well as pedestrian and cyclist; (4) human mobility factors were found not related to crash fatalities; (5) control NPIs implemented increased the motor vehicle drivers’ crash risk.}

The extent of the single bicycle crashes (SBCs) and crash causes are rather well studied. This study expands this knowledge by focusing on differences in injury severity. The aim of the study is to investigate the relationship between injury severity and characteristics of the crash and the cyclist with focus on SBCs. Furthermore, injury risk is calculated for different age classes and sexes, as well as for different purposes of the trip. The results are based on injured cyclists in Sweden (N = 105,836) registered in STRADA, 2010–2019, by both the police and accident and emergency departments (A\&Es), with a special focus on injury severity reported by the A\&Es. Binary logistic regression was applied to analyse how the odds of being severely injured differed for different cyclists and situations. Results from of the National Travel Survey, 2011–2016, were used to study differences in distance travelled with respect to sex, age group and purpose of the trip. Given that the cyclist is injured in an SBC, the results show a higher probability of being severely injured (maximal AIS 3 or more) for cyclists 45 years or older compared to younger cyclists, for males compared to females and for cyclists not wearing a helmet compared to cyclists wearing a helmet. A higher probability for severe injury was also found for crashes occurring during leisure trips compared to work/school trips, crashes occurring during weekdays compared to weekends and crashes at intersections and road stretches compared to pedestrian and cycle paths. Furthermore, the risk of being severely injured in an SBC per km travelled was higher for cyclists aged 45 and older and during a leisure trip.}

abstract = {Real-time crash prediction is a heavily studied area given their potential applications in proactive traffic safety management in which a plethora of statistical and machine learning (ML) models have been developed to predict traffic crashes in real-time. However, one of the fundamental issues relating to the application of these models is spatio-temporal transferability. The present paper attempts to address this gap of knowledge by combining Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and transfer learning to examine the transferability of real-time crash prediction models under an extremely imbalanced data setting. Initially, a baseline model was developed using Deep Neural Network (DNN) with crash and microscopic traffic data collected from M1 Motorway in the UK in 2017. The dataset utilised in the baseline model is naturally imbalanced with 257 crash cases and 16,359,163 non-crash cases. To overcome data imbalance issue, Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) was utilised to generate synthetic crash data. Non-crash data were randomly undersampled due to computational limitations. The calibrated model was then applied to predict traffic crashes for five other datasets obtained from M1 (2018), M4 (2017 \& 2018 separately) and M6 Motorway (2017 \& 2018 separately) by using transfer learning. Model transferability was compared with standalone models and direct transfer from the baseline model. The study revealed that direct transfer is not feasible. However, models become transferable temporally, spatially, and spatio-temporally if transfer learning is applied. The predictability of the transferred models outperformed existing studies by achieving high Area Under Curve (AUC) values ranging between 0.69 and 0.95. The best transferred model can predict nearly 95% crashes with only a 5% false alarm rate by tuning thresholds. Furthermore, the performances of transferred models are on par with or better than the standalone model. The findings of this study proves that transfer learning can improve model transferability under extremely imbalanced settings which helps traffic engineers in developing highly transferable models in future.}

While classical statistical models have limitations in accurately modeling INJ-S, advanced machine learning methods have no apparent equations to prioritize/analyze different contributing factors to predict INJ-S levels. Also, the intercorrelations among the input factors could make the results of a typical sensitivity analysis misleading. Rear-end accidents constitute the most frequent type of traffic accidents; and therefore, their associated INJ-S need more insight investigations. To resolve all these issues, this study presents a sophisticated approach based on a deep learning paradigm combined with a Variance-Based Globa1 Sensitivity Analysis (VB/GSA). The methodology proposes a deep residual neural networks structure that utilizes residual shortcuts (i.e., connections), unlike other neural network architectures. The connections allow the DRNNs to bypass a few layers in the deep network architecture, circumventing the regular training with high accuracy problems. The Monte Carlo simulation with the aid of the trained DRNNs model was conducted to investigate the impact of each explanatory factor on the INJ-S levels based on the VB/GSA. The developed methodology was used to analyze all rear-end accidents in North Carolina from 2010 to 2017. The performance of the developed methodology was evaluated utilizing some selected representative indicators and then compared with the well-known ordered logistic regression (OLR) model. The developed methodology was found to achieve an overall accuracy of 83% and attained a superior performance, as compared with the OLR model.

Likewise, studies using the human capital method tend to underestimate the total socio-economic costs by a factor of two compared to the cost derived from the wtp approach; this gap then reduces substantially when accounting for population density, countries' income levels, and road safety outcomes. Further, the paper stresses the underreporting problem and the inexistence of a mechanism to reasonably account for it in socio-economic costs calculations. The paper concludes by advocating for more studies focusing on low and middle-income countries using a combination of common approaches with other valuation methods.}

abstract = {Traffic crashes are the result of the interaction between human activities and different socio-economic, geographical, and environmental factors, showing a temporal and spatial relationship. The temporal and spatial correlations must be characterized in crash severity studies, for which the geographically and temporally weighted ordered logistic regression (GTWOLR) model is an effective approach. However, existing studies using the GTWOLR model only subjectively selected a type of kernel function and kernel bandwidth, which cannot determine the best expression of the spatiotemporal relationship between crashes. This paper explores the optimal kernel function and kernel bandwidth considering the aforementioned problem to obtain the best GTWOLR model to analyze the crash data based on the crash data of rural highways in Anhui Province, China, from 2014 to 2017. First, the GTWOLR models with Gaussian or Bi-square kernel function and fixed (the spatiotemporal distance remains constant of local sample) or adaptive (the quantity of the local sample is constant) bandwidth are compared. Second, the log-likelihood and Akaike information criterion are used to compare the GTWOLR model with the ordered logistic regression (OLR) model. Finally, the spatial and temporal characteristics of the contributing factors in the best GTWOLR model are analyzed, and corresponding countermeasures for improving traffic safety on rural highways are proposed. Model comparison results reveal that although the difference was insignificant, the Bi-square kernel function with fixed bandwidth (BF)- GTWOLR model has a better goodness of fit than the GTWOLR models with other types of kernel function and bandwidth and the OLR model. The BF-GTWOLR model estimation results showed that eight factors, including pedestrian-vehicle crash, middle-aged driver, hit-and-run, truck, motorcycle, curve, slope and mountainous, passed the non-stationary test, indicating their varying effects on the crash severity across space and over time. As a crash severity modeling approach that effectively quantifies the spatiotemporal relationships in crashes, the BF-GTWOLR model, which adapts to crash data, may have implications for future research. In addition, the findings of this paper can help traffic management departments to propose progressive and targeted policies or countermeasures, so as to reduce the severity of rural highway crashes.}

In recent years, bicycles equipped with child seats have become a popular means of transportation for preschool children in urban areas in Japan. Under such adverse circumstances, it is necessary to conduct more studies and evaluations to prevent traffic accidents and the resulting injuries involving bicycles with children. For accident prevention and damage mitigation, this study mainly aims to understand the kinematic behavior and injury risk of children in collisions involving bicycles equipped with child seats through experiments. First, fall tests were conducted to evaluate the effect of the integrated head restraints (also commonly known as headrests) of child seats. It was confirmed that head restraints can reduce the impact of head collisions with the road surface. Second, side collision tests were conducted between a car and a bicycle equipped with a child seat, and the effects of the seat belt and head restraint of the child seat were investigated. It was shown that the kinematic behavior of the child dummy significantly was changed depending on wearing the seat belt. In the condition that the seat belt was not fastened, the child dummy was ejected out of the child seat while rotating toward the hood after the impact with the front of the car. In contrast, when the seat belt was fastened, the child dummy was restrained in the child seat and moved together with the bicycle from the start of the collision until the complete stop. Thus, it was found that using child seats with head restraints and using seat belts can reduce the risk of injury to children during an impact with the road surface, because the child dummy in the tests impacted the road surface only after the bicycle already had contact with the road surface.}

abstract = {A driving strategy for autonomous vehicles (AVs) that is consistent with human behavior while demonstrating superior performance seems to have a good chance to be accepted by early AV users and be successful in the long run. Most of the past research focused on motion strategies affected by the presence of other vehicles. On the other hand, AV not constrained by other vehicles must select a safe and comfortable speed that is perceived as such by its occupants. This line of research is not well covered by the published work. The baseline speed, which is the speed AVs will follow without interaction with other vehicles, implemented via cruise control (CC) in modern vehicles is a constant speed consistent with speed limits and design speeds. A more advanced strategy of road-limiting speed control (RC) responds to influencing geometric features ahead of the AV’s current position. Neither of the two strategies considers AV occupants’ preferences. The current void in research is particularly obvious for free-flow conditions where baseline speeds must be implemented for extended periods of travel. Although the existing strategies have not been yet evaluated on roadways with demanding alignments and operating in free-flow conditions, the principles on which they are based provide a basis for skepticism if they can be acceptable to AV occupants. This study used the Tongji University driving simulator to evaluate the CC and RC strategies and their potential limitations in free-flow conditions on a mountainous freeway with complex alignments. Human speed-selection behavior was observed among a group of participating drivers. The clustering analysis of the data revealed three distinct driving styles: slow, fast, and consistent. The resulted analytical models provided human-focused road-dependent baseline speed profiles– a key element of the proposed human-like speed control (HC) strategy. The comparison of the existing speed-control strategies CC and RC with the proposed HC confirmed the limitations of the two existing ones if applied to roads with complex alignments. Considerable discrepancies were revealed between the baseline speeds produced with the existing and the proposed ones.}

abstract = {In recent years, pedestrian safety has emerged to be of major concern to selected States in the US and at the national level. With the transition to the mobility of people, pedestrian safety has become more prevalent for governmental agencies to address and prioritize for strategic implementation. It was crucial to address the pedestrian-vehicular conflict within Florida as it was reported as having the highest four pedestrian incident locations in the country. Many pedestrian sidewalks in Florida are not continuous and there is a concern among planners and engineers in the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) that these gaps constitute discontinuity of flow and are potentially posing threats to pedestrian safety. This paper investigates the correlation between pedestrian safety and sidewalk gaps within the Central Florida region. A sidewalk gap is defined as a length of a roadway segment with missing or absent sidewalk between existing sidewalks (before and after) along the same segment. “Missing” sidewalks are locations where the sidewalk is not only absent, but there is a desire to have one constructed or it would be used if it were constructed. The missing sidewalk can be on one side of the road or both sides. A wide array of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) information associated with the sidewalk gaps and the safety data were secured by FDOT. The data included all the Roadway Characteristics Inventory (RCI) within the district. Crash data combined with other geometric design data, traffic data, and census data were used to develop a statistical model. The results showed that absence of sidewalk along roadway segments is one of the main factors that have significant impact on the expected number of pedestrian crashes at a specific location. Other factors included daily traffic volumes, roadway category, specifically along urban two-way divided and undivided arterials with four to six lanes as well as the population within half-mile radius surrounding the crash location. The model results revealed that the Incident Risk Ratio (IRR) of a pedestrian crash along roadways with no sidewalk is 1.67 times greater than the likelihood of a crash with the presence of a sidewalk at 95% Confidence Interval (C.I.). The analysis also concluded that the likelihood of a pedestrian crash per mile along roadways with no sidewalk is three times greater than the likelihood of a crash per mile with the presence of a sidewalk.}

abstract = {Drivers of partially automated vehicles (PAVs) are relieved from parts of the driving tasks allocated to the automated driver. Ironically, these drivers are obligated to continuously monitor the driving task at all times and keep their attention on the roadway. This reduction in the driving task's demands and cognitive workload may encourage drivers to engage with non-driving related tasks (NDRT), which may impair drivers' awareness of the road environment and, as a result, compromise safety. This study examined how engagement with a visual-manual NDRT affects the driving performance of PAV drivers. Thirty-seven participants were randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions in a driving simulator. Each consisted of two simulated drives. The first experimental condition included one drive under manual driving conditions and another under partially automated driving conditions (i.e., L2). Both drives had no NDRT involved. The second experimental condition included one drive under L2 without an NDRT and one drive under L2, including engagement with an NDRT. Participants' eye movements and heart rate were recorded throughout the experiment. Across various measures, the findings showed that under L2 driving conditions, engagement with an NDRT impairs driving performance in two primary aspects: (1) drivers were less aware of road hazards, and (2) their mental workload was higher when they engaged with an NDRT. In addition, the findings reveal that for drivers engaged with an NDRT, the attentional time-sharing strategy between the NDRT and the roadway monitoring task affected the probability of identifying a hazard. This study shows the adverse effects of engagement with an NDRT under L2 driving conditions on driving performance. Future studies should examine different interventions to mitigate these effects, assuring that drivers are constantly aware of the roadway environment.}

Two critical components in the traffic safety analysis process not agreed upon are 1) how the crash distance to a target location is included in the analysis and 2) how crashes are weighted based on crash-related characteristics. For example, the commonly used buffering technique to determine which crashes are associated with a specific target road segment does not associate crashes that are closer to a target road segment with any additional weight, even though it is likely to be more greatly associated with the characteristics of the target location. Additionally, the commonly used equivalent property damage only (EPDO) crash weight method has been found to weigh fatal crashes significantly more than serious injury crashes, even if the difference between the two outcomes was a single factor. This study proposes more robust crash weighting techniques for use in high-risk location identification using an application of a novel horizontal curve dataset. Specifically, a heteroscedastic censored regression approach was used to investigate the impact of different crash proximity weighting techniques and crash severity weighting methods on model outcomes. The results demonstrate that the use of a linear distance weighting factor used in conjunction with the buffering technique as well as a less precise EPDO weighting factor method results in more robust safety analysis outcomes. The improved results have the potential to improve hot spot identification and resource allocation at both the federal and regional levels by employing models that more accurately link specific crash segments with contributing crash characteristics.}

A signal reconstruction method by selecting intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) using hybrid selection criteria is then proposed. Second, novel feature named weighted fractional wavelet packet decomposition energy entropy (WFWPDE) is developed by introducing the idea of fractional calculus and weight to wavelet packet decomposition energy entropy (WDPE). Third, a synchronous optimization strategy is proposed to optimize the weights and hyperparameters of support vector machine (SVM) synchronously. Finally, the superiority and feasibility of the proposed method are verified on field-collected data. By comparing with different fault diagnosis methods, the proposed method performs best on fault diagnosis of train plug doors, with accuracy of 97.87%.}

However, hypoxia conditions in the plateau environment might affect drivers' cognitive and judgment ability, posing potential threats to safe driving. This study analyzed the eye movement behaviors of drivers when faced with traffic hazards in the plateau environment, to examine the impact level of altitude on drivers’ perception and reaction. Nine typical traffic hazard scenarios were investigated at four locations with four different altitudes, including Linzhi, Lhasa, Naqu, and Yanghu Scenic Area based on UC-WIN / ROAD driving simulation software. Then, drivers’ visual search modes were analyzed according to drivers’ eye movement data collected by ASL Mobile Eye monocular eye tracker. As the altitude increased, the drivers’ first fixation time and the average saccade amplitude decreased, while the fixation duration percentage increased. Drivers with fewer years of driving experience had a larger percentage of fixation duration and a smaller saccade amplitude. In addition, a shorter acclimation period also negatively influenced the percentage of fixation time. The increase of altitude would weaken the drivers' visual sensitivity and cognitive processing ability of hazard information, which would reduce drivers' hazard perception skills, and the increase of driving experience might help alleviate such negative impacts to some extent. Based on the visual characteristics of traffic hazard scenarios obtained in this paper, the training of highly accident-prone drivers can be guided specifically to improve their visual search strategies, thereby improving driving safety.}

abstract = {Background
Since 1994, the legal limit of Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) is 0.5 g/L for the general drivers’ population in Belgium. Since 2015, this limit has been lowered to 0.2 g/L for professional drivers. So far, no specific limitation has been adopted for novice drivers in Belgium. Recently, two bills were submitted to the House of Representatives: the first one proposed to impose a zero-limit for every driver, the second one proposed to restrict this zero-limit only to novice drivers.
Objective
The present study evaluated the potential impact of the two bills that aim to reduce the legal BAC limit from 0.5 to zero, either for all drivers or for novice drivers only. We elaborated three scenarios related to the BAC categories for which lowering the legal BAC limit to zero would affect drink-driving behaviour: “Targeted BAC levels” scenario assumed that the new policy would impact only the specifically targeted BAC category, i.e., drivers in the category BAC below 0.5 g/L. “Extended impact” scenario corresponded to the “Targeted BAC levels” scenario to which we added a “halo effect” on drivers in the BAC category “0.5 g/L ≤ BAC < 0.8 g/L”. “Broad range impact” scenario corresponded to the “Extended impact” scenario to where we extended the “halo effect” to drivers in the BAC category “0.8 g/L ≤ BAC < 1.2 g/L”.
Methods
The effect estimates were based on firstly, scientific literature on risks related to drink-driving at different BAC-levels, secondly data on crashes in Belgium and thirdly data on drink-driving behaviour in Belgium and in other European countries.
Results
In case of a zero limit for all drivers, an annual reduction can be expected of 10 to 17 fatalities (i.e., a decrease of 2.4% to 3.9%), 8 to 20 severe injuries (i.e., a decrease of 0.3% to 0.8%) and 135 to 315 slight injuries (i.e., a decrease of 0.4% to 0.8%). In case a zero limit is only applied to novice drivers, an annual decrease can be expected by 2 to 4 fatalities (i.e., a decline of 3.7% to 6.2%), 8 to 16 serious injuries and 135 to 262 slight injuries (i.e., a decline of 1.7% to 3.2% in both cases).
Discussion
There is no clear evidence on which of the three scenarios would be the most plausible. As the relative risk of a car crash increases strongly with the BAC level, the success of either measure will strongly depend on its ability to also affect drink driving at concentrations that are forbidden already. This also means that most of the casualties could be prevented if compliance with current rules increased.}

The advances in in-vehicle video recording (IVVR) technologies have recently enabled traffic safety professionals to use more accurate crash information based on crash data reconstruction methods. Although a few studies have been conducted to identify the factors affecting the crash injury severity using such detailed crash data, there was no effort to analyze the factors affecting the injury severity in crashes between taxis and two-wheelers (TWs), including bicycles and motorcycles. Therefore, this study analyzes the injury severity of TW riders in taxi-TW crashes with the accurate crash data collected by taxis equipped with IVVR devices in Incheon, Korea. Two hundred and forty-eight crash data from two years (2010–2011) were used to perform this objective. The factors affecting the injury severity to TW riders were identified based on a partial proportional odds model for these data. Seven variables were found to affect the injury severity significantly: crash speed, second collision, third collision, Delta-V, crashes that occurred with a non-helmeted motorcycle rider, crashes where the collision type was sideswipe, and crashes under rainy or snowy weather conditions. On the other hand, two variables regarding crashes, where the taxi driver behavior helped reduce visible and severe injuries, were changing lanes and the young TW riders (<18 years).}

A parametric study considering the handrail type, standing angle, and friction coefficient between the shoes and ground was performed. Results show that the passenger dynamic response could be divided into two categories according to whether the passenger hit handrails. Passenger TBIs severity could be efficiently alleviated by the passenger body (excluding the head) hitting the handrail first before head-ground impact. The probabilities of DAI in the cerebellum and brain stem were low. A statistical analysis of TBIs demonstrated that the risks of TBIs were sensitive to the handrail type in subway collisions, but did not to the standing angle and friction coefficient.

This paper presents results from simulated single-bicycle crashes with the purpose to create an understanding of how different features of such devices affect the risk of injuries among cyclists. A Hybrid II 50th percentile crash test dummy was placed in the saddle of a bicycle and crash tests, usually at 25 km/h, were performed. Eleven different types of road equipment were included, and different crash angles were applied, in a total of over 50 crash tests. The road equipment represented temporary traffic control devices of various kind commonly used in Sweden, but also some specifically designed for cyclists. The tests were documented with several video cameras at different angles. Slow motion pictures were analyzed with focus on mechanisms during impact and the following motion of the bicycle and the dummy. Observations regarding “body parts” in contact with the road equipment were of particular interest highlighting design features of importance such as height, smoothness of surfaces and energy-absorbing capacity. The tests show that all bicycle crashes into road equipment can cause injuries and thus the use of work zone material on bicycle paths should be avoided, if possible. Safety barriers designated to prevent cyclists from falling into a shaft must be high enough to do so and be anchored and linked together correctly to prevent them from falling and creating dangerous situations. Temporary traffic control devices should be flexible or energy-absorbing to moderate the injury outcome of a potential bicycle crash. Fences should have a fine meshed net construction to prevent bicycle handlebars from getting stuck. All road equipment should be designed without sharp edges as they could cause injuries to cyclists passing or crashing into the equipment.}

abstract = {The risky lane-changing manoeuvre of vehicles often occurs at expressway entrances, which would result in a high crash risk in the freeway system and significantly impact its safety. The highly anticipated environment of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is expected to reduce the associated crash risk of lane changing by offering various types of driving support, which utilise surrounding traffic information. The modelling crash risk under the environment of CAV driving during mandatory lane changing in merging areas faces new challenges due to the novelty of CAVs and subsequent shortage of data. To explore such risk situation of multi-vehicle interaction at expressway entrances, this study proposed a supervised learning algorithm and a Bayesian hierarchical model to assess risk levels and predict the probability of risk occurrence at different risk levels of interactive vehicles in real time of mandatory driving behaviour during the merging process. The learning algorithm, based on XGBoost, was exploited to classify risk levels. The Bayesian hierarchical model was used to analyse the probability of real-time risk comprising vehicle physical state layer, multi-vehicle interaction layer and risk probability layer. The probabilistic model parameters were calibrated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Gibbs sampling method. The K-fold cross validation method was used to validate the proposed model of risk level. The probabilistic model validity was tested through posterior prediction of P-value. The quantitative risk estimation of CAVs through a few merging cases was conducted. Results show that the identification accuracy of slight, low, moderate and high risk is 94.24%, 85.82%, 84.16% and 79.69%, respectively. The P-value of Durbin–Watson’s posterior, normal hypothesis, test distribution symmetry and kurtosis are all close to 0.5. Therefore, the method of real-time risk assessment is convergent and has good fitting. This research can promote cautious driving behaviours and provide reference for driver’s decision making in the long term under the environment of CAVs.}

abstract = {With the promising development and deployment trends of autonomous vehicles (AVs), AVs’ operation safety has become a key issue worldwide. Studies have been conducted to reveal the risk factors of AV operation safety based upon AV-involved crash reports. However, the crash data sample size was limited and the crash reports only recorded static information, thus it failed to identify crash contributing factors and further provide feedbacks to AV algorithm development. In this study, the risk factors were investigated based upon hazardous scenarios, which were claimed to possess consistent causal mechanisms with crash events. First, contributing factors were extracted from both vehicle kinematics and traffic environment aspects, and their volatility features were obtained. Then, path analysis models were developed to reveal the concurrent relationships between scenario volatility and hazardous scenario occurrence probability. Besides, to understand the varying risk factors for hazardous scenarios caused by human drivers and AVs, a logit regression model was further established. The modeling results showed that large volatility of space headway held direct impacts on increasing the AV driving risks. And the volatility of the drivable road area had no significant impacts on AV driving risks while it indirectly influenced human driving risks. Finally, result implications for AV driving behavior improvements have been discussed.}

Morbidity or serious injury from road traffic collisions is estimated to increase to 265 million people between 2015 and 2030. Current road safety management systems rely heavily on manual data collection, visual inspection and subjective expert judgment for their effectiveness, which is costly, time-consuming, and sometimes ineffective due to under-reporting and the poor quality of the data. A range of innovations offers the potential to provide more comprehensive and effective data collection and analysis to improve road safety. However, there has been no systematic analysis of this evidence base. To this end, this paper provides a systematic review of the state of the art. It identifies that digital technologies - Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine-Learning, Image-Processing, Internet-of-Things (IoT), Smartphone applications, Geographic Information System (GIS), Global Positioning System (GPS), Drones, Social Media, Virtual-reality, Simulator, Radar, Sensor, Big Data – provide useful means for identifying and providing information on road safety factors including road user behaviour, road characteristics and operational environment. Moreover, the results show that digital technologies such as AI, Image processing and IoT have been widely applied to enhance road safety, due to their ability to automatically capture and analyse data while preventing the possibility of human error. However, a key gap in the literature remains their effectiveness in real-world environments. This limits their potential to be utilised by policymakers and practitioners.}

In this study, we aim to investigate the non-linear relationship between physical factors and pedestrian fatality at a location-specific level using a machine learning approach. The state-of-art machine learning algorithm, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), is employed for a binary classification problem, in which nationwide locations where fatal pedestrian accidents occurred for the years from 2012 to 2019 in Korea serve as positive samples (np = 13,366). For negative samples, locations with no pedestrian accidents are selected randomly to the size that is 10 times larger (nn = 133,660) than positive samples. Fifteen features under the categories of road conditions, road facilities, road networks, and land uses are assigned to both the positive and negative sample locations using Geographic Information System (GIS). A method is proposed to avoid the class imbalance problem, and a final unbiased model is utilized to predict fatal pedestrian risks at the negative sample locations. In addition, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) is introduced to provide a robust interpretation of the XGBoos prediction results. It is shown that 21.6% of the negative sample locations have a probability of fatal pedestrian accidents greater than 0.5 (or 78.4% accuracy). Generally, a road segment that lies in many of the shortest routes in a dense residential area with many lively activities from aligned buildings is a potential spot for fatal pedestrian accidents. However, based on the SHAP interpretation, the relationships between the features and pedestrian fatality are found nonlinear and locally heterogeneous. We discuss the implications of this result has for drafting policy recommendations to reduce pedestrian fatalities.}

Numerous studies have focused on rear-end accident research, but only a few constructive countermeasures are put forward. Driving risk evolution at the driver operational level before an accident is critical to collision avoidance. This paper puts forward a driver operational level identification of driving risk and graded alarm under near-crash conditions. Firstly, driving simulation is utilized to acquire the operation data of SV (subjective vehicle) under the condition of emergent deceleration of LV (leading vehicle). The kinematic model is built to characterize the law of the risk discrimination indices of SV including THW (time headway), SHW (space headway) and TTCi (the reciprocal of time to collision). The predicted results are consistent with the naturalistic driving data. Secondly, the three-dimensional distribution ‘speed-spacing-TTCi’ is applied to classify the risky driving state of SV. The precarious distribution is concentrated at the area where relative velocity increased to 23–40 km/h and spacing decreased to 18–30 m. Finally, based on the reaction time and braking distance reduction, the optimal external intervention is determined to be the acousto-optic way by driving simulation. For moderate drivers, a three-level alarm of 2.94 s, 1.94 s and 1.1 s is calibrated considering different driving styles and cumulative frequency curve of reaction time.}

abstract = {E-scooters are the fastest growing mode of micro-mobility with important environmental benefits. However, there are serious concerns about injuries caused by e-scooter accidents. Falls due to poor road surface conditions are a common cause of injury in e-scooter riders, and head injuries are one of the most common and concerning injuries in e-scooter falls. However, the head-ground impact biomechanics in e-scooter falls and its relationship with e-scooter speed and design, road surface conditions and wearing helmets remain poorly understood. To address some of these key questions, we predicted the head-ground impact force and velocity of e-scooter riders in different falls caused by potholes. We used multi-body dynamics approach to model a commercially available e-scooter and simulate 180 falls using human body models. We modelled different pothole sizes to test whether the pothole width and depth influences the onset of falls and head-ground impact velocity and force. We also tested whether the e-scooter travelling speed has an influence on the head-ground impact velocity and force. The simulations were carried out with three human body models to ensure that the results of the study are inclusive of a wide range of rider sizes. For our 10 in. diameter e-scooter wheels, we found a sudden increase in the occurrence of falls when the pothole depth was increased from 3 cm (no falls) to 6 cm (41 falls out of 60 cases). When the falls occurred, we found a head-ground impact force of 13.2 ± 3.4kN, which is larger than skull fracture thresholds. The head-ground impact speed was 6.3 ± 1.4 m/s, which is the same as the impact speed prescribed in bicycle helmet standards. All e-scooter falls resulted in oblique head impacts, with an impact angle of 65 ± 10° (measured from the ground). Decreasing the e-scooter speed reduced the head impact speed. For instance, reducing the e-scooter speed from 30 km/h to 20 km/h led to a 14% reduction in the mean impact speed and 12% reduction in the mean impact force, as predicted by the models. The models also showed that the median male riders were sustaining higher head-ground impact force and speed compared with the small female and large male riders. The findings of this study can assist authorities and e-scooter hiring companies to take more informed actions about road surface conditions and speed limits. These results can also help define representative impact test conditions for assessing the performance of helmets used by e-scooter riders in order to reduce head and brain injuries in e-scooter falls.}

For example, female patients with diabetes present more physical and cognitive limitations than male patients in terms of cognitive adjustment, quality of decision making, and functioning. Studies about traffic safety report that diabetic drivers are at increased risk of being involved in road crashes, especially when driving in a state of hypoglycemia under which their blood glucose level is too low. We have recently demonstrated that acute hyperglycemia (when the blood glucose level is too high) can also lead to poor driving performance among T1DM young adult patients. Against this background, the objective of the present study was to find out whether gender affects the driving performance of young drivers with diabetes. Twenty-six T1DM drivers participated in a counterbalanced crossover experiment. While being monitored by an eye tracker, they drove a driving simulator and twice navigated through the nine hazardous scenarios: once under a normal blood glucose (euglycemia) level and once high blood glucose (hyperglycemia) level. The first main result is that young female drivers are more affected by diabetes than young male drivers, regardless of momentary glycemic changes. The second main result is that poor glycemic control substantially deteriorates hazard perception and driving performance of young males with diabetes. Thus, it is argued that an uncontrolled state of a high blood glucose level may be more hazardous for young males with diabetes since it negatively impacts their driving performance.}

The factors influencing the sight triangle for human drivers are considered in the 2018 AASHTO Green Book, but the Green Book lacks quantitative estimations for automated vehicles (AVs). Therefore, to guarantee the AV’s operational safety, this study investigated the impact of intersection angle, speed, and crossing distance on the AV’s intersection crossing maneuver. Using physics theorems and cosine law, formulae for the detecting angle (DA) and distance (DD), the two main components of the departure sight triangle, were developed for the acute- and obtuse-angle sides of the intersection for an AV approaching on the minor road; the minimum required DA and DD, with a given crossing distance, are thus proposed for the AV’s operational design domain (ODD). Calculations indicate that the DD is mainly affected by the major road design speed and crossing distance, and that the DD increases very quickly as the speed and crossing distance increase. The intersection angle was found to have great impact on the DA on both the acute and obtuse sides, but its influence is negative on the acute side and positive on the obtuse side. On the acute side, the ODD detecting angle range is set as [83.4, 132.7], [80.7, 131.6], and [78.4, 130.7] degrees for major roads with 2, 4, and 6 lanes, respectively. On the obtuse side, the ODD is set as [57.4, 160.6], [70.6, 207.9], and [82.2, 249.1] m for the same respective roads. After comparing the DA and DD results, and depending on the intersection design attributes, it is concluded that most engineering attention should be paid to the DA on the acute side and DD on the obtuse side.}

abstract = {In roadway safety management, safety performance functions (SPFs) are widely used by state and local agencies to predict crashes for base site conditions. SPFs are developed based on historical traffic safety data and are used to make predictions for anticipated site characteristics in the future. An underlying assumption in SPF development is that the relationships between crash frequency and site conditions are stationary from the past (when the model data were collected) to the future (for which SPFs are applied). The assumption using the past to represent the future could be fundamentally problematic. This study proposes a modeling framework that can relax this assumption. Specifically, this framework integrates temporal modeling with time-series analysis to strengthen the current SPF estimation methods. The temporal modeling approach is Temporally Weighted Negative Binomial Regression (TWNBW), and the time-series analysis is tried by employing the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) methods. The temporal modeling is to uncover the temporal variations of SPFs and the time-series analysis explains and predicts the relationship between the SPF’s temporal variation and time. The outcome of the framework is a set of Future SPFs that capture the temporal unobserved heterogeneity in safety data and describe the predicted relationships between safety performance and site characteristics in the future. A case study using six-year safety datasets from Georgia was conducted to illustrate the key components of the modeling framework. The temporal modeling results showed significant variations in SPFs across time. The parameters for traffic volume, i.e., Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT), and segment length are associated with an increasing trend with time, and for access point density there is a descending trend. The SPF parameters are found to have a strong seasonality. Both time-series modeling methods appear to be appropriate to explain the temporal variations of SPF parameters, and the models are able to predict SPF parameters with acceptable errors smaller than 1% on average. Future SPFs can be used to support the roadway safety management that affects future traffic safety performance.}

abstract = {The state of practice of investigating traffic safety and operation is primarily based on traditional data sources, such as spot sensors, loop detectors, and historical crash data. Recently, researchers have utilized transportation data from instrumented vehicles, driving simulators, and microsimulation modeling. However, these data sources might not represent the actual driving environment at a trajectory level and might introduce bias due to their experimental control. The shortcomings of these data sources can be overcome via Naturalistic Driving Studies (NDSs) considering the fact that NDS provides detailed real-time driving data that would help investigate the safety and operational impacts of human behavior along with other factors related to weather, traffic, and roadway geometry in a naturalistic setting. With the enormous potential of the NDS data, this study leveraged the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyzes (PRISMA) approach to shortlist the most relevant naturalistic studies out of 2304 initial studies around the world with a focus on traffic safety and operation over the past fifteen years (2005–2020). A total of 117 studies were systematically reviewed, which were grouped into seven relevant topics, including driver behavior and performance, crash/near-crash causation, driver distraction, pedestrian/bicycle safety, intersection/traffic signal related studies, detection and prediction using NDSs data, based on their frequency of appearance in the keywords of these studies. The proper deployment of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) require an appropriate level of human behavior integration, especially at the intimal stages where both CAV and human-driven vehicles will interact and share the same roadways in a mixed traffic environment. In order to integrate the heterogeneous nature of human behavior through behavior cloning approach, real-time trajectory-level NDS data is essential. The insights from this study revealed that NDSs could be effectively leveraged to perfect the behavior cloning to facilitate rapid and safe implementation of CAV.}

We address this question by analysing data from a large-scale online survey, where participants rated images illustrating a wide range of cycling infrastructure designs for the anticipated level of subjective safety when imagining to cycle at the displayed location. Cycling tracks are perceived as safer than cycling lanes, which in turn are preferred over cycling on the street. Physical separations from the car lane, a greater lane width, and a coloured surface contribute most to a high subjective safety of cycling lanes. Additional buffers on the left- and right side of cycling lanes can have varying effects. On narrower cycling lanes, people experience extensive buffer designs as rather constraining and as impairing their safety. Combining several safety features (i.e. a sufficient demarcation of the left buffer and a coloured surface) is not necessarily beneficial for subjective safety. Our findings are mostly in line with findings on the factors benefitting or impairing objective safety. However, the relation of subjective and objective safety requires further attention.}

At the same time, there has been an increase in both cycling trips and traffic accidents involving cyclists. This paper aims to provide new insights and policy guidance regarding the effect of COVID-19 related travel-restriction policies on the road traffic accident patterns, with an emphasis on cyclists’ safety. Specifically, by analysing the accidents data in the New York City and estimating three fixed effects logit models on the occurrence of different types of accidents in a given zip code area and time interval, we derived the following findings. First, while the overall number of road traffic accidents plummeted in the NYC after the stay-at-home policy was implemented, the average severity increased. The average number of cyclists killed or injured per accidents more than tripled relative to levels in similar times in previous years. Second, the declaration of the New York State stay-at-home order was significantly associated with a higher risk of accidents resulting in casualties. The number of Citi Bike trips in the area at the time overwhelmingly predicted severe risk for cyclists. Last, we applied the models to detect hot zones for cyclists’ severe accidents. We found that these hot zones tend to be spatially and temporally concentrated, making it possible to devise targeted safety measures. This paper contributes to the understanding of the impact of COVID-19 travel-restriction policies on accidents involving cyclists, reveals higher risks for cyclists as an unintended consequence of travel-restriction policies, and provides an analytical tool for road safety impact evaluation should future travel restrictions be considered.}

Although the general population positively perceives the installation of stop-signs in residential areas, little research has investigated the impact of AWS on road safety and road user behaviour. This paper investigated the safety effectiveness of converting MAS to AWS intersections using an observational before and after approach and surrogate measures of safety. More specifically, the safety impacts of AWS conversion were investigated using multiple indicators, including vehicle speed measures, vehicle–pedestrian, vehicle-cyclist, vehicles-vehicle interactions as well as yielding rates before and after the treatment implementation. A multi-level regression approach was adopted to determine the effect of stop signs controlling for built environments, traffic exposure, and intersection geometry factors as well as site-specific unobserved heterogeneity. A unique sample of 31 intersections were used in this before-after study. From this sample, video data were collected before and after implementing AWS. In total, 245 h of video were automatically processed and corrected using a specialized computer vision software. More than 68,000 (37,668 before and 31,305 after AWS treatment) road user trajectories were obtained from 104 approaches. The results show that the conversion of MAS to AWS intersections significantly decreased vehicle speed and increased post-encroachment time. This work also shows that implementing AWS significantly increased the yielding rates from 45.7% to 76.7% in MAS conditions and reduced the average speed of motor-vehicles. Using multi-level regression model, it is estimated that when the intersection was converted from MAS to AWS, the minimum speed in the major approaches was reduced by 60.0%.}

abstract = {This driving simulator study investigated the effect of inconsistent steering guidance during system and user-initiated transitions from Highly Automated Driving (HAD). In particular, the aim of the study was to understand if steering conflicts could be achieved by adopting inconsistent steering guidance and whether these conflicts could be exploited to accelerate drivers’ steering engagement within a limited time. Inconsistent steering guidance was generated by switching the guidance on and off at 3 different frequencies (0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 Hz). Results revealed that steering engagement has more to do with the initiation rather than the quality of the steering guidance. In fact, drivers were more engaged with the steering task when they initiated the transition themselves. Compared to system-initiated transitions, in user-initiated ones, drivers exerted stronger steering inputs throughout the transition, which allowed them to maintain larger Time To Lane Crossing (TTLC) values with fewer steering corrections. During system-initiated transitions, drivers started to actively engage with the steering activity only after more than 5 s from the start of the transition but were able to achieve a steering behaviour close to the one shown during user-initiated transitions at 10 s.}

The approach generalizes a recently proposed approach by Gayah and Donnell (2021) (GD) titled “Estimating safety performance functions for two-lane rural roads using an alternative functional form for traffic volume”. GD approach proposes a multiple regime structure for AADT impact while explicitly constraining the impact at the regime threshold to be the same. While the GD approach provides a flexible structure, the framework as proposed calls for careful judgement for threshold selection and additional model estimation complexity for the AADT constraint. The current note establishes the equivalence of the proposed approach with the GD approach and subsequently presents a more flexible model structure that improves on the GD approach. Subsequently, we document the advantages of our proposed approach in terms of model estimation, parameter significance testing, flexibility to consider multiple traffic volume ranges and ease of accommodating random parameters for analysis. Finally, we present potential directions for future research.}

abstract = {Between 2009 and 2019, pedestrian fatalities in the U.S. increased 51.0% while all other traffic fatalities increased 0.4%. To mitigate pedestrian safety issues, practitioners increasingly use police-reported data to identify and treat locations that experience either serious or fatal injuries. We investigated how many and which types of pedestrian injuries were misclassified by police-reported data in New Mexico between 2014 and 2018 by matching pedestrian-vehicle crash victims reported in New Mexico Department of Transportation (NMDOT) crash data to patients treated at University of New Mexico Health-Science Center, an American College of Surgeons-certified level 1 trauma center (n = 3097 pedestrians in NMDOT data; n = 512 matched pedestrians). Findings suggest that injuries involving older pedestrians, males, alcohol, more serious injuries, and those that occur at night are more likely to match to the hospital data. Of the non-fatally injured pedestrians who police estimated as seriously-injured (n = 207), 21.7% were no more than minorly-injured (n = 45) (KABCO A and ISS < 9). Of pedestrians who police estimated as minorly-injured (n = 239), 55.6% were seriously-injured (n = 133) (KABCO B,C,O and ISS ≥ 9). Of pedestrians with true serious injuries (n = 295) (ISS ≥ 9), 45.1% were under-estimated by police (n = 133) (KABCO B,C,O and ISS ≥ 9) whereas 29.8% of pedestrians with true minor injuries (n = 151) (ISS < 9) were over-estimated by police (n = 45) (KABCO A and ISS < 9). Minorly-injured pedestrians who were over-estimated by police (KABCO A and ISS < 9) were more likely to have lower extremity injuries (62.2% vs 42.5%, p-value = 0.013) compared to minorly-injured pedestrians whose injury severities were estimated correctly (KABCO B,C,O and ISS < 9). Seriously-injured pedestrians who were under-estimated (KABCO B,C,O and ISS ≥ 9) were less likely to have injuries to the head (39.8% vs. 55.6%, p-value = 0.003), spine (30.1% vs. 50.0%, p-value < 0.001), thorax (53.4% vs. 66.7%, p-value = 0.0139), or abdomen (18.8% vs. 32.1%, p-value = 0.005) compared to seriously-injured pedestrians whose injury severities were estimated correctly (KABCO A and ISS ≥ 9). This research illustrates the importance of linking police and health outcome databases to provide a more complete understanding of traffic safety.}

Supervisory monitoring, taking over vehicle control during automation failures and then bringing the vehicle to safety under time pressure are cognitively demanding tasks that pose varying difficulties across the driving population. This underpins a need to investigate individual differences (i.e., how people differ in their dispositional traits) in driver responses to automation system limits, so that autonomous vehicle design can be tailored to meet the safety-critical needs of higher-risk drivers. However, few studies thus far have examined individual differences, with self-report measures showing limited ability to predict driver takeover performance. To address this gap, the present study explored the utility of an established brain activity-based objective index of trait attentional control (frontal theta/beta ratio; TBR) in predicting driver interactions with conditional automation. Frontal TBR predicted drivers’ average takeover reaction time, as well as the likelihood of accident after takeover. Moving towards practical applications, this study also demonstrated the utility of streamlined estimates of frontal TBR measured from the forehead electrodes and from a single crown electrode, with the latter showing better fidelity and predictive value. Overall, TBR is behaviourally relevant, measurable with minimal sensors and easily computable, rendering it a promising candidate for practical and objective assessment of drivers’ neurocognitive traits that contribute to their AV driving readiness.}

Building on recent research that suggests increasing the pertinence of informal sanctions (sense of guilt, fear of peer disapproval, or fear of hurting oneself and others) decreases the likelihood of illegal smartphone engagement while driving, this study aimed to determine if perceptions of risk information, that is, how effective drivers believe the information is in deterring their illegal use, is associated with perceptions of informal sanctions. An online survey of 1027 Victorians who self-reported illegal smartphone use while driving asked participants to rate the personal deterrent effectiveness of five types of risks associated with illegal smartphone use while driving. A hierarchical linear regression model explored the associations between the most effective risks and each informal sanction. Female drivers were more likely than male drivers to experience guilt, fear of social loss and fear of physical loss when using their smartphones illegally. More frequent illegal smartphone engagement while driving was associated with decreased impact of informal sanctions. Female drivers were more likely than male drivers to perceive each risk as effective. The most effective piece of information was, “Contributes to 16% of Victorian road deaths and serious injuries annually”; it was also the least known (32.7% males, 26.7% females). This message, alongside, “Increases risk of a crash comparable to those associated with driving under the influence of alcohol or cannabis” and, “A 2 s glance at your phone while driving at 50 km/h effectively means driving blind for 27 m”, were associated with stronger perceptions of guilt, fear of peer disapproval, or fear of hurting oneself and others when thinking about using a smartphone illegally while driving. These results suggest tailoring and targeting these specific risk information may be effective in deterring illegal smartphone use while driving.}

For each date in 2020, crash data from the previous week, month, season, half year, one year, two years, three years, and four years are collected respectively as eight temporal levels. MCA plots and chi-square distance analysis are used to assess the temporal stability of associations between crash characteristics across dates in 2020 with data from various temporal levels. The key findings of this study demonstrate that associations between crash characteristics at lower temporal levels show notable and potential cyclical variations across dates, while more stable and long-term trend of associations between crash characteristics may be identified as the temporal level increases, especially at the two-year level and higher temporal levels at which temporal stability may be expected. The study contributes to the literature by presenting a challenge for traffic analysts in that both temporally stable and unstable associations between crash characteristics may be observed at any point in time when different temporal levels are considered as study periods. Therefore, it may serve as a foundation for future research and practical works to identify traffic safety issues and optimal policies as well as facilitate the interpretation of statistical modeling in the presence of temporally unstable data.}

Manage-how-you-drive (MHYD) insurance, a new type of UBI, incorporates active safety management to monitor driver behavior and issue warnings as needed. While researchers have introduced telematics data into automobile insurance pricing, the specific effect of in-vehicle active safety management on driver risk assessment has been neglected, especially for truck drivers, whose crashes have more serious consequences. This study uses telematics and in-vehicle monitoring features to examine the key factors underlying large commercial truck crashes, and quantifies the effect of these factors on crash risk. Data from 2,185 trucks in Shanghai, China, were collected for a total of 105,786 trips and 465,555 in-vehicle warnings to investigate three types of factors affecting risk: travel characteristics, driving behavior, and in-vehicle warnings. A zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression model was built, and a ZIP model without the warning variables as well as a basic Poisson model with warnings were considered for comparison. It was found that the ZIP model considering in-vehicle warning information performed significantly better than the other models. The standardized regression coefficient method was used to identify the most important variables. In-vehicle yawn and smoking warnings had significantly more association with the number of crashes than did the travel characteristics and driving behavior variables, though freeway distance traveled, average freeway speed, percentage of trips on sunny days, and percentage of trips at night also correlated significantly with crash risk. These results can provide a reference for UBI insurance professionals considering in-vehicle active safety management, as well as support freight companies in drafting appropriate working regulations.}

However, this process has not been systematically investigated in bus drivers. The present study uses structural equation model to assess whether enterprise management and external environment are associated with risky self-reported driving behaviors both directly and indirectly, through the effects of attitudes towards traffic safety in a large sample of bus drivers. Three hundred and thirty-one bus drivers (mean age = 39.5, SD = 5.6 years) completed a structured and anonymous questionnaire measuring enterprise management, external environment, attitudes toward traffic safety, and self-reported risky driving behaviors (i.e., speeding, fatigue driving, running the light) in the last 6 months. Structural equation modeling analysis revealed that enterprise management, and external environment were associated with risky driving behaviors both directly and indirectly. In particular both of them were directly correlated with bus drivers’ attitudes toward traffic safety which, in turn, were related to the five types of self-reported risky driving behaviors. The present findings suggest that measures related to the impact factors could be carried out to reduce the probabilities of the risky driving behaviors among bus drivers, such as improving the salary level of bus drivers, setting up bus lanes and priority signals to alleviate road congestion, optimizing shift schedules, implementing effective safety education, etc. These findings can provide the empirical basis for evidence-based road safety interventions in the context of public transport.}

abstract = {The main objective of this study is to evaluate highway crash risk and improve the spatial and temporal transferability of crash risk models. The predictive performance is affected by the difficulty of existing models to quantify crash risk from historical traffic flow data at different locations and times and may not fully capture the complex nonlinear relationships between high-dimensional factors in traffic flow states. Oregon US26W freeway data from 2016 and 2017 and I5N freeway data from 2017 were used. Raw detector data collected from two consecutive detector stations upstream-downstream detector stations were converted into 30 traffic variables. The averages, standard deviations, and coefficients of variation were obtained by aggregating traffic values using each lane. Candidate variables for traffic flow were extracted, and the importance of each variable was calculated using LightGBM, which reveals that variable differences between lanes contributed more. The manifold distance was then applied to quantify the crash risk and classify traffic crashes or not. When the manifold distance is 0.4, it could effectively distinguish traffic crashes. TransferBoost was further employed to build a crash risk model. Modeling using 2016 and 2017 data from the US26W freeway revealed a significant decrease in AUC and a gradual decrease in the model’s sensitivity. However, the crash risk prediction performance of TransferBoost improved by 5.2% when modeling using 2017 data from US26W and I5N freeways. The results show that the model developed for one time period cannot be directly used to predict crash risk for another period on the same freeway. However, the model developed for one highway cannot be directly used to predict the crash risk of another highway either, maintaining some transferability at low false alarm rates. TransferBoost provides a fresh perspective on the transferability of the model. The findings of this study could facilitate more accurate proactive safety management and improvement countermeasure development.}

This systematic review seeks to identify factors associated with drug driving (i.e., driving after consuming drugs other than alcohol) to highlight gaps in existing knowledge and inform the design of more effective countermeasures. A search of the literature was conducted for the period January 1, 2005 to July 31, 2021 using six different databases. The search protocol followed PRISMA guidelines and was registered in PROSPERO (#CRD42021234616). Studies that met inclusion criteria compared drug drivers with either non-drug drivers, alcohol-only drivers or drug drivers from an earlier time period, to identify factors specifically associated with drug driving, rather than common to all drivers. Two hundred and nineteen publications met the inclusion criteria and were included within the review. Based on the findings, a logic model was developed that presents the factors associated with drug driving. Various sociodemographic, psychosocial and legal factors emerged as the main factors associated with illegal drug driving. At the sociodemographic and psychological levels, drug drivers were more likely to be single, young males who often drive after using cannabis and who score high on sensation-seeking and impulsivity scales. The key social factor found to be associated with drug driving was peer acceptance/disapproval of the behaviour. At the legal level, the review suggested that the effectiveness of current enforcement approaches to drug driving vary among jurisdictions around the world due to differences in the level of perceived certainty of apprehension and the chances of punishment avoidance. Future research into the anticipated and actual rewards for drug driving is needed to inform the development of more effective countermeasures.}

Unlike time-critical takeover situations in which drivers must respond within a relatively short time frame, the ToRs for non-critical events such as exiting from a freeway can be scheduled way ahead of time. It is unknown how the ToR lead time affects driver SA for resuming manual control and when to send the ToR is most appropriate in non-critical takeover events. The present study conducted a web-based, supervised experiment with 31 participants using conditional automation systems in freeway existing scenarios while playing a mobile game. Each participant experienced 12 trials with different ToR lead times (6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 25, 30, 45, and 60 s) for exiting from freeways in a randomized order. Driver SA was measured by using a freeze probe technique in each trial when the participant pressed the spacebar on the laptop to simulate the takeover action. Results revealed a positive effect of longer ToR lead times on driver SA for resuming control to exit from freeways and the effect leveled off at the lead time of 16–30 s. The participants tended to postpone their takeover actions further when they were given a longer ToR lead time and it did not level off up to 60 s. Nevertheless, not all drivers waited till the last moment to take over AVs even though they did not get sufficient SA. The ToR lead time of 16–30 s was recommended for better SA; and it could be narrowed down to 25–30 s if considering the subjective evaluations on takeover readiness, workload, and trust. The findings provide implications for the future design of conditional automation systems used for freeway driving.}

This study takes two self-report behavioural measures, the Walking Behaviour Questionnaire (WBQ) and the Cycling Behaviour Questionnaire (WBQ), and pilots them in the UK. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses with data from 428 respondents revealed factor structures different to those described in the limited number of previous studies that used the CBQ and WBQ. Across both questionnaires, scales measuring intentional behaviour differed from original descriptions to a greater extent than did the scale concerning unintentional attention or memory errors. In addition to a validation exercise, this research explored the relationships between variables, finding a correlation between the reported performance of unintentional errors when walking and cycling. Looking in more detail at cycling behaviours, we found that those who rated themselves as more proficient cyclists also reported performing fewer unintentional cycling errors. Results also showed self-reported helmet use to bear little to no relationship with other self-reported cycling behaviours or self-rated cycling proficiency. Finally, using structural equation modelling, we demonstrated that responses to the CBQ add very little (over and above age, gender, and exposure to the road environment) to the explanation of self-reported past collision involvement. In total, only 7% of the variation in past collision involvement was explained by the included variables. We urge caution when using self-report behavioural measures that have not been validated in the context of intended use, and the importance of using such measures in combination with other approaches rather than in isolation when trying to develop an understanding of overall system performance.}

This slowly changing thermal hazard not only has a prominent impact on the stability of tunnel surrounding structures, but also deteriorates the tunnel thermal environment, so the formation of the thermal hazard should be investigated. In this work, the thermal hazard model of tunnel surrounding rock was established under the superposition of ground atmospheric temperature wave and tunnel wind flow temperature wave. The corresponding simulation software was developed to estimate the thermal hazards. This dual periodic temperature boundary model (DPTB) was also investigated in comparison with the single periodic temperature boundary (SPTB) model that simplified the periodic ground atmospheric temperature to a constant. The results show that the overlying rock layer of the tunnel is more affected by the superposition of double periodic temperature waves, and its temperature will be significantly higher in autumn. For the calculation example, the average annual heat storage in the surrounding rock under the DPTB is 41,775 kJ/m2, reduced by 432 kJ/m2 compared to the SPTB. The average temperature rise in the shallow surface surrounding rock over 25 years under the DPTB is about 2.04 °C, which is 0.48 °C lower than that of the SPTB. These calculation results provide a reference for the thermal hazards control in underground railway tunnels.}

abstract = {Predicting pedestrian crashes on urban roads is one of the most important issues related to urban traffic safety. Due to the lack of spatial correlation and instability in the crash data, the statistical reliability of Empirical Bayesian method in the combination of the observed and predicted crash frequency is questionable. In this study, an EB model has been developed to estimate the expected frequency of pedestrian crashes in urban areas using the over-dispersion parameter taking into account the spatial correlation of crash data. The objective of this study is to estimate the expected geographical frequency of pedestrian crashes using the Empirical Bayesian (EB) approach using weighted geographical regression models for pedestrian crashes in Tehran. For doing so, four models of geographic weighted Poisson regression (GWPR), geographic weighted zero-inflated Poisson regression (GWZIPR), geographic weighted Negative Binomial regression (GWNBR) and the geographic weighted zero-inflated Negative Binomial regression (GWZINBR) have been used. In this study, the areas analyzed for the development of the EB model based on pedestrian exposure variables include traffic analysis zones (TAZs). Finally, the EB model was extended to the Geographic Empirical Bayesian (Ge-EB) model. The results showed that GWZIPR and GWZINBR models make more accurate predictions. These models had the lowest values of Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the lowest values of Cross Validation and the lowest values of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The Moran and Variance Inflated Factor (VIF) indices were also within acceptable limits. The weighted negative binomial distribution could moderate the amount of heterogeneity of crash data to some extent. This study has shown the dispersion and density of pedestrian crashes without having the volume of pedestrians and thus can be done by taking safety measures in places prone to pedestrian crashes.}

abstract = {Transportation safety related to e-bikes is becoming more problematic with the growing popularity in recent decade years, however, rare studies focused on the protection for e-bike riders in traffic accidents. This paper aimed to investigate the relationship between vehicle front-end structures and rider’s injury based on a novel approach including modeling, sampling, and analyzing. Firstly, a parametrized model for front-end structures of the vehicle was developed with nine parameters to realize the standardization of multi-body models of car to e-bike collision considering three stature riders and different impacting velocities. Secondly, a framework, combining Monte Carlo sampling for twelve initial variables and automatic operation for 1000 impact simulations, was built to obtain valid results automatically and then to construct a big dataset. Finally, according to the sensitive variables to riders’ vulnerable regions, the decision tree algorithm was further adopted to develop the decision or prediction model on injuries. The novel approach achieved the stochastical generation of vehicle shapes and the automatic operation of multi-body models. The results showed that the rider’s head, pelvis, and thighs were more vulnerable to being injured in the car to e-bike perpendicular accidents. The three decision tree models (HIC15, lateral force of pelvis, bending moment of upper leg) were validated to be accurate and reliable according to the confusion matrix with the precision of more than 80% and the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) with the under area more than 85%. Based on decision tree models, not only the effects of front-end structural parameters on the corresponding injury but also the interaction mechanism between various variables can be clearly interpreted. Each route from the same root node to hierarchical middle nodes then to various leaf nodes represented a decision-making process. And the different branches under the same decision node directly illustrated the correlation between variables, which is highly readable and comprehensible. During the safety performance design of front-end structures, the rational value of variables could be decided according to decision routes that resulted in lower injury levels; Even if the accident was inevitable, the collision parameters could be controlled within a certain range for the least injury according to the prediction rules. Based on the novel framework coupling Monte Carlo sampling and automatic operation, it’s foreseeable to apply the parametric and standard car-to-e-bike collision models to develop the virtual test system and to optimize front-end shapes for rider’s protection.}

Bicyclists are more vulnerable than motorists on road and their pre-crash behaviors play an essential role in the pathways leading to injuries. The objective of this study is to develop a methodological framework that integrates machine learning with path analysis to quantify behavioral pathways in bicycle-motor vehicle crashes. Specifically, two sets of models are developed for predicting: 1) pre-crash behaviors given contributing factors and 2) bicyclist injury severity given contributing factors including pre-crash behaviors. The path analysis chains machine learning models to establish the indirect linkages between contributing factors and injury severities through correlates of pre-crash behaviors. This study explored five machine learning methods, including Random Forest (RF), Categorical Naive Bayes (CNB), Support vector machine (SVM), AdaBoost (Boost), and Neural network (NN). To reduce the bias of any single model, this study proposes a technique to combine model estimates by averaging marginal effects. This study used a dataset containing 9,296 bicycle-motor vehicle crashes to demonstrate the application of the framework. Across five machine learning models, the signs of marginal effects generally agree but their magnitudes vary substantially. The pre-crash behavior of “bicyclist failed to yield” increases bicyclist injury severity by 1.11%. The path analysis results highlighted contributing factors related to risky pre-crash behaviors that lead to severe injuries, such as bicyclist intoxication. The framework is expected to support agencies’ decision-making to improve cycling safety by reducing unsafe behaviors on roads.}

The focus was on analyzing pre-crash factors such as speed and light conditions, as well as other factors such as impact configurations and cyclist injuries. Three main crash scenarios were identified among the crashes that were studied. The most common one (comprising 65%) was CS1: “continued same-direction” with no intention of turning by either road user. The other two scenarios were CS2: “the bicycle crosses the vehicle’s path by turning” (16%) and CS3: “the car crosses the bicycle’s path by turning” (19%). The CS1 crashes were divided into three overtaking phases: approaching and steering, passing, and returning, representing 42–44%, 41–44%, and 12–17%, respectively, of the CS1 scenario. The three crash scenarios varied in car and bicycle speeds, road type, and weather and light conditions, as well as in impact points and cyclist injuries. The analysis of different same-direction crash scenarios and overtaking phases in this study offers a novel view of same-direction crashes, providing relevant information for the design of methods for the evaluation of crash avoidance and injury mitigation measures for these scenarios.}

Riding behavior of bicyclists could shift over time, affecting the level of injuries sustained in bicyclist-involved crashes. Many studies have been done to identify the factors influencing bicyclist injury severity, but the temporal stability of these variables over time needs further study. The temporal instability of components that affect the cyclist injury levels in bicycle collisions is explored in this paper. To obtain potential unobserved heterogeneity, yearly models of cyclist-injury levels (including potential consequences of no, minor, and severe injury) were measured separately applying a random parameters logit model that allows for potential heterogeneity in estimated parameters’ means and variances. Employing a data source on bicycle collisions in Los Angeles, California, over the course of six years (January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2017), several variables which may impact the injury level of cyclists were explored. This paper has also employed a set of likelihood ratio tests assessing the temporal instability of the models. The temporal instability of the explanatory parameters has been evaluated with marginal effects. The results of the model assessment indicate that several factors may raise the chances of severe bicyclist injuries in collisions, including cyclists older than 55 years old, cyclists who were identified to be at-fault in crashes, rear-end collisions, cyclists who crossed into opposing lane before the collision, crashes occurring early mornings (i.e., 00:00 to 06:00) and so on. The results also showed that the details and estimated parameters of the model do not remain stable over the years, however the source of this instability is unclear. In addition, the findings of model estimation demonstrate that considering the heterogeneity in the random parameter means and variances will enhance the overall model fit. This study also emphasizes the significance of accounting for the transferability of estimated models and the temporal instability of parameters influencing the injury severity outcomes in order to dynamically examine the collected data and adjust safety regulations according to new observations.}

abstract = {Current designs of advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS) mainly developed uniform collision warning algorithms, which ignore the heterogeneity of driving behaviors, thus lead to low drivers’ trust in. To address this issue, developing personalized driving assistance algorithms is a promising approach. However, current personalization systems were mainly implemented through manually adjusting warning trigger thresholds, which would be less feasible for overall drivers as certain domain expertise is required to set personal thresholds accurately. Other personalization techniques exploited individual drivers’ data to build personalized models. Such approach could learn personal behavior but requires impractical large-scale individual data collections. To fill up the gaps, self-adaptive algorithms for personalized forward collision warning (FCW) based on federated learning were proposed in this study. A baseline model was developed by long short-term memory (LSTM) for FCW. Federated learning framework was then introduced to collect knowledge from multiple drivers with privacy preserving. Specifically, a general cloud server model was trained by collecting updated parameters from individual vehicle server models rather than collecting raw data. Besides, a driver-specific batch normalization (BN) layer was added into each vehicle server model to address the heterogeneity of driving behaviors. Experiments show empirically that the proposed federated-based personalized models with the BN layer showed to have the best performance. The average modeling accuracy has reached 84.88% and the performance is comparable to conventional total data collection training approach, where the additional BN layer could increase the accuracy by 3.48%. Finally, applications of the proposed framework and its further investigations have been discussed.}

Data for 201 spatially distributed road segments in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, USA were considered for the evaluation. Data related to teen crashes were obtained from the Highway Safety Information System (HSIS). Demographic and land use characteristics were extracted around each selected road segment using two different buffer widths (0.25 miles and 0.5 miles). Teen crash frequency of each road segment was used as the dependent variable. The generalized linear models with the negative binomial distribution (GLM-based NB model) and geographically weighted negative binomial regression models (GWNBR and GWNBRg) were developed and compared. The annual average daily traffic (AADT), light commercial land use, number of household units, and number of pupils enrolled in public or private high schools are significant explanatory variables influencing teen crash frequency. Both methods have good predictive capabilities and can be used to compute teen crash frequency. However, the GWNBR and GWNBRg better capture the spatial dependency and spatial heterogeneity of associated risk factors influencing teen crash frequency.}

abstract = {Background/Objectives
To examine the validity of high-contrast visual acuity and the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) as tools for identifying at-risk older drivers.
Design
Prospective multi-site observational cohort study.
Setting
Community sample drawn from cities of Brisbane and Canberra, Australia.
Participants
560 licensed drivers aged 65–96 years recruited between 2013 and 2016, from the community, an optometry clinic and driver referral service.
Measurements
50-minute standardized on-road driving test conducted on a standard urban route in a dual-brake vehicle with a driver trained Occupational Therapist assessor masked to participants’ cognitive, visual and medical status.
Results
Of 560 participants who completed the on-road test, 68 (12%) were classified as unsafe. Binary logistic regression models adjusted for age, gender, site, comorbidity and driving exposure indicated that a 1-point decrease in MMSE score was associated with a 1.35 (95%CI: 1.12–1.63) increase in odds of unsafe driving, and for each line reduction in binocular visual acuity (increase of 0.1 logMAR) was associated with 1.39 (95%CI: 1.07–1.81) increased odds of unsafe driving. However, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis showed low discriminative power for both measures (MMSE: AUC = 0.65 (95%CI: 0.58–0.73), visual acuity: AUC = 0.65 (95%CI: 0.59–0.72)) and typical cut-offs were associated with very low sensitivity for identifying unsafe drivers (MMSE <24/30: 2%; visual acuity worse than 6/12 Snellen (logMAR >0.30): 3%).
Conclusion
The MMSE and high-contrast visual acuity tests do not reliably identify at-risk older drivers. They have extremely low sensitivity for detecting unsafe drivers, even when used together, and poor prognostic properties relative to validated screening instruments that measure cognitive, vision and sensorimotor functions relevant to driving. Clinicians should select alternate validated driver screening tools where possible.}

Trespassing is the leading cause of rail-related fatalities and there has been little progress in reducing the trespassing frequency and deaths for the past ten years in the United States. Although the widespread deployment of surveillance cameras and vast amounts of video data in the railroad industry make witnessing these events achievable, it requires enormous labor-hours to monitor real-time videos or archival video data. To address this challenge and leverage this big data, this study develops a robust Artificial Intelligence (AI)-aided framework for the automatic detection of trespassing events. This deep learning-based tool automatically detects trespassing events, differentiates types of violators, generates video clips, and documents basic information of the trespassing events into one dataset. This study aims to provide the railroad industry with state-of-the-art AI tools to harness the untapped potential of video surveillance infrastructure through the risk analysis of their data feeds in specific locations. In the case study, the AI has analyzed over 1,600 h of archival video footage and detected around 3,000 trespassing events from one grade crossing in New Jersey. The data generated from these big video data will potentially help understand human factors in railroad safety research and contribute to specific trespassing proactive safety risk management initiatives and improve the safety of the train crew, rail passengers, and road users through engineering, education, and enforcement solutions to trespassing.}

In line with the risk homeostasis theory, during high-speed driving, drivers perceive smartphone usage as an unwarranted risk and in most cases refrain from doing so. During low-speed driving, however, drivers often use their smartphones, as they do not perceive this as inherently unsafe, even though it is. The goal of this study was to examine an intervention, based on the risk homeostasis theory, aimed at decreasing the use of smartphones while driving at low speeds. Thirty-seven young drivers participated in the research group that aimed to alter drivers’ risk perceptions, decision making, and behavior. The study also included a control group of 33 young drivers. All of the participants’ smartphone usage was monitored using a dedicated application that measured both the number of times drivers touched their smartphone screens while driving and the driving speed each time the screen was touched. The results indicate that drivers in the research group decreased their smartphone usage while driving, unlike the control group drivers who did not alter their behavior. In conclusion, a risk homeostasis-based intervention can decrease dangerous and unsafe driving behavior, even when such behavior is not perceived as significantly dangerous. Furthermore, additional types of risky and unsafe driving behaviors may be decreased using this type of intervention.}

Model-based and post-hoc ML interpretation methods are critically evaluated and compared to study their suitability in crash frequency modeling. These methods include classification and regression tree (CART), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), Local Sensitivity Analysis (LSA), Partial Dependence Plots (PDP), Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA), and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Model-based interpretation methods cannot reveal the detailed interaction relationships among risk factors. LIME can only be used to analyze the effects of a risk factor at the prediction level. LSA and PDP assume that different risk factors are independently distributed. Both GSA and SHAP can account for the potential correlation among risk factors. However, only SHAP can visualize the detailed relationships between crash outcomes and risk factors. This study also demonstrates the potential and benefits of using ML and SHAP to derive Crash Modification Factors (CMF). Finally, it is emphasized that statistical and ML models may not directly differentiate causation from correlation.

While technical aspects of collision risk and the effects of roads on animal populations are well studied, knowledge about wildlife behaviour prior to and during contact with oncoming vehicles as a crucial aspect of collision risk is still lacking. We analysed 28,400 hours of video data (thermal network cameras at 14 road sections in south-west Germany) with 2,841 animal-vehicle encounters (1,960 roe deer, Capreolus capreolus, 696 red fox, Vulpes vulpes and 185 wild boar, Sus scrofa) and classified animal behaviour before and during contact with a vehicle. We fitted two sets of models to the data. In the first step, we modelled the intensity of the behavioural reaction exhibited by the animals as a function of behavioural and environmental predictors using ordinal Bayesian mixed-effect regression models. In a second step, we modelled the probability of a positive vs. a negative behavioural response in terms of WVC risk using binomial mixed-effect regression models. Both the intensity of behavioural reactions as well as the degree of risk during the interaction with oncoming vehicles differed among the species and as a function of road section layout. Our results showed that animal attentiveness, the behaviour a priori, access to cover, vehicle type and biological seasonality were important predictors of an animal’s response to oncoming vehicles. More specifically, roe deer reacted to oncoming vehicles mostly with short movements away from the road, foxes often reacted unpredictably and wild boar behaviour appeared to be least affected by oncoming vehicles. Thus, we suggest that collision risk for common European mammals is shaped by the interplay of vehicle type, the road layout as well as the species-specific behavioural repertoire including the attentiveness of the animal and the behavioural state prior to an approaching vehicle. In addition, wildlife warning reflectors, a frequently used technique in WVC mitigation, did not alter behavioural reactions and thus failed to reduce WVC risk.}

abstract = {Introduction
Despite demonstrated effectiveness of child restraint system (CRS), its use in China is extremely low due to the lack of national legislation requiring the use of CRS, as well as lack of child passenger safety knowledge among caregivers. Implementing an effective intervention is urgently needed to promote the use of CRS. In this study, we primarily evaluated the effectiveness of biomechanical visualization delivered in the context of CRS education to promote CRS use.
Methods
We conducted a cluster randomised controlled trial to test the effects of educational intervention programs on increased use of CRS. Participants included caregivers from 8 pre-schools located in two cities (i.e., Chaozhou and Shantou) in China. Following a baseline survey, 8 pre-schools were randomly assigned into 1 of 4 groups with 2 schools in each group: 1) CRS education-only, 2) CRS education with behavioral skill training, 3) CRS education with biomechanical visualization, and 4) control. The primary outcome was CRS use, and the secondary outcomes included scores of child passenger safety-related knowledge and CRS use-related attitudes. The effect of the intervention was assessed among caregivers at two time points: baseline preintervention and 6 months postintervention.
Results
More than 70% caregivers had never used CRS at baseline. No statistically significant between-group differences CRS use were observed at baseline preintervention (34.2%, 25.4%, 29.6% and 21.9%, respectively, P = 0.18). However, compared to the control group, odds of CRS non-use was significantly lower in caregivers assigned to the CRS education with biomechanical visualization (adjusted odd ratio (AOR) = 0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.07–0.17), CRS education with behavioral skill training (AOR = 0.15, 95%CI = 0.10–0.24) and CRS education-only (AOR = 0.26, 95%CI = 0.17–0.41) groups, respectively. Statistically significant differences were also observed in the secondary outcomes postintervention across groups. Specifically, the CRS education with biomechanical visualization and CRS education with behavioral skill training groups had higher mean knowledge change scores than the CRS education-only group (3.3 ± 1.5 vs. 2.9 ± 2.2, p = 0.035 and 3.2 ± 1.9 vs. 2.9 ± 2.2, p = 0.039, respectively). We also observed a significantly higher increase in the attitudes scores in the CRS education with biomechanical visualization group compared with the CRS education-only group (4.7 ± 2.1 vs. 3.5 ± 2.8, p = 0.026).
Conclusions
This study shows that both biomechanical visualization and behavioral skill training supplements to education improved understanding of CRS knowledge compared to education only, and all three strategies led to increased CRS use. Importantly, CRS education with biomechanical visualization was shown to be more effective than CRS education alone in improving caregiver’s knowledge and attitudes. The use of biomechanical visualization may be an effective supplement to traditional education programs.}

Sexual activity while driving is a form of distracted driving because it includes an individual (the driver) who deviates resources from the primary task (driving) towards a secondary task (sexual activity).

Additionally, there is limited information on the context of where sexual activities while driving occurs and the influence of factors such as the environment, the vehicle, interactions with other road users, and other in-vehicle distractions. To cover this gap, a content analysis of sexually explicit media (SEM) was conducted on a sample of 270 videos depicting real driving. We conducted descriptive analyses and used decision tree analysis to explore the association between sexual activities while driving and their interactions with non-sexual driving behaviours and vehicle control. The videos portrayed a naturalistic driving situation of a driver of a moving vehicle engaging in sexual activity. The results show that when engaging in sexual activity, drivers do not present safe vehicle control. Sexual activity imposes additional cognitive, physical, and visual demands on the driver, thereby decreasing safety. Similar to other distractions, drivers engaging in sexual activity while driving appear to mitigate risks. Concerning the potential for legal sanctions, it appears that drivers may attempt to conceal sexual activity by reducing their visible nudity and minimising interactions with other road users. Finally, mobile phones and cameras appear to interact with sexual activities while driving, by imposing potential restrictions on the range of sexual activities. Implications for policymakers and practitioners are discussed.}

abstract = {Bus safety represents an important topic for injury prevention. When drivers experience conflict with their passengers, it likely distracts them from the driving task, both physically and mentally, and jeopardizes the safety of all passengers. However, detailed information concerning the frequency and type of conflicts between bus drivers and passengers is unavailable. We conducted a driver-reported cross-sectional survey to investigate the characteristics of driver-passenger conflict in the past month. The survey was completed in Changsha city, China in August 2019. In total, 779 bus drivers were surveyed. Of 732 drivers who completed the questionnaire, 635 (86.7%; 95% confidence interval: 84.3–89.1%) drivers reported experiencing at least one conflict with passengers in the past month. After adjusting for other demographic variables, drivers who were male, younger, less educated, less experienced as a bus driver, and with a comparatively high self-reported work intensity were more likely to report experiencing conflicts. Of the reported conflicts, verbal quarrels and abuses were most common, followed by “passengers attacked driver with physical objects like sticks or knives” and “passengers spat on or threw objects toward the driver”. Most drivers reported that they had experienced only conflicts causing no physical injury or financial loss in the past month, but a small portion experienced conflicts causing injuries to themselves. The most frequent reasons for driver-passenger conflicts were “passenger refused to pay fare”, “passenger requested to get off the bus at a location that was not a bus stop”, and “passenger was drunk or deliriously attacked the driver”. Bus drivers responded to some of the passengers’ verbal or physical attacks, but not all. Some preventive measures were adopted frequently by bus companies (e.g., bus alarms, protective shields for drivers) but others were not. Least often adopted were efforts to offer safety training for drivers (46.6%) and to offer psychological counseling services for drivers (39.1%). We conclude that bus driver-passenger conflicts are common in Changsha city, China. The conflicts impose a substantial threat to the safety of both drivers and passengers. We recommend multiple preventive actions to reduce driver-passenger conflicts and improve bus safety.}

The accident data were drawn from the official police crash report database of the UK spanning a period between 2010 and 2018. Correlated random parameter ordered probit models with heterogeneity in the means were developed in order to account for the multi-layered impact of unobserved heterogeneity on statistical estimation. The model estimation results showed that the severities of accident injuries are affected by roadway, location, weather, vehicle, and driver characteristics as well as temporal attributes (including time and day of the accident). Factors such as the urban context, lighting and weather conditions and road surface conditions were found to result in correlated random parameters, thus capturing the intricate, yet interactive effects of unobserved heterogeneity, and particularly the unobserved behavioural response of road users to different traffic control types at junctions and crossings. Vehicle type, driver’s gender and day-of-the-week were observed to influence the random parameters' distributions. Empirically, the results showcase variations in the determinants of injury severities at signalised and unsignalised junctions, and at physically-controlled and human-controlled crossings. Even though most of these variations were related to the magnitude of impact of the determinants, differences in the directional effects on injury severities were also identified, mainly for factors related to weather conditions, hazard presence on the road, and temporal characteristics of the accidents.}

abstract = {Until recently, statistical approaches used for real-time crash prediction modeling were limited to case-control design and “sampling of alternatives” approaches. A recent study has developed a duration-based real-time crash prediction model capable of incorporating dynamic (time-varying) covariates within its framework. The modeling approach discretizes the duration between crashes into equal time intervals which can be modeled as alternatives in a multinomial logit framework. The approach, however, requires a reformulation of the original crash dataset to fit its modeling framework which results in considerably large data making model estimation computationally demanding. Additionally, validation of the model in the original study is based on crash data from just one interstate, I-405, assuming homogenous highway segments each 5 miles in length. This study improves upon the original study by investigating sampling techniques that can be applied to the reformulated data to reduce computational load using 2019 crash data from two interstates, I-40 and I-55, in Memphis, Tennessee. Furthermore, discretization of inter-crash duration is undertaken following non-homogenous segmentation of the interstates that is based on highway geometry, terrain, and posted speed limit. To accomplish the study objectives, a relatively small future window of 1 h with 15-minute time intervals is used to discretize the inter-crash duration and obtain the reformulated data. Sampling of crashes for model estimation is then done at the crash, epoch, and segment levels to answer the question of which sampling technique (by crash, epoch, or segment) would result in reasonable accuracy when compared with the complete (100%) data. Results show that 25% of samples drawn at the epoch level can result in a considerable reduction of computational load while providing reasonably consistent estimates.}

abstract = {Urban arterials form the main structure of city street networks, and typically have high traffic volume and high crash frequency. To reduce the number of crashes, hotspot identification (HSID) is the first step in the traffic safety management process, and often utilizes crash prediction models. Classical crash prediction models investigate the relationship between roadway characteristics and traffic safety at the micro level, that is, they treat road segments and intersections as isolated units. Micro-level analysis has limitations, however, when examining urban arterial crashes: 1) signal spacing is typically short for urban arterials in dense street networks, and there are interactions between intersections and road segments that classical models do not accommodate; and 2) for practical engineering, a hotspot to which countermeasures are applied generally consists of several adjacent intersections and road segments instead of a single intersection or road segment. To address these concerns, signalized intersections and their adjacent road segments were combined into meso-level units, which were adopted to investigate traffic safety data from 21 urban arterials in Shanghai, China. To determine if the meso-level unit is the most suitable research unit for identifying hotspots on urban arterials, and if so, which HSID method can most consistently identify them, this study identified micro-level (separate intersection and road segment) and meso-level (combined intersection and road segment) hotspots using crash frequency, empirical Bayesian (EB), potential for safety improvement (PSI), and full Bayesian (FB) methods. To evaluate the performance of the HSID methods, hotspot consistency over two years was tested. The results showed that 1) EB and PSI performed better than the other methods no matter which research unit was used; 2) substantial inconsistency between the identified micro- and meso-level hotspots. To identify both hazardous corridors and individual intersections and road segments on urban arterials, a combination of micro- and meso-level hotspots should be recommended to local transportation authorities.}

However, few previous methods consider user perception toward the accidents and congestion in finding and profiling the accident- and congestion-prone areas, leaving decision-makers unaware of the subsequent behavior responses and priorities of retrofitting measures. This study develops a framework to identify and characterize the accident- and congestion-prone areas heatedly discussed on social media. First, we use natural language processing and deep learning to detect the accident- and congestion-relevant Chinese microblogs posted on Sina Weibo, a Chinese social media platform. Then a modified Kernel Density Estimation method considering the sentiment of microblogs is employed to find the accident- and congestion-prone regions. The results show that the 'congestion-prone areas' discussed on social media are mainly distributed throughout the historical urban core and the Northwest of Pudong New Area, in reasonably good agreements with actual congestion records. In contrast, the 'accident-prone areas' are primarily found in locations with severe accidents. Finally, the above venues are characterized in spatio-temporal and semantic aspects to understand the nature of the incidents and assess the priority level for mitigation measures. The outcomes can provide a reference for traffic authorities to inform resource allocation and prioritize mitigation measures in future traffic management.}

A sample of Malaysian drivers (N = 482; 44.6% were men and 55.4% women), with the average age of 36.7 years (SD = 10.0) was surveyed. The self-report questionnaire contained multiple observations nested within individual drivers, with respect to 3 different driving violations. As predicted, multi-level modelling showed that within-person predictor variables of all the TPB components emerged as independent predictors, with injunctive norm being the most predictive variable, followed by self-efficacy and cognitive attitude. Intention was also predicted by moral norms and crash history. Between-person variables, gender, commuting hours and work-family conflict also had direct influences on intention (i.e., men and those with longer commuting hours and higher work-family conflict reported lower intentions). Substantial support for the mediation model was found, confirming that stressors indirectly influence intentions through effects on the social cognitive components. The implications of the linkage between the social cognition and stressors for developing potential broader interventions focusing on multiple violation behaviours and designing appropriate safety policies to reduce commuting crashes are discussed.}

Calling, texting, or watching videos while driving could have harmful impacts on driving abilities and increase crash-injury severities. To investigate the temporal stability and the heterogeneity of cellphone-involved crash injury severity determinants, a series of likelihood ratio tests and random parameters logit models with heterogeneity in means and variances are estimated. Cellphone-involved single-vehicle crash datasets of Pennsylvania from 2004 to 2019 are utilized. Marginal effects are also applied to investigate the impact of explanatory variables on injury severity outcomes. The results indicate an overall temporal instability of cellphone-involved crashes across different periods. However, driving without seatbelts and overturns are observed to produce relatively stable and positive influence on the increased injury severities of cellphone-involved crashes. Besides, it is noteworthy that a combination of cellphone usage with risky driving behaviors (aggressive driving, alcohol- or drug-related driving, speeding, or fatigue driving) significantly increase driver injury-severities. This finding highlights the necessity of identifying drivers with multiple risk-taking behaviors and enacting laws to prohibit these drivers from using cellphones while driving. Applications of smartphones provide another feasible approach to prevent using cellphones while driving. Insights and suggestions of this study would be valuable to mitigate the negative outcomes of cellphone-involved crashes and prevent the crashes caused by cellphone-involved distracted driving in the future.}

Geometric parameters of 3D curvature and torsion in mathematics are derived to characterize the 3D road curve. Based on the coordination of different horizontal and vertical elements, 3D road alignment is divided into twelve types of combined alignment. For each alignment combination, the 3D curvature and torsion are calculated according to the differential geometry theory. Regarding crash statistical modeling, the Bayesian spatial Tobit (BST) model is developed to accommodate possible spatial correlation of traffic crashes among adjacent freeway segments. The Bayesian Tobit (BT) model is also built for comparison. A 118-km mountainous freeway associated road geometric features, traffic volume with three years of crash data is used as a case study. The result from the model comparison shows the BST model outperforms the BT model in terms of goodness-of-fit. Parameter estimation result for the BST model shows that the differences of average 3D curvature (and torsion) between adjacent segments have statistically significant effects on the crash rate of the segment, indicating it is necessary to consider three-dimensional alignment parameters in estimating mountainous freeway crash rate. Moreover, by comparing the predicted crash rate calculated by the BST model and the observed crash rate, the result shows the proposed BST model can provide a reliable prediction for freeway crash rates of different combined alignments. This study provides new insight on the effect of road geometric design on traffic safety but also deepens our understanding of spatial correlations in freeway crash modeling.}

We propose to use differencing of the (spatially adjacent) variables to reduce the effect of omitted variable bias. Differencing is a linear transformation that preserves the structure of the (generalized) linear model but can often result in significantly reducing the correlation between the variables. It is special case of (generalized) partial linear model regression which itself is a special case of a generalized additive model (GAM). In the spatial context used in this paper, differencing is similar to the well-known approach of including a spatial correlation structure (spatial error term) in the analysis of crash data. It is generally not clear how to interpret the results of models that include a spatial correlation structure and whether and how the added spatial correlation structure reduces the bias in the estimated regression parameters. However, for the case of differencing, it becomes clear how the effect of omitted variable bias is reduced by reducing the correlation between the variable of interest and the omitted variables. The order of differencing determines the dominant spatial scales of the variables considered in the model which affect how much the correlation is reduced. This reveals that omitted variable bias can be reduced when there are spatial scales at which the covariate of interest varies but the omitted variables either 1) are relatively homogeneous or 2) have variations that are not correlated to those of the variable of interest.}

abstract = {Traffic conflict techniques represent the state-of-the-art for road safety assessments. However, the lack of research on transferability of conflict-based crash risk models, which refers to applying the developed crash risk estimation models to a set of external sites, can reduce their appeal for large-scale traffic safety evaluations. Therefore, this study investigates the transferability of multivariate peak-over threshold models for estimating crash frequency-by-severity. In particular, the study proposes two transferability approaches: (i) an uncalibrated approach involving a direct application of the uncalibrated base model to the target sites and (ii) a threshold calibration approach involving calibration of conflict thresholds of the conflict indicators. In the latter approach, the conflict thresholds of the Modified Time-To-Collision (MTTC) and Delta-V indicators were calibrated using local data from the target sites. Finally, the two transferability approaches were compared with a complete re-estimation approach where all the model parameters were estimated using local data. All three approaches were tested for a target set of signalized intersections in Southeast Queensland, Australia. Traffic movements at the target intersections were observed using video cameras for two days (12 h each day). The road user trajectories and rear-end conflicts were extracted using an automated artificial intelligence-based algorithm utilizing state-of-the-art Computer Vision methods. The base models developed in an earlier study were then transferred to the target sites using the two transferability approaches and the local data from the target sites. Results show that the threshold calibration approach provides the most accurate and precise predictions of crash frequency-by-severity for target sites. Thus, for peak-over threshold models, the threshold parameter is the most important, and its calibration improves the performance of the base models. The complete re-estimation of models for individual target sites yields inferior fits and less precise crash estimates than the two transferability approaches since they utilize fewer traffic conflict extremes in their development than the larger dataset utilized in base model development. Therefore, the study results can significantly advance the applicability of traffic conflict models for crash risk estimation at transport facilities.}

abstract = {Pedestrians may be the most vulnerable group among road users, and mobile phone use while crossing the street is ubiquitous worldwide in this information era. However, previous studies have found that such distracting behaviors may increase the risk of injury and death. The present study primarily aimed to explore the effect of reinforcement sensitivity theory components (i.e., Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS), Behavioral Approach System (BAS)), risk perception, attitudes towards red light running, and fear of missing out (FoMO) on mobile phone use while crossing the street among pedestrians. Risk perception was measured in three ways (i.e., assessing the probability of a negative outcome (RP-Pro), judging the severity of the consequence (RP-Se), and evaluating the general riskiness of the behavior (RP-Ri)). An online questionnaire survey was conducted, and only valid responses (N = 425) were used for subsequent data analyses. The results indicated significant differences in the responses across the risk perception questions with different focuses. Participants who reported engaging in more distracted street-crossing (i.e., high-risk takers) perceived a significantly lower risk, and this difference did not depend on the focus of risk perception. Three path analysis models with differential risk perception constructs (RP-Pro, RP-Se, and RP-Ri) were developed to examine the relationship between risk perception and distracted street-crossing. The results suggest that the relationship between these two variables does not depend on the focus of the risk perception questions. Moreover, FoMO was a predictor of mobile phone use while crossing the street, while attitudes had both direct and indirect effects on behavior. BIS and BAS had the lowest total effect on mobile phone use among pedestrians. In particular, a direct association between BAS and distracted street-crossing was found only in the model in which risk perception was measured by judging the severity of crashes caused by mobile phone use distraction. This study may be meaningful for understanding the associations between psychological factors and mobile phone use among pedestrians. The implications of the findings for the development of safety interventions are discussed in this study.}

abstract = {The expected crash frequency is the long-term average crash count for a specific site. It is extensively used to systematically evaluate the crash risk associated with roadway elements. To estimate the expected crashes, the Empirical Bayesian (EB) approach is typically employed. The EB method is a computationally convenient approximation to the Full Bayesian (FB) method, which gained popularity due to its simple interpretation, computational efficiency, and the ability to account for the regression to the mean bias. However, the common EB method used in traffic safety analysis is only applicable when the traditional Negative Binomial (NB) model is used. The NB model, however, is not a suitable choice when data is highly dispersed, skewed, or has a large number of zero observations. The Negative Binomial-Lindley (NB-L) model is a mixture of the NB and Lindley distributions and has shown superior fit compared to the NB model, especially when the dataset is characterized by excess zero observations. Even though several studies have used the NB-L in developing crash prediction models, the application of the NB-L in other safety-related tasks (e.g., hot spot identification) is largely neglected. This study proposed a framework to develop the EB method for the NB-L model and subsequently estimate the expected crash values. A comparison between the EB and FB estimates was performed to validate the approximation framework in general. The results indicated that the proposed EB framework is able to estimate expected crashes with comparable precision to the FB estimate, but with much less computational cost. In addition, a site ranking analysis using the EB estimates was conducted to validate the proposed approximation method in safety studies. However, it should be noted that any other type of safety analysis that requires access to the expected crashes can benefit from the proposed EB method. This study concluded that the proposed EB framework can properly approximate the underlying FB approach and can reasonably be considered as an alternative to the traditional EB formula derived from the NB model. The results of this study can help to extend the application of the advanced predictive models beyond predicting crashes to other safety-related tasks, with no additional computational efforts.}

abstract = {Drowsiness and distraction are major factors of road crashes and responsible of>35% of road fatalities. Automated driving could solve or minimize their impact, yet it is also in itself a way to promote them. Previous literature reviews and meta-analysis regarding take-overs during automated driving primarily focused on distraction rather than drowsiness. We thus present a systematic and meta-analysis literature review focused on the effect of distraction and drowsiness on take-over performance. From an initial selection of 1896 articles from databases, we obtained by applying systematic review methodology a total of 58 articles with 42 articles dedicated to distraction and 17 articles related to drowsiness. According to our analysis, we demonstrated that distraction and drowsiness increased the take-over request reaction time (TOR-RT), which could also lead to a reduction of the quality of take-overs. In addition, this longer reaction time was even more important in the case of handheld non-driving related tasks, which is important to consider as phone use is among the most frequent tasks done during automated driving. On a more methodological aspect, we also demonstrated that take-over time budget had a significant effect on TOR-RT. However, it is difficult to estimate to what extend distraction and drowsiness could impact the take-over quality, even if several elements supported safety issues. We underpinned several limits of the current methodologies applied in the study of distraction and drowsiness such as (i) the lack of additional measures related to the take-over quality (e.g., accelerations, collision rate), (ii) the many different methodologies applied to the determination of the TOR-RT (e.g., deactivation by the steering wheel, pedals, button), (iii) the high frequency of take-over requests which can lead to habituation effects, (iv) the lack of control conditions, (v) the fact that the level of drowsiness was relatively low in most studies. We thus highlighted recommendations for a better estimation of the effect of distraction and drowsiness on take-over performance. Further studies should adopt more standardized measures of TOR-RT and additional take-over quality measures, try minimizing the number of take-over requests, and carefully consider the time budget available for the use case since it influences the TOR-RT. Regarding distraction, researchers should consider the impact of tasks requiring handholding items. Concerning drowsiness, further protocols should consider the non-linearity of drowsiness and presence of micro sleeps and favor take-over requests based on drowsiness level protocols rather than on fixed duration protocols.}

However, NDD requires a high amount of manual labor to label certain driver’s state and behavioral patterns. Unsupervised analysis of NDD can be used to automatically detect different patterns from the driver and vehicle data. In this paper, we propose a methodology to understand changes in driver’s physiological responses within different driving patterns. Our methodology first decomposes a driving scenario by using a Bayesian Change Point detection model. We then apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation method on both driver state and behavior data to detect patterns. We present two case studies in which vehicles were equipped to collect exterior, interior, and driver behavioral data. Four patterns of driving behaviors (i.e., harsh brake, normal brake, curved driving, and highway driving), as well as two patterns of driver’s heart rate (HR) (i.e., normal vs. abnormal high HR), and gaze entropy (i.e., low versus high), were detected in these two case studies. The findings of these case studies indicated that among our participants, the drivers’ HR had a higher fraction of abnormal patterns during harsh brakes, accelerating and curved driving. Additionally, free-flow driving with close to zero accelerations on the highway was accompanied by more fraction of normal HR as well as a lower gaze entropy pattern. With the proposed methodology we can better understand variations in driver’s psychophysiological states within different driving scenarios. The findings of this work, has the potential to guide future autonomous vehicles to take actions that are fit to each specific driver.}

Among these, longitudinal designs (k = 3) and studies using objective driving performance measures (e.g., simulators) (k = 2) were rare. Most studies (k = 18) relied on brief screener measures of PTSD status/symptoms or a prior chart diagnosis, while few used a standardized structured interview measure to determine PTSD status (k = 4), and only a small number of studies assessed PTSD symptom clusters (k = 7). PTSD was most frequently associated with increased rates of hostile driving behaviors (e.g., cutting off others), unintentional driving errors (e.g., lapses in attention) and negative thoughts and emotions experienced behind the wheel. Findings regarding risk of motor vehicle accident and driving-related legal issues were variable, however relatively few studies (k = 5) explored these constructs. Future directions are discussed, including the need for work focused on concurrent PTSD symptom/driving-related changes, more comprehensive PTSD and driving assessment, and consideration of the contributions of comorbid traumatic brain injury history and other neurological and psychiatric conditions on driving outcomes.}

However, few studies have investigated how brain activities change during overtaking. Moreover, the learning process, which indicates the heterogeneity of drivers from a process-based perspective, has been neglected. In this work, we studied varied overtaking and learning styles using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals collected from drivers during a simulated driving task with a possible learning process. The average speed, standard deviation of speed, steering wheel angle and lateral movement distance of overtaking behaviors are analyzed in these reinforced tasks to evaluate overtaking performance. Four types of overtaking styles (i.e., low-speed type, low-speed \& strong-oscillation type, high-speed \& strong-steering type, and high-speed \& close-distance type) and three types of learning styles (i.e., stable, adaptive and changeful) are discovered, not only from eventual overtaking behaviors but also from behavioral changes in a certain learning process. EEG features, such as the power spectral density (PSD) in the θ, α, β and γ bands, are extracted to characterize driver mental states and to correlate with heterogeneous learning styles. The obtained results show that fatigue and fatigue confrontation are more likely with a stable learning style, and the mental workload is reduced with an adaptive learning style, whereas no significant changes in brain activity are apparent with a changeful learning style. Understanding and recognizing heterogeneous overtaking and learning styles with varying EEG patterns will be extremely useful in the future for deep integration of advanced driving assistance systems (ADASs) and brain computer interface (BCI) systems.}

The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of anger and happiness on the driving behaviour of drivers who encounter a pedestrian-crossing event on an unmarked road, which requires strategic and behavioural choices. Thirty-nine drivers completed a simulated driving task to avoid pedestrians under the influence of state emotion. The results showed that anger increased the average driving speed, the minimum speed when encountering a pedestrian, the probability of passing in front of a pedestrian, and the lateral distance to the pedestrian from the right. However, there was no difference between the impacts of happy and neutral moods on driving behaviour. These results suggest that general risky driving behaviour (e.g., speeding) is mainly affected by anger state. Meanwhile avoidance behaviour patterns in pedestrian-crossing tasks, as a driving behaviour related to prosocial attitudes, are also affected by emotional valence. Recommendations and implications for further research on driving anger are discussed.}

This research aims to analyze real-time safety by a disaggregate study and explore the benefit of the connected vehicle (CV) for real-time safety evaluation. To avoid the endogeneity problem regarding conflicts and traffic features in regression models, machine learning is employed to obtain a reliable and practical real-time safety model. The results show that the Random Forest outperforms eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine and Adaptive Boosting models, achieving the best performance with the highest AUC of 0.827. For a deep understanding of conflict mechanisms, the explainable machine learning method SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanation) is introduced to improve the model interpretability providing insights into the impacts of traffic flow features. Lane difference regarding average speed is found to have the most significant impacts on real-time safety. Speed variation, the proportion of trucks and traffic volume are associated with conflict occurrence. Further analysis highlights that the impacts of traffic features are heterogeneous and there may exist specific patterns of paired features affecting real-time safety. Encouragingly, SHAP appears to be able to complement the traditional model with random components in terms of revealing heterogeneity. The explainable machine learning can also provide a solid basis for discretizing continuous variables while previous studies perform discretization mainly based on prior knowledge and experience. The experimental result regarding CV Market Penetration Rate (CV-MPR) demonstrates that the model performance is gradually elevated with the increase of penetration rate. The initial stage of the CV market (20%, 40% CV-MPR) yields the most significant gains in real-time safety evaluation. These findings can be used beneficially in active traffic management.}

This paper proposes a conflict-based approach for travel route safety estimation (TRSE). It is developed on the basis of the classical safety evaluation model where both the amount of exposure to safety risk and the risk under unit exposure are measured to estimate the route safety. A combination of a set of dynamic and static factors related to traffic flow characteristics and roadway features are selected to estimate conflict exposure and potential conflict risk. A route-based method is employed where two parallel estimations of conflict are conducted for both the component segments links and intersection turning links. Three machine learning models (i.e., random forest, k-nearest neighbor, and support vector machine) are tested in conflict risk estimation. A fuzzy reasoning process based on the fuzzy logic algorithm is employed to conduct the route safety estimation. The proposed TRSE is tested on a four-horizontal and six-vertical network extracted from a real road network in China. Conflict simulation results were obtained by Vissim and SSAM tools. The results illustrate the practicability and effectiveness of the proposed TRSE approach.}

Unfortunately, this perception is accurate in many places, and protected cycle lanes have been advocated as a possible solution. Although some research shows that people tend to feel safer in them, there have been conflicting results regarding protected cycle lanes’ safety benefits. Understanding the reasons protected cycle lanes may actually reduce safety is key to promoting active transport modes. One possible reason crash rates may increase is that cyclists may cycle faster in them due to either a decreased mental workload or from reduced perceptions of risk. In the present research, two studies were conducted to examine cyclists’ speeds and perceptions of difficulty and safety in both protected and unprotected cycle lanes, as well as streets with no cycle lanes. The first study was an online questionnaire using short video clips from a cyclist’s perspective, and the second study was an on-road experiment with a post-ride questionnaire. The studies found that cyclists felt safer with protected cycle lanes, were more willing to allow their children to bike on them and showed less concern towards hazards. There was no evidence of decreased attentional demand while using the protected cycle lanes, but there was some evidence of higher maximum cycling speeds.}

Pedestrians as vulnerable road users heavily rely on the communication with other road users, especially for the interaction with larger vehicles, as miscommunication pose a high risk. Therefore, AVs need to provide communication abilities to safely interact with pedestrians. This study’s focus was on the explicit communication which is highly relevant in low-speed and low-distance traffic scenarios to clarify misunderstandings before they result in accidents. External human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) placed on the outside of AVs can be used as a communication tool to explicitly inform the surrounding traffic environment. Although research manifested effects of vehicle size on pedestrians’ perceived safety and crossing behavior, little research about the eHMI design for differently sized AVs exists. This experimental online study (N = 155) aimed at investigating the application of a light-based eHMI on two differently sized AVs (car, bus) by focusing on the overall goal of ensuring traffic safety in future traffic. The light-based eHMI showed different communication strategies, i.e., a static eHMI and three dynamic eHMIs. The results revealed that an automated car was perceived as safer and affectively rated as more positive compared to an automated bus. Nevertheless, no significant differences were found between the two AVs in terms of the eHMI communication. A dynamic eHMI was perceived as safer and evaluated affectively as more positive compared to a static eHMI or no eHMI for both AVs. In conclusion, the use of a light-based eHMI had a positive effect on pedestrians’ interaction with an automated car and an automated bus and, therefore, could contribute to the overall traffic safety in this study. Implications for the design of eHMIs for differently sized AVs were discussed.}

We found that pedestrian injury trends varied based on important decisions related to how the CPP is designed, including investments in potential safety-related supports for pedestrians. Infrastructure improvements and speed management interventions could help cities achieve both congestion-relieving goals while also improving safety. Additionally, certain CPP configurations (e.g., additional charges on for-hire vehicles) could further reduce daily vehicle trips and congestion but might lead to unintended negative safety consequences of greater pedestrian injuries. This is the first model to provide a holistic and endogenous look at how interconnected processes affecting congestion and CPP impacts also affect vulnerable road user safety. The use of system dynamics models can facilitate a holistic inspection of potential intended and unintended effects across a range of outcomes, prior to policy implementation.}

Anomaly detection in driving behavior means recognizing anomalous driving states as a direct result of either environmental or psychological factors. This paper provides an efficient anomaly recognition approach to identify anomalous lane-changing events in a personalized manner. The proposed framework includes three unsupervised algorithms. First, a Recurrent-Convolutional Autoencoder extracts the spatio-temporal characteristics from a high-dimensional naturalistic driving dataset. Second, in order to recognize anomalous lane-changing events of individual drivers, the extracted latent feature space is analyzed using Pauta criterion-based reconstruction loss analysis, as well as one-class Support Vector Machine. Last, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding is employed to visualize the latent space for better understanding and interpretability. Temporal anomalies of lane-changing events were analyzed by a personalized grey relational coefficient analysis, to represent robust similarities for individual drivers. Validation and calibration were performed with a natural driving study dataset collected from 50 drivers with 59,372 lane change events. The results showed heterogeneity in the pattern of abnormal lane changing behavior across the sample. At the same time, each driver exhibited heterogeneous anomalous behaviors in both temporal and spatial sequences. Without prior labels, the proposed model effectively captures personalized driving patterns and abnormal lane-changing events from high-dimensional time-series data. This unsupervised hybrid approach is a novel attempt to complete personalized anomalous lane-changing behaviors identification based on naturalistic driving data involving various traffic environments. Our approach enables the extraction of natural individual lane-changing behavior patterns and provides insights for the improvement of personalized driving behavior monitoring systems.}

abstract = {During conditionally automated driving, drivers are sometimes required to take over control of the vehicle if a so-called takeover request (TOR) is issued. TORs are generally issued due to system limitations. This study investigated the effect of different urgency scenarios and takeover-request lead times (TORlts) on takeover performance and safety. The experiment was conducted in a real vehicle-based driving simulator. Manual driving, 7-second TORlt and 5-second TORlt were each tested. Participants experienced three progressively urgent driving scenarios: one cut-in scenario and two obstacle-avoidance scenarios. The results indicate that the TORlt significantly affected takeover performance and safety. Within a certain range, the longer the TORlt, the safer the takeover. However, while takeover reaction time depended mainly on the length of the TORlt and was not significantly related to other factors, such as workload, greater workloads that were caused by the TORlt were associated with shorter reaction times and decreased safety. This is evidence that the reaction time should not be used as the preferred indicator to evaluate takeover performance and safety. Indicators, such as workload, minimum TTC, feature point distribution position and slope of the obstacle avoidance trajectory, can better measure and evaluate takeover performance and safety. This study can provide data support for takeover safety evaluation of conditionally automated driving.}

This study applied Bayesian spatiotemporal models for the identification of the DVC hotspots. The Bayesian spatiotemporal model allows to observe area-specific trends in the DVC data and highlights specific locations where DVC occurrence is deteriorating or improving over time. Census Tracts (CTs) were used as the geographic units to aggregate DVC, land use, and transportation infrastructure related data of Minnesota (MN) for the year 2015 to 2019. Several tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of the hotspot identification methods. The result showed that Type-I spatiotemporal interaction model (Model-2) outperforms other four space–time models in terms of predicting DVC frequency in CTs and hotspot identification performance test measures. Results showed that forest area, vegetation, and wetland percentages were positively associated with DVC frequency, whereas the percentage of developed land use was negatively associated with DVC frequency. The findings of this study suggest that the deer population plays an important role in DVCs, which indicates that deer population management is necessary to minimize the DVC risks. Using the final Type-I spatiotemporal interaction model, 65 “High-High” CTs were identified, where both the posterior mean of the decision parameter (potential for safety improvement) and the area-specific trend were higher. The distribution of the identified hotspots showed that the risk of DVCs was more in suburban areas with mixed land use conditions. These CTs represent high-risk zones, which need immediate safety improvement measures to reduce the DVC risks. As DVC can occur at any roadway segment location, DVC hotspots information is important for safety engineers and policymakers to implement area specific countermeasures.}

abstract = {Right-turn movements (equivalent to left turn movements for countries that drive on the right) at intersections are among the most complex driving maneuvers and require a high level of attention for turning across (potentially) oncoming traffic by accepting a safe gap. Not surprisingly, right-turn-involved crashes are one of the most frequent collision types at intersections (e.g., 42% of all signalised intersection crashes in Queensland, Australia). Unfortunately, the causes and contributing factors to right-turn crashes are not well understood, particularly the effect of right-turn signal strategies on the crash risk. In the safety literature, signal strategies are coarsely considered in two generic categories-protected right-turns and permitted right-turns. In reality, right-turn signal strategies could be of various types (usually 5) based on the level of intersection complexity and potential traffic conflicts. The effects of these signal strategies, along with the geometric and traffic factors, have not been well studied. To fill this gap, this study investigates the effects of right-turn signal strategies, intersection geometry and traffic operations factors on right-turn crashes at signalised intersections. To achieve this aim, crash frequency models were estimated using crash data from 221 signalised intersections in Queensland from the years spanning 2012 to 2018. Hierarchical Poisson Regression Models (random intercept models) were employed to capture the hierarchical structure of influences on crashes, with upper-level capturing intersection characteristics and lower-level capturing approach characteristics. The hierarchical model structure, disaggregate exposure variables, and signal strategies examined in this study give rise to an entirely unique study in the literature.}

abstract = {Objective
The study aims to model driver perception across the visual field in dynamic, real-world highway driving.
Background
Peripheral vision acquires information across the visual field and guides a driver’s information search. Studies in naturalistic settings are lacking however, with most research having been conducted in controlled simulation environments with limited eccentricities and driving dynamics.
Methods
We analyzed data from 24 participants who drove a Tesla Model S with Autopilot on the highway. While driving, participants completed the peripheral detection task (PDT) using LEDs and the N-back task to generate cognitive load. The I-DT (identification by dispersion threshold) algorithm sampled naturalistic gaze fixations during PDTs to cover a broader and continuous spectrum of eccentricity. A generalized Bayesian regression model predicted LED detection probability during the PDT—as a surrogate for peripheral vision—in relation to eccentricity, vehicle speed, driving mode, cognitive load, and age.
Results
The model predicted that LED detection probability was high and stable through near-peripheral vision but it declined rapidly beyond 20°-30° eccentricity, showing a narrower useful field over a broader visual field (maximum 70°) during highway driving. Reduced speed (while following another vehicle), cognitive load, and older age were the main factors that degraded the mid-peripheral vision (20°-50°), while using Autopilot had little effect.
Conclusions
Drivers can reliably detect objects through near-peripheral vision, but their peripheral detection degrades gradually due to further eccentricity, foveal demand during low-speed vehicle following, cognitive load, and age.
Applications
The findings encourage the development of further multivariate computational models to estimate peripheral vision and assess driver situation awareness for crash prevention.}

abstract = {Over the past few years, the number of fatalities and severe injuries of vulnerable road users, particularly pedestrians, has risen substantially. Clearly, the safe mobility of pedestrians is critical in our transportation system. Technology can help reduce vehicle–pedestrian crashes, fatalities, and injuries. Emerging technologies such as pedestrian crash prevention (PCP) systems utilized in on-road vehicles have the potential to mitigate pedestrian crash severity or prevent crashes. However, the reliability and effectiveness of these technologies have remained uncertain. This study contributes toward understanding the effectiveness of PCP systems utilized in on-road vehicles with a low level of automation by investigating two crossing and one longitudinal scenarios. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety field test data from 2018 to 2021 is harnessed, where several on-road vehicles and their PCP systems are evaluated in terms of safety. The large-scale experimental dataset is comprised of 3095 tests of 91 vehicles with different sizes, makes, and models. The empirical results indicate that in hazardous pedestrian-vehicle conflict situations, the performance of PCP systems has been improved during recent years. The test data shows that some pedestrians were undetected in some tests, but on average, in 70% of the tests, the PCP systems avoided pedestrian crashes. However, for the occurred crashes, PCP systems, on average, were able to mitigate impact speeds of >50%. In real-life situations, this could translate to substantial reductions in injury and fatality risk. Through rigorous analysis, the associations of key factors in the studied scenarios and the performance of PCP systems are explored and discussed in this paper. The modeling results show that increasing the maximum deceleration rate of the PCP system and lower weight of vehicles can significantly improve the performance of the PCP system by decreasing the speed at impact with pedestrians. The average maximum deceleration utilized in PCP systems has been increased over time from 7.48 m/s2 in 2018 to 9.36 m/s2 in 2021. This can be one of the reasons behind the improvement of PCP systems during recent years.}

However, there have been limited studies on the effects of the design of travel lane configuration and lane width on safety in such a mixed traffic environment. It’s true the above-mentioned research question can be evaluated simply in terms of the number of crashes. However, doing so not only requires a few years of crash and traffic data, but limited insight can be gained in terms of how driver and rider behaviours are affected, and this has implications for further improvement in road safety. This study examines the changes in driving/riding behaviours and surrogate events before and after the adjustments of travel lane configuration and lane width by proposing a micro perspective approach as a complement to conventional studies. A before-and-after site-based investigation was conducted at two study sites which had opposite adjustments for travel lane configuration and lane widths: at one site the number of lanes was reduced, thereby widening the lane width in the outer lane on one road section, and at the second site the number of lanes was increased, thereby narrowing lane width in the outer lane on the other road section. The results showed that an increase in lane width resulted in a considerable increase in the number of speeding events as well as unsafe driving/riding behaviours and surrogate events related to lane splitting, lane sharing, and overtaking.}

Automatic emergency braking (AEB) that detects pedestrians has great potential to reduce pedestrian crashes. The objective of this study was to examine its effects on real-world police-reported crashes.
Methods
Two methods were used to assess the effects of pedestrian-detecting AEB on pedestrian crash risk. Vehicles with and without the system were examined on models where it was an optional feature. Poisson regression was used to estimate the effects of AEB on pedestrian crash rates per insured vehicle year, and quasi-induced exposure using logistic regression compared involvement in pedestrian crashes to a system-irrelevant crash type.
Results
AEB with pedestrian detection was associated with significant reductions of 25%–27% in pedestrian crash risk and 29%–30% in pedestrian injury crash risk. However, there was not evidence that that the system was effective in dark conditions without street lighting, at speed limits of 50 mph or greater, or while the AEB-equipped vehicle was turning.
Conclusions
Pedestrian-detecting AEB is reducing pedestrian crashes, but its effectiveness could be even greater. For the system to make meaningful reductions in pedestrian fatalities, it is crucial for it to work well in dark and high-speed conditions. Other proven interventions to reduce pedestrian crashes under challenging circumstances, such as improved headlights and roadway-based countermeasures, should continue to be implemented in conjunction with use of AEB to prevent pedestrian crashes most effectively.}

This study evaluates the influence of different visual guiding facilities on drivers’ spatial right-of-way perception by combining quantitative and qualitative methods in order to provide a basis for traffic safety optimization in the tunnel. Simulation scenes were designed for six common types of visual guiding facilities as comprising no facility (baseline), horizontal strips, edge markers, LED arch, vertical stripes, and combination (multiple) facilities. An eye tracker was used to obtain eye movement data of subject drivers exposed to various scenes. After each driving test, psychological feeling of the subjects in tunnel driving, and their ratings of alignment and contour guidance of various facilities were obtained by questionnaires. The research results showed that setting locations and facility types have a great impact on drivers’ glance location and glance duration. When horizontal stripes, edge markers, LED arch and vertical stripes were set separately, alignment guidance and contour guidance performance were found to vary in inverse proportion. Horizontal stripes and edge markers are the preferred and necessary facilities, which are conducive to ensuring longitudinal and horizontal rights-of-way. LED arch and vertical stripes are also good supplements to spatial right-of-way. The combination of these 4 types of facilities can provide multi-level alignment guidance and contour guidance functions, which is beneficial to traffic safety in the tunnel.}

This study aims to investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the likelihood of severe crashes via changing driving behaviors. Multigroup structural equation modeling (SEM) is used to capture the complex interrelationships between crash injury severity, the context of COVID-19, driving behaviors, and other risk factors for two different groups, i.e., highways and non-highways. The SEM constructs two latent variables, namely aggressiveness and inattentiveness, which are indicated by risk driving behaviors such as speeding, drunk driving, and distraction. One great advantage of SEM is that the measurement of latent variables and interrelationship modeling can be achieved simultaneously in one statistical estimation procedure. Group differences between highways and non-highways are tested using different equality constraints and multigroup SEM with equal regressions can deliver the augmented performance. The smaller severity threshold for the highway group indicates that it is more likely that a crash could involve severe injuries on highways as compared to those on non-highways. Results suggest that aggressiveness and inattentiveness of drivers increased significantly after the outbreak of COVID-19, leading to a higher likelihood of severe crashes. Failing to account for the indirect effect of COVID-19 via changing driving behaviors, the conventional probit model suggests an insignificant impact of COVID-19 on crash severity. Findings of this study provide insights into the effect of changing driving behaviors on safety during disruptive events like COVID-19.}

Fortunately, studies have found that adopting safe driving behavior in a tunnel minimizes the severe outcomes of an incident. Therefore, implementing driver-oriented safety policies and conducting public awareness campaigns that emphasize safe behavior when driving through tunnels are essential. However, before devising policies and campaigns on the right issues, it is necessary to understand drivers' current level of knowledge regarding tunnel safety, their habits, behavioral intentions, and psychological condition while driving through tunnels. To achieve this objective, a sample of 841 responses was collected from China using a questionnaire survey consisting of fifty-two items. The results showed that several gaps exist in drivers' knowledge regarding tunnel safety and equipment. Drivers often adopt inappropriate habits and behaviors while driving through tunnels. Also, the tunnel environment has a significant influence on the psychological condition of the drivers. Moreover, drivers' demographic characteristics significantly affect their knowledge, reported habits and behavioral intentions, and psychological condition. The authorities and safety analysts could employ the suggestions highlighted in the present study for improving tunnel safety.}

However, the interactions between MVs and AVs, especially whether MVs will behave differently when following AVs compared to following MVs, have not been fully understood. Previous studies in this field mainly conducted traffic/numerical simulations or field experiments to investigate human drivers’ behavior changes, but these approaches all have critical drawbacks such as simplified driving environments and limited sample sizes. To fill in the knowledge gap, this study uses the high-resolution (10 Hz) Waymo Open Dataset to reveal differences in car-following behaviors between MV-following-AV and MV-following-MV cases. Driving volatility measures, time headways and time-to-collision (TTC) are adopted to quantify and compare MV-following-AV and MV-following-MV interactions. The principal component analysis (PCA) is applied on the high-dimensional feature space, followed by the hierarchical clustering on the dimension-reduced feature set to categorize MV driving styles when following AVs. The comparison results indicate that MV-following-AV events have lower driving volatility in terms of velocity and acceleration/deceleration, smaller time headways and higher TTC values. Furthermore, the clustering results reveal that human drivers when following AVs exhibit four different car-following styles: high-velocity-non-aggressive, high-velocity-aggressive, low-velocity-non-aggressive, and low-velocity-aggressive. These findings highlight the vital importance of taking into account the heterogeneity of MV-following-AV behaviors when designing mixed traffic control algorithms and can be beneficial for AV fleet operators to improve their algorithms.}

abstract = {Train-vehicle collisions at STOP-sign-controlled grade crossings attract many concerns in China and across the world. Researchers have demonstrated that the cost-effective approaches to improve grade crossing safety are the redesign of signs and pavement markings as well as the application of in-vehicle audio warning. However, the impacts of improved signs design and audio warning on drivers’ visual performance have barely been discussed. This study explored the effects of improved signs design and audio warning on drivers’ eye movement patterns and driving behavior at STOP-sign-controlled grade crossings, by conducting a driving simulator experiment. Three types of grade crossing scenarios: 1) the conventional signs design (Baseline), 2) improved signs design (PS), and 3) improved signs design and three-stage audio warning (PSW), were modeled in a driving simulation system and tested under a series of train TTC (no train, 4 s, 7 s, 10 s, 13 s) conditions. Foggy conditions and drivers’ characteristics, i.e., gender and vocation were considered in the experiment design. Seven variables describing both drivers’ fixation patterns and driving performance were collected and analyzed in this study, e.g., total fixation duration, distance to stop line at the first fixation, fixation transition probability, stop compliance, speed, maximum deceleration rate and minimum time-to-collision. Results revealed that the improved design of signs and the audio warning could prime drivers’ expectation of the grade crossing in advance since drivers could drive at a lower speed, perceive signs timely, and conduct an earlier visual search for the train with these countermeasures. Besides, in PS and PSW scenarios, drivers attached more importance to the STOP sign, and they were more cautious in estimating the time-to-arrival of the train by repeatedly fixating on these two areas. The improvement in fixation performance of drivers in PS and PSW contributed to a more comfortable deceleration. Compared with no warning scenarios, higher compliance rates were observed with audio warning, especially with a short train TTC (4 s and 7 s). However, no significant difference was found between PS and Baseline, indicating the limited safety benefits of improved signs design. Minimum time-to-collision for those drivers who ignored the warning did not increase significantly in both PS and PSW. Additionally, heavy fog limited drivers’ perception of signs and led to a later and shorter fixation. For gender effect, males had a lower fixation duration on the STOP sign and lower compliance rate than females. Moreover, female drivers could perceive the approaching train earlier than males, especially in PS and PSW. These findings suggested that the improved signs design and in-vehicle audio warning improved drivers’ visual and behavioral performance and had the potential to enhance safety at STOP-sign-controlled grade crossings.}

Specially, the safe and efficient following control strategy based on relative distance braking mode (RDBM) is one of the core technologies. This paper innovatively proposes a cooperative collision-avoidance control methodology, which can enhance the operation efficiency on the premise of ensuring the safety. Firstly, a novel framework for the RDBM based on the predicted trajectory of the preceding train is proposed for the train collision-avoidance control. To reduce the train following distance, a cooperative control model is further proposed and is formulated as a Markov decision process. Then, the Deep-Q-Network (DQN) algorithm is introduced to solve the efficient control problem by learning the safe and efficient control strategy for the following train where the critical elements of the reinforcement learning framework are designed. Finally, experimental simulations are conducted based on the simulated environment to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Compared with the absolute distance braking mode (ADBM), the minimum following distance between the adjacent trains can be reduced by 70.23% on average via the proposed approach while the safety can be guaranteed.}

abstract = {The statistical analysis was conducted on data of accident scenarios between cars and two-wheelers from National Automobile Accident In-depth Investigation System (NAIS) database in order to study safety of intended functionality of Autonomous emergency braking (AEB) perception system in typical dangerous scenarios of cars and two-wheelers. 11 scenario-related variables were selected, and 6 types of typical scenarios were obtained through cluster analysis and manual classification. The 6 types of typical scenarios were built by the automatic driving simulation software PreScan, and the AEB longitudinal control algorithm was built in Matlab/Simulink. Batch simulation script files were written, and the relative location distribution of car and two-wheeler with different time to collision (TTC) was obtained by batch simulation. Furthermore, the effects of car velocity, two-wheeler velocity and cyclist casualties on the parameter configuration of the perception system were analyzed. Under the premise of satisfying safety of intended functionality of the perception system, the optimal sensor detection scheme at different TTCs was obtained by comprehensively considering the death accident detection rate, detection area, and standard deviation. The results show that when the detection rate is 90%, the AEB system can adopt the detection scheme of long-range radar and short-range radar. The field of view (FOV) and detection range of the short range radar are 133.6° and 38.1 m, and those of the long range radar are 84.5° and 74.3 m. And when the detection rate was close to 100%, a single sensor can be used, and the detection parameters are 150° and 77.6 m. It provides reference for parameter optimization of AEB perception system.}

Specifically, real-time crash identification using vehicle operation data can enable automotive companies to obtain timely information on the safety of user vehicle usage so that timely customer service and roadside rescue can be provided. In this paper, an accurate vehicle crash identification algorithm is developed based on machine learning techniques using electric vehicles’ operation data provided by SAIC-GM-Wuling. The point of battery disconnection is identified as a potential crash event. Data before and after the battery disconnection is retrieved for feature extraction. Two different feature extraction methods are used: one directly extracts the descriptive statistical features of various variables, and the other directly unfolds the multivariate time series data. The AdaBoost algorithm is used to classify whether a potential crash event is a real crash using the constructed features. Models trained with the two different features are fused for the final outputs. The results show that the final model is simple, effective, and has a fast inference speed. The model has an F1 score of 0.98 on testing data for crash classification, and the identified crash times are all within 10 s around the true crash times.

abstract = {Cannabis is the second most commonly used impairing substance by drivers, after alcohol. As more countries legalize cannabis, there is concern that cannabis-impaired driving will increase. In many countries, police use roadside devices to test for oral fluid THC (the primary psychotropic component in cannabis) to identify drivers who used cannabis; including in countries with non-zero per se limits for THC in blood. This practice is questioned as previous research demonstrates a poor correlation between oral fluid and blood THC concentrations at the individual level. We conducted a meta-analysis to identify all research that compared oral fluid with blood THC levels. We obtained individual-level data from study authors and analyzed pooled individual-level data to calculate sensitivity and specificity of oral fluid THC (at various cut-off values) to detect blood THC above different concentration limits. Finally, we explored practical implications of using oral fluid THC in an enforcement context. Our review found THC concentrations measured in over 18,000 paired samples of oral fluid and blood. We found a good correlation between the presence of THC in oral fluid and presence of THC in blood (sensitivity = 71.2%, specificity = 97.7%). However oral fluid THC, at commonly used cut-off values, is less sensitive and less specific when used as a biomarker to detect people with blood THC concentrations above commonly used per se limits (such as 5 ng/mL). As such, there will be a large number of “false positive” tests if oral fluid THC testing were used as a biomarker for “illegal” THC concentrations in randomly selected drivers. We argue that the adverse implications of false positive oral fluid THC tests in this context outweigh the possible road safety benefits and we recommend against oral fluid THC screening in randomly selected drivers in countries with non-zero per se limits for blood THC. In contrast, oral fluid THC tests appear to be useful for investigating “high-risk” drivers who come to police attention because of evidence of impairment.}

abstract = {Pedestrian distraction may provoke severe difficulties in automated vehicle (AV) control, which may significantly affect the safety performance of AVs, especially at unsignalized mid-block crosswalks (UMCs). However, there is no available motion-planning model for AVs that considers the effect of pedestrian distraction on UMCs. This study aims to explore innovative approaches for safe and reasonable automated driving in response to distracted pedestrians with various speed profiles at UMCs. Based on two common model design concepts, two new models are established for AVs: a rule-based model that solves motion plans through a fixed calculation procedure incorporating several optimization models, and a learning-based model that replaces the deterministic optimization process with policy-gradient reinforcement learning. The developed models were assessed through simulation experiments in which pedestrian speed profiles were defined using empirical data from field surveys. The results reveal that the learning-based model has outstanding safety performance, whereas the rule-based model leads to remarkable safety problems. For distracted pedestrians with significant crossing-speed changes, rule-based AVs lead to a 5.1% probability of serious conflict and a 1.4% crash probability. The learning-based model is oversensitive to risk and always induces high braking rates, which results in unnecessary efficiency loss. To overcome this, a hybrid model based on the learning-based model was developed, which introduces a rule-based acceleration value to regularize the action space of the proposed learning-based model. The results indicate that the hybrid approach outperforms the other two models in preventing crash hazards from distracted pedestrians by employing appropriate braking behaviors. The high safety performance of the hybrid models can be attributed to the spontaneous slowing down of the vehicle that initiates before detecting pedestrians on UMCs. Although such a cautious driving pattern leads to extra delay, the time cost of the hybrid model is acceptable considering the significant improvements in ensuring pedestrian safety.}

The marginal effects of these contributing factors are calculated to explicitly quantify their impacts on road infrastructure damage. According to the analysis results, some strategies pertaining to safety education, traffic enforcement, roadway design, and intelligence transportation technology are advocated to reduce road infrastructure damage from expressway accidents.}

abstract = {There is a considerable body of literature that outlines the dangers of mobile phone use by drivers. However, there is very little research that explores the role and effectiveness of attempts to tackle this specific road user problem. Generally, normative motives are more likely to generate compliance with traffic law, and are more likely to be developed through approaches which focus on engagement and education. There would seem to be little potential for them to be developed through the use of penalty points and fines, which rely on more instrumental logic. Nonetheless, the decision was made in the UK in recent years to cease offering ‘courses’ (inputs to detected phone-using drivers offered as an alternative to prosecution) for mobile phone offences. This decision was made despite a lack of evidence one way or another about their effectiveness in tackling both handheld mobile phone use and handsfree mobile phone distraction – a form of distraction not explicitly covered in law. This research project aimed to explore driver education as an alternative to prosecution for mobile phone use while driving offences, focusing on perceptions and experiences of one particular educational intervention. This paper draws on 46 semi-structured interviews with those involved in delivering a specific intervention aimed at reducing handheld mobile phone use by drivers that was previously offered as an alternative to prosecution in the UK; the police officers identifying offenders for referral to such courses, those delivering the intervention, drivers attending the course as an alternative to prosecution and members of the public attending the course as general education. Four key themes, with underpinning subthemes, emerged; 1) Police officer discretion and control over entry into the criminal justice system 2) Police-public interactions, 3) Course experiences, and 4) Post-course considerations. Firstly, police officer discretion is an important determinant of criminal justice system outcome, based on subjective rather than legal decisions about whether or not to report drivers for an offence. Secondly, police officers negotiate encounters with road users using the avoidance of prosecution as a way of diffusing difficult conversations, sometimes by offering a course as a preferable alternative to prosecution, sometimes by encouraging handsfree phone use. Thirdly, course attendance provides an opportunity to develop both normative alignment through increased understanding of police work, and to appreciate a range of instrumental consequences associated with mobile phone use. Both self-reportedly impacted upon mobile phone use while driving. Finally, post-course considerations emphasised a focus on who should be offered courses as an alternative to prosecution, focusing upon desires for both punitive and rehabilitative responses to mobile phone using drivers.}

To that end, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) text mining method was applied to extract a comprehensive list of studies that were conducted during the past 21 years related to pedestrian violation behaviours. Using the extracted studies, a multi-sectional literature review was developed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the different aspects related to pedestrian violations. Afterward, a meta-analysis was undertaken, using the studies that reported quantitative results, in order to obtain the average impact of the different contributing factors on the frequency of pedestrian violations. The study found that pedestrian violations are one of the hazardous behaviours that contribute to both the frequency and severity of pedestrian-vehicle collisions. According to the literature, the waiting time at the curbside, traffic volume, walking speed, pedestrian distraction, the presence of bus stops and schools, and the presence of on-street parking are among the key factors that increase the likelihood of pedestrian violations. The study has also reviewed a wide range of strategies that can be used to mitigate violations and reduce the safety consequences of such behaviour, including simple engineering-based countermeasures, enforcement, solutions that rely on advanced in-vehicle technologies, and infrastructure connectivity features, educational programs, and public campaigns.}

abstract = {Autonomous vehicles are equipped with advanced vehicle technology (AVT) that will improve road traffic safety and reduce accidents. However, due to the uncertain behavior of other road users, collisions can never be completely eliminated. Collision reconfiguration systems offer a solution by, for instance, changing where vehicles are hit and how the impact force is directed towards them. Unfortunately, the logic behind the decision-making of collision reconfiguration systems is fundamentally different from that of other AVTs. Fundamentally different feedback might thus be required from accident analyses to ensure the successful design of collision reconfiguration systems. Through simulations, this study explores decision-making strategies of collision reconfiguration systems to ascertain the implications of which feedback is required from accident analyses. Results show that different strategies can be statistically significantly different from each other in the way they affect severity; and that a new source of unobserved heterogeneity could easily be small variations in the algorithms used by collision reconfiguration systems. Based on this, three new needs to consider during accident analysis are put forth: firstly, new safety surrogate measures (SSMs) that consider severity are required; one such SSM is proposed; secondly, to identify new unobserved heterogeneity as a result of collision reconfiguration systems, the trajectories of traffic near-collisions should be recorded, and statistical tools to identify comparable scenarios developed. Thirdly, new collision patterns will make it difficult to analyze the implications of reconfigured collisions, which suggests that collision configurations must be carefully recorded to provide early feedback.}

Respondents were confronted with hypothetical route choices that differ in respect of travel costs, travel time and crash risk. The survey was completed by 8,002 respondents, equally spread over the four participating countries and representative for each country with regards to gender, age and region. Possible biases caused by problematic choice behaviour such as inconsistent, irrational or lexicographic answers were addressed. The resulting values were estimated by means of a mixed logit model allowing to account for the panel nature of the data. The Value of a Statistical Life (VSL) was estimated at 6.2 Mill EUR, the Value of a Statistical Serious Injury (VSSI) at 950,000 EUR, and the Value of Time (VoT) at 16.1 EUR/h. Consequently, the relative value of avoiding a fatal injury is estimated to be around 7 times higher than the value of an avoided serious injury. The study revealed differences between countries with France showing values that are significantly lower than the average and Germany showing values that are significantly higher. The estimated VSL values are considerably higher than the values currently used in the four countries, but they are within the range of values found in similar stated choice studies. The results can be used as an input in a broad range of socioeconomic studies including cost-benefit analysis and assessments of socioeconomic costs of road crashes.}

In our 2 (scenario type: human driver vs. AV) × 2 (victim identity salience: low vs. high) between-subjects survey, we randomly allocated participants (N = 956) to one of four conditions where they viewed a video clip from an AV or a human driver showing a car suddenly braking continuously ahead of the AV or human driver’s car. The salience of victim identity influenced the observers’ appraisals of aggressive behavior. When asked to judge the front car’s behavior toward this AV or human driver (the victim identity is salient), they reported more acceptability and less risk perception, negative affect, and immoral judgment while judging this behavior toward the AV. When asked to judge the front car’s behavior (the victim identity not highlighted), they reported non-different appraisals. This finding implies that AVs might need to hide their identity to blend in visually and behaviorally as regular cars.}

Initially, 25 naturalistic clips were included and edited into a hazard prediction test following the “what happens next?” paradigm. The overall score of the test was higher for experienced drivers when compared with novices. On further inspection the overall group difference was driven by 12 clips. The Lithuanian Hazard Perception test HPT-LIT featuring static images (Tūskė et al., 2019) and Hazard Perception Questionnaire developed by White et al. (2011) were used to validate the new test. This new version of the test (12 clips, LHP12) showed acceptable psychometric properties. Drivers with less driving experience demonstrated poorer hazard prediction skills than experienced drivers. The results revealed a negative correlation between hazard prediction scores on LHP12 and crash involvement in the novice driver group, as well as a positive correlation between prediction scores and self-reported hazard prediction skills. It was concluded that the new Lithuanian hazard test shows potential for future research.}

One of the potential causal factors is pedestrian distraction. Therefore, this study aimed to predict pedestrian intention to cross the road under conditions of distraction (using phone maps, talking to another pedestrian, listening to music through headphones), by applying the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) using an online survey. This also involved investigation of the impact of selected traffic characteristics (traffic density, vehicle speed) and crossing type (pelican, zebra, unmarked). The survey consisted of 72 questions and took approximately 15 min to complete. The results (N = 81) revealed that the TPB construct of perceived behavioural control (PBC) was a significant predictor of intention to cross the road while distracted across all scenarios. Furthermore, crossing type was a significant predictor of PBC across all scenarios, with marked crossings facilitating feelings of PBC. Findings suggest that high feelings of PBC, as measured through ease and confidence, are linked with stronger intention to cross the road while distracted. This understanding of pedestrian motivation can be used to help design interventions (such as auditory and visual pedestrian warnings) that prevent conflict between distracted pedestrians and vehicles. These interventions should target marked crossing types, whereby pedestrians are more likely to cross while distracted.}

Analyzing these factors can be critical in improving traffic safety. Despite many crash models having been successfully developed for safety analytics, most models associate crash observations and contributing factors at the aggregate level, resulting in potential information loss. This study proposes an efficient Gaussian process modulated renewal process model for safety analytics that does not suffer from information loss due to data aggregations. The proposed model can infer crash intensities in the continuous-time dimension so that they can be better associated with contributing factors that change over time. Moreover, the model can infer non-homogeneous intensities by relaxing the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) exponential assumption of the crash intervals. To demonstrate the validity and advantages of this proposed model, an empirical study examining the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on traffic safety at six interstate highway sections is performed. The accuracy of our proposed renewal model is verified by comparing the areas under the curve (AUC) of the inferred crash intensity function with the actual crash counts. Residual box plot shows that our proposed models have lower biases and variances compared with Poisson and Negative binomial models. Counterfactual crash intensities are then predicted conditioned on exogenous variables at the crash time. Time-varying safety impacts such as bimodal, unimodal, and parabolic patterns are observed at the selected highways. The case study shows the proposed model enables safety analytics at a granular level and provides a more detailed insight into the time-varying safety risk in a changing environment.}

abstract = {Background
Diabetes is a major public health challenge, affecting millions of people worldwide. Abnormal physiology in diabetes, particularly hypoglycemia, can cause driver impairments that affect safe driving. While diabetes driver safety has been previously researched, few studies link real-time physiologic changes in drivers with diabetes to objective real-world driver safety, particularly at high-risk areas like intersections. To address this, we investigated the role of acute physiologic changes in drivers with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) on safe stopping at stop intersections.
Methods
18 T1DM drivers (21–52 years, μ = 31.2 years) and 14 controls (21–55 years, μ = 33.4 years) participated in a 4-week naturalistic driving study. At induction, each participant’s personal vehicle was instrumented with a camera and sensor system to collect driving data (e.g., GPS, video, speed). Video was processed with computer vision algorithms detecting traffic elements (e.g., traffic signals, stop signs). Stop intersections were geolocated with clustering methods, state intersection databases, and manual review. Videos showing driver stop intersection approaches were extracted and manually reviewed to classify stopping behavior (full, rolling, and no stop) and intersection traffic characteristics.
Results
Mixed-effects logistic regression models determined how diabetes driver stopping safety (safe vs. unsafe stop) was affected by 1) disease and 2) at-risk, acute physiology (hypo- and hyperglycemia). Diabetes drivers who were acutely hyperglycemic (≥ 300 mg/dL) had 2.37 increased odds of unsafe stopping (95% CI: 1.26–4.47, p = 0.008) compared to those with normal physiology. Acute hypoglycemia did not associate with unsafe stopping (p = 0.537), however the lower frequency of hypoglycemia (vs. hyperglycemia) warrants a larger sample of drivers to investigate this effect. Critically, presence of diabetes alone did not associate with unsafe stopping, underscoring the need to evaluate driver physiology in licensing guidelines.
Conclusion
This study links acute, abnormal physiologic fluctuations in drivers with diabetes to driver safety based on unsafe stopping at stop-controlled intersections, providing recommendations for clinicians aimed at improving patient safety, fair licensing guidelines, and targets for developing advanced driver assistance systems.}
