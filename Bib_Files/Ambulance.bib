abstract = {Advanced Automatic Crash Notification (AACN) systems, capable of predicting post-crash injury severity and subsequent automatic transfer of injury assessment data to emergency medical services, may significantly improve the timeliness, appropriateness, and efficacy of care provided. The estimation of injury severity based on statistical field data, as incorporated in current AACN systems, lack specificity and accuracy to identify the risk of life-threatening conditions. To enhance the existing AACN framework, the goal of the current study was to develop a computational methodology to predict risk of injury in specific body regions based on specific characteristics of the crash, occupant and vehicle. The computational technique involved multibody models of the vehicle and the occupant to simulate the case-specific occupant dynamics and subsequently predict the injury risk using established physical metrics. To demonstrate the computational-based injury prediction methodology, three frontal crash cases involving adult drivers in passenger cars were extracted from the US National Automotive Sampling System Crashworthiness Data System. The representative vehicle model, anthropometrically scaled model of the occupant and kinematic information related to the crash cases, selected at different severities, were used for the blinded verification of injury risk estimations in five different body regions. When compared to existing statistical algorithms, the current computational methodology is a significant improvement toward post-crash injury prediction specifically tailored to individual attributes of the crash. Variations in the initial posture of the driver, analyzed as a pre-crash variable, were shown to have a significant effect on the injury risk.}

abstract = {Rapid motor vehicle crash detection and characterization is possible through the use of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and sensors are an integral part of any ITS system. The major focus of this paper is on developing optimal placement of accident detecting omnidirectional sensors to maximize incident detection capabilities and provide ample opportunities for data fusion and crash characterization. Both omnidirectional sensors (placed in suitable infrastructure locations) and mobile sensors are part of our analysis. The surrogates used are acoustic sensors (omnidirectional) and Advanced Automated Crash Notification (AACN) sensors (mobile). This data fusion rich placement is achieved through a hybrid optimization model comprising of an explicit–implicit coverage model followed by an evaluation and local search optimization using simulation. The compound explicit–implicit model delivers good initial solutions and improves the detection and data fusion capabilities compared to the explicit model alone. The results of the studies conducted quantify the use of a data fusion capable environment in crash detection scenarios, and the simulation tool developed helps a decision maker evaluate sensor placement strategy.}

abstract = {Driving volatility captures the extent of speed variations when a vehicle is being driven. Extreme longitudinal variations signify hard acceleration or braking. Warnings and alerts given to drivers can reduce such volatility potentially improving safety, energy use, and emissions. This study develops a fundamental understanding of instantaneous driving decisions, needed for hazard anticipation and notification systems, and distinguishes normal from anomalous driving. In this study, driving task is divided into distinct yet unobserved regimes. The research issue is to characterize and quantify these regimes in typical driving cycles and the associated volatility of each regime, explore when the regimes change and the key correlates associated with each regime. Using Basic Safety Message (BSM) data from the Safety Pilot Model Deployment in Ann Arbor, Michigan, two- and three-regime Dynamic Markov switching models are estimated for several trips undertaken on various roadway types. While thousands of instrumented vehicles with vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communication systems are being tested, nearly 1.4 million records of BSMs, from 184 trips undertaken by 71 instrumented vehicles are analyzed in this study. Then even more detailed analysis of 43 randomly chosen trips (N=714,340 BSM records) that were undertaken on various roadway types is conducted. The results indicate that acceleration and deceleration are two distinct regimes, and as compared to acceleration, drivers decelerate at higher rates, and braking is significantly more volatile than acceleration. Different correlations of the two regimes with instantaneous driving contexts are explored. With a more generic three-regime model specification, the results reveal high-rate acceleration, high-rate deceleration, and cruise/constant as the three distinct regimes that characterize a typical driving cycle. Moreover, given in a high-rate regime, drivers’ on-average tend to decelerate at a higher rate than their rate of acceleration. Importantly, compared to cruise/constant regime, drivers’ instantaneous driving decisions are more volatile both in “high-rate” acceleration as well as “high-rate” deceleration regime. The study contributes to analyzing volatility in short-term driving decisions, and how changes in driving regimes can be mapped to a combination of local traffic states surrounding the vehicle.}

abstract = {Traditional emergency management studies have made resource allocation decisions to serve the current emergency without knowing which future emergency will be occurring. Different ordered combinations of emergencies result in different performance outcomes. Even though future events can be anticipated, previous studies follow an assumption that events over a time interval are independent. This study follows an assumption that events are interdependent, because speed reduction and rubbernecking due to an initial incident provoke secondary incidents on freeways and the resource availability depends on service times of each request. The misconception that secondary incidents are not common has resulted in overlooking a look-ahead concept. This study is the pioneer in relaxing the structural assumptions of independency during the assignment of servers and approaching the challenge from an operational perspective, online optimization. The main objective is to minimize the time needed to respond to a sequence of requests. We introduce online dispatching strategies with visualization applied in different network sizes, number of requests, and service times to provide insights on model behavior and solution quality. The experimental evidence indicates that the algorithm works well in practice. We envision a new era in which an optimal resource allocation adapts to external events effectively and anticipates the future learning from the past to produce effective solutions.}

abstract = {Travel time is very critical for emergency response and emergency vehicle (EV) operations. Compared to ordinary vehicles (OVs), EVs are permitted to break conventional road rules to reach the destination within shorter time. However, very few previous studies address the travel time performance of EVs. This study obtained nearly 4-year EV travel time data in Northern Virginia (NOVA) region using 76,000 preemption records at signalized intersections. First, the special characteristics of EV travel time are explored in mean, median, standard deviation and also the distribution, which display largely different characteristics from that of OVs in previous studies. Second, a utility-based model is proposed to quantify the travel time performance of EVs. Third, this paper further investigates two important components of the utility model: benchmark travel time and standardized travel time. The mode of the distribution is chosen as benchmark travel time, and its nonlinear decreasing relationship with the link length is revealed. At the same time, the distribution of standardized travel time is fitted with different candidate distributions and Inv. Gaussian distribution is proved to be the most suitable one. Finally, to validate the proposed model, we implement the model in case studies to estimate link and route travel time performance. The results of route comparisons also show that the proposed model can support EV route choice and eventually improve EV service and operations.}
