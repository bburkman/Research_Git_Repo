abstract = {Minimizing passenger transfer times through public transport (PT) transfer synchronization is important during tactical planning and real-time control. However, there are computational challenges for solving this Timetable Synchronization Problem (TSP) for large, real-world urban PT networks. Hence, in this study we propose a data-driven, passenger-oriented methodology as a preparatory selection stage to reduce problem dimensionality by (1) determining the significant transfer hubs in the network, and (2) identifying subsets of lines within these hubs that need to be prioritized for transfer synchronization. In the first phase of our methodology we determine the spatial boundaries of transfer locations, using a clustering technique based on the passenger transfer flow matrix inferred from smartcard data. After that, a subset of hubs to be prioritized for synchronization is selected. In the second phase, we characterize the transfer patterns within the hubs based on a topological representation. Based on these topological graphs, the line bundles that need to be prioritized within the hubs are further identified using a modularity-based community detection technique. We apply our methodology to a real-world case study, i.e. the PT network of The Hague, the Netherlands. For this case study, our approach allows for prioritizing 70\% of all transfers within identified transfer locations while only requiring 0.9\% of these transfer locations, thus reducing the complexity of solving the TSP substantially at a relatively low cost. Our method supports public transport operators during timetable design and real-time control in determining where and which lines to prioritize when devising measures for improving transfer experience and synchronization.}

Uncertainties in the airborne phase have significantly less impact on flight punctuality than deviations in aircraft ground operations. The ground trajectory of an aircraft primarily consists of the handling processes at the stand, defined as the aircraft turnaround, which are mainly controlled by operational experts. Only the aircraft boarding, which is on the critical path of the turnaround, is driven by the passengers’ experience and willingness or ability to follow the proposed procedures. We used a recurrent neural network approach to predict the progress of a running boarding event. In particular, we implemented and trained the Long Short-Term Memory model. Since no operational data of the specific passenger behavior is available, we used a reliable, validated boarding simulation environment to provide data about the aircraft boarding events. First predictions show that uni-variate input (seat load progress) produces insufficient results, so we consider expected passenger interactions in the aircraft cabin as well. These interactions are aggregated to a prior-developed complexity metric and allow an efficient evaluation of the current boarding progress. With this multi-variate input, our Long Short-Term Memory model achieves appropriate prediction results for the boarding progress.}

abstract = {Activity-based modelling is a modern agent-based approach to travel demand modelling, in which the transport demand is derived from the agent’s needs to perform certain activities at specific places and times. The agent’s mobility is considered in a broader context, which allows the activity-based models to produce more realistic trip chains, compared to traditional trip-based models. The core of any activity-based model is an activity scheduler – a software component producing sequences of agent’s daily activities interconnected by trips, called activity schedules. Traditionally, activity schedulers used to rely heavily on hard-coded knowledge of transport behaviour experts. We introduce the concept of a Data-Driven Activity Scheduler (DDAS), which replaces numerous expert-designed components and their intricately engineered interactions with a collection of machine learning models. Its architecture is significantly simpler, making it easier to deploy and maintain. This shift towards data-driven, machine learning based approach is possible due to increased availability of mobility-related data. We demonstrate DDAS concept using our own proof-of-concept implementation, perform a rigorous analysis and compare the validity of the resulting model to one of the rule-based alternatives using the Validation Framework for Activity-Based Models (VALFRAM).}

This paper addresses the problems of terminal airspace management and airport congestion management at the macroscopic level through the integrated control of arrivals and departures. Conflict detection and resolution methods are applied to a predefined terminal route structure. Different airside components are modeled using network abstraction. Speed, arrival and departure times, and runway assignment are managed by using an optimization method. An adapted simulated annealing heuristic combined with a time decomposition approach is proposed to solve the corresponding problem. Computational experiments performed on case studies of Paris Charles De-Gaulle airport show some potential improvements: First, when the airport capacity is decreased, until a certain threshold, the overload can be mitigated properly by adjusting the aircraft entry time in the Terminal Maneuvering Area and the pushback time. Second, landing and take-off runway assignments in peak hours with imbalanced runway throughputs can significantly reduce flight delays. A decrease of 37\% arrival delays and 36\% departure delays was reached compared to baseline case.}

abstract = {Existing map-Matching (MM) algorithms primarily localize positioning fixes along the centerline of a road and have largely ignored road width as an input. Consequently, vehicle lane-level localization, which is essential for stringent Intelligent Transport System (ITS) applications, seems difficult to accomplish, especially with the positioning data from low-cost GPS sensors. This paper aims to address this limitation by developing a new dynamic two-dimensional (D2D) weight-based MM algorithm incorporating dynamic weight coefficients and road width. To enable vehicle lane-level localization, a road segment is virtually expressed as a matrix of homogeneous grids with reference to a road centerline. These grids are then used to map-match positioning fixes as opposed to matching on a road centerline as carried out in traditional MM algorithms. In this developed algorithm, vehicle location identification on a road segment is based on the total weight score which is a function of four different weights: (i) proximity, (ii) kinematic, (iii) turn-intent prediction, and (iv) connectivity. Different parameters representing network complexity and positioning quality are used to assign the relative importance to different weight scores by employing an adaptive regression method. To demonstrate the transferability of the developed algorithm, it was tested by using 5,830 GPS positioning points collected in Nottingham, UK and 7,414 GPS positioning points collected in Mumbai and Pune, India. The developed algorithm, using stand-alone GPS position fixes, identifies the correct links 96.1\% (for the Nottingham data) and 98.4\% (for the Mumbai-Pune data) of the time. In terms of the correct lane identification, the algorithm was found to provide the accurate matching for 84\% (Nottingham) and 79\% (Mumbai-Pune) of the fixes obtained by stand-alone GPS. Using the same methodology adopted in this study, the accuracy of the lane identification could further be enhanced if the localization data from additional sensors (e.g. gyroscope) are utilized. ITS industry and vehicle manufacturers can implement this D2D map-matching algorithm for liability critical and in-vehicle information systems and services such as advanced driver assistant systems (ADAS).}

In doing so, we care about not only the model configuration but also the representation of data (i.e., matrix, third-order tensor and fourth-order tensor). Using a nine-week spatiotemporal traffic speed data set (road segment × day × time of day) collected in Guangzhou, China, we evaluate the performance of this fully Bayesian model and explore how different data representations affect imputation performance through extensive experiments. The results show the proposed model can produce accurate imputations even under temporally correlated data corruption. Our experiments also show that data representation is a crucial factor for model performance, and a third-order tensor structure outperforms the matrix and fourth-order tensor representations in preserving information in our data set. We hope this work could give insights to practitioners when performing spatiotemporal data imputation tasks.}

Observations of cyclists in following interactions are clustered into constrained and unconstrained states. Observations of overtaking cyclists are clustered into initiation, merging and post-overtaking states. Multivariate distributions within each cluster are examined, along with state transitions for each type of interaction.

abstract = {Reservations in daily services can improve user satisfaction, and give additional information about the demand patterns to the operators. However, providing reservations to carsharing clients is difficult. While carsharing is especially convenient if it is allowing one-way trips and vehicle drop-off anywhere in the service area (called free-floating), this flexibility increases management complexity because of vehicle stock imbalance. Most of the commercial providers of free-floating carsharing offer reservations under highly restrictive terms, for example only up to 30 min in advance. In this paper, we propose an innovative reservation enforcement technique that allows substantially longer reservation times while keeping the system profitable and achieving high service quality. A simple way to enforce reservations is locking vehicles until the departure time of a client. However, it comes at the cost of idling vehicles that could be used by other users and decreasing the revenue. Our approach, called relocations-based reservation enforcement method (R-BR) combines vehicle locking and relocation movements. It locks vehicles only a short time before the trip departure if a suitable vehicle is close enough due to the natural trip patterns. If no such vehicle is available, a car is relocated from another place. Further, we propose a variable quality of service (QoS) model in which the guaranteed radius around the user within which the reserved vehicle will be placed, and the maximum allowed reservation time before the departure depends on the zone of trip departure. A simulation-based optimization is used whereby the carsharing operation is simulated and optimized using an iterated local search (ILS) metaheuristic for adjustment of service level parameters. The proposed technique is tested on a set of artificial problem examples and a case study of a simulated working day in the Lisbon Municipality, Portugal. Results show that the proposed R-BR method is substantially better than the simple vehicle locking when the constant QoS approach is used and that the devised ILS metaheuristic can further increase the system performance, especially with high trip volumes.}

A theoretical acceptance model was proposed by extending the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with new constructs: initial trust and two types of perceived risk (i.e., perceived safety risk [PSR] and perceived privacy risk [PPR]). It was hypothesized that initial trust was built upon perception factors (i.e., perceived usefulness [PU], perceived ease of use [PEOU], PSR, and PPR) and was a key determinant of AV acceptance. The validity of the model was confirmed with a structure equation modeling analysis based on data collected from 216 survey samples. Results revealed that initial trust was the most critical factor in promoting a positive attitude towards AVs, which, together with PU, determined users’ intention to use AVs. Initial trust could be enhanced by improving PU and reducing PSR associated with AVs. Theoretically, these findings suggest that initial trust offers another and probably more important pathway for other factors to impact consumers’ adoption of systems with uncertainty. Practically, the findings provide guidance for designing interventions aimed at improving public’s acceptance towards AVs.}

Arrival Manager tools aim to improve arrival flows at airports. To do so they need reliable, accurate assessments of potential congestion and delay issues. This paper sets out a methodology for predicting and evaluating the operational state of the airport arrival system. This methodology is structured in two steps: the prediction stage and the reliability stage. The prediction model is based on a Bayesian Network approach, which reflects the stochastic and time-varying nature of airport operations. It also provides insights into the interdependencies between factors contributing to airport performance. The reliability model uses a Multi-State System structure, as the airport arrival system has a large number of performance levels. It is developed via a Markov process technique. By combining these prediction and reliability models we can assess the characteristics of the airport arrival system: stationary state, availability, performance and degradation. The methodology is applied to a case study at a busy European airport, using real data from peak traffic months. Results for the scenarios analyzed show that the factors that have a greatest impact on delay and congestion are the level of saturation at arrival processes, the time frame of the day (which determines the arrival declared capacity) and the meteorological conditions. Moreover, arrival states of congestion reduce the airport’s ability to maintain optimal performance rates. The model represents an evolution from the traditional corrective and binary vision of performance analysis towards a predictive and multi-state approach. The results can be applied to derive operational strategies and draw conclusions regarding arrival performance and management.}

abstract = {In modern urban transit networks, buses and subways are not distinguished as different modes of transportation; this makes it challenging to analyze travel behaviors with multiple modes for the purpose of developing policies and plans. With the introduction of Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) systems, these modes are operated along a complex of links and nodes that constitute a multimodal transit network. Methods for analyzing travel behaviors in mass transit have been developed, but previous approaches fail to adequately reflect travel behaviors and network features (e.g., transfers, mode and route preferences). To overcome such limitations, this research proposes a smart card data-based analytical method with which travel behaviors can be efficiently and accurately examined. AFC systems provide a tremendous amount of data that contain detailed trip information, and using these data reinforces the reliability of the proposed data-driven method. The proposed method of analysis involves four core processes: establishing a scheme for how multiple transit modes can be integrated into one multimodal transit network on the basis of information derived from the AFC system, selecting feasible paths, assigning trips using a stochastic approach, and verifying analytical results by comparing them with findings from trip datasets. This method was used to analyze monthly smart card data collected from the AFC system in 2009 in the greater Seoul area. Multimodal transit networks were constructed from 34,852 bus stops and 539 subway stations using smart card data, and in total, 3,614,875 trips were used in the analysis. The final model for stochastic transit assignment was developed using the proposed method, which was verified by comparing actual and assigned trips. The proposed method exhibits high accuracy (83.93\%) and a high R-square value (0.981), which supports the strength of the proposed stochastic transit assignment model. The findings reveal new interesting research directions for exploration, such as developing more disaggregated models (e.g., for specific regions, times, and users), considering detailed transfer features (e.g., transferable boundaries, transfer facilities, and transfer times), confirming the method’s applicability by testing it in other cities, and incorporating both multimodal transit and road networks into the proposed model.}

One significant step is to support the integration and enrichment of a broad variety of data, often using state of the art linked data approaches. Among the many advantages of such enrichment is that this may enable the use of intelligent processes to autonomously manage urban facilities such as traffic signal controls. In this paper we document an attempt to integrate sets of sensor and historical data using a data hub and a set of ontologies for the data. We argue that access to such high level integrated data sources leads to the enhancement of the capabilities of an urban transport operator. We demonstrate this by documenting the development of a planning agent which uses such data as inputs in the form of logic statements, and when given traffic goals to achieve, outputs complex traffic signal strategies which help transport operators deal with exceptional events such as road closures or road traffic saturation. The aim is to create an autonomous agent which reacts to commands from transport operators in the face of exceptional events involving saturated roads, and creates, executes and monitors plans to deal with the effects of such events. We evaluate the intelligent agent in a region of a large urban area, under the direction of urban transport operators.}

The former is defined as the percentage of public areas with charging stations installed and the latter represents the drivers probability of accessing a public charger at their trip stops (stop-based) or during at least one stop of their travel day (trip chain-based). Understanding this relationship is important to PEV manufacturers and electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) providers, as well as government agencies, for evaluating different levels of EVSE deployment and estimating the impact of its availability on PEV adoption. Heuristic procedures are developed to estimate stop- and trip chain-based charging opportunities. Charging opportunity reflects the visibility of EVSE as the incremental security that charging stations enable, while evaluating the potential of a driver to access EVSE at travel stops or during the day, for different levels of EVSE deployment on the transportation network. The metrics proposed do not assess the probability of completing trips with electric vehicles of a given range. The analysis results indicate that drivers’ trip destinations concentrate in a few popular places and EVSE deployment in these areas could achieve relatively high levels of charging opportunity. This finding is also robust to regional variations.}

From a traffic perspective, although some congestion reduction may be achieved (thanks to fewer crashes and tighter headways), car-trip frequencies and vehicle miles traveled (VMT) are likely to rise significantly, reducing the benefits of driverless vehicles. Congestion pricing (CP) and road tolls are key tools for moderating demand and incentivizing more socially and environmentally optimal travel choices. This work develops multiple CP and tolling strategies in alternative future scenarios, and investigates their effects on the Austin, Texas network conditions and traveler welfare, using the agent-based simulation model MATSim. Results suggest that, while all pricing strategies reduce congestion, their social welfare impacts differ in meaningful ways. More complex and advanced strategies perform better in terms of traffic conditions and traveler welfare, depending on the development of the mobility landscape of autonomous driving. The possibility to refund users by reinvesting toll revenues as traveler budgets plays a salient role in the overall efficiency of each CP strategy as well as in the public acceptability.}

Hence, they scale linearly with the number of links in the network and independently of other network attributes, such as the dimension of the route choice set or the link lengths. The temporal correlation, of the link performance metrics across time intervals, is approximately captured through the parameters of the metamodel. Since the T analytical optimization problems are decoupled and can be solved independently, the proposed approach scales independently of the number of calibration time intervals, making it suitable for the calibration of demand over numerous time periods. The approach is efficient and scalable. It is suitable to address high-dimensional calibration problems for large-scale network models. It is benchmarked on both a toy network and a Singapore network versus two general-purpose algorithms: SPSA and a derivative-free pattern search algorithm. The validation experiments indicate that the proposed method identifies points with objective function estimates that outperform the benchmark methods by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude. As the problem dimension and the temporal correlation, across time intervals, increase, so does the magnitude by which the proposed method outperforms the benchmark methods. The Singapore case study considers a problem of dimension 16,200. This is 2 orders of magnitude higher than what is currently considered high-dimensional for continuous SO problems. The proposed method identifies solutions with an estimated objective function that is 1 order of magnitude better than those of the benchmark methods. It yields solutions that provide an average, across time intervals, improvement to link counts of 77\%, compared to the benchmark methods. The case study also illustrates the robustness of the method to the quality of the initial points.}

abstract = {This paper develops an optimization model for planning an artificial island composed of Very Large Floating Structures (VLFSs). The optimization model addresses the geometric shape of the island (the array of floating platforms), the land-use layout, and the transportation network. The model developed in this paper considers the specific properties related to an artificial island made of multiple floating modules. The model is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem. In the upper level problem, the decision-maker is required to decide the land-use layout and the road network structure. The user behavior pattern is obtained by solving the lower level problem, which is dependent on the decisions taken at the upper level. Given the complexity of the problem, the paper develops modifications to the genetic algorithm to find the Pareto front in a reasonable amount of time. A test case illustrates the feasibility of the proposed planning method. The transportation model execution is the most time-consuming task, which highlights the need to prune irrelevant scenarios. The Pareto front shows a substitution pattern between different land-use configurations, in accordance with the different objective functions.}

Vehicular trajectory control and intersection controller optimization based on CAV technologies are two approaches that have significant potential to mitigate congestion, lessen the risk of crashes, reduce fuel consumption, and decrease emissions at intersections. These two approaches should be integrated into a single process such that both aspects can be optimized simultaneously to achieve maximum benefits. This paper proposes an efficient DP-SH (dynamic programming with shooting heuristic as a subroutine) algorithm for the integrated optimization problem that can simultaneously optimize the trajectories of CAVs and intersection controllers (i.e., signal timing and phasing of traffic signals), and develops a two-step approach (DP-SH and trajectory optimization) to effectively obtain near-optimal intersection and trajectory control plans. Also, the proposed DP-SH algorithm can also consider mixed traffic stream scenarios with different levels of CAV market penetration. Numerical experiments are conducted, and the results prove the efficiency and sound performance of the proposed optimization framework. The proposed DP-SH algorithm, compared to the adaptive signal control, can reduce the average travel time by up to 35.72\% and save the consumption by up to 31.5\%. In mixed traffic scenarios, system performance improves with increasing market penetration rates. Even with low levels of penetration, there are significant benefits in fuel consumption savings. The computational efficiency, as evidenced in the case studies, indicates the applicability of DP-SH for real-time implementation.}

abstract = {The importance of calibration of microscopic traffic models as the main core of traffic simulation software results from the need for more realistic traffic behaviors. The latent essence of several parameters in such models as well as the uncertainties resulting from the noise in the data, make the process of calibration much more complex. Usually, the calibration process is formulated as an optimization problem. Selecting the appropriate solution algorithm due to nonlinear and non-convex nature of the problem is crucial. The importance of the issue is more significant when the matter of calibrating the medium or large-scale simulation model is considered. This is mainly due to the expensive cost that running the simulation models impose. Therefore, applying the current algorithms in which finding the appropriate solutions requires a large number of simulation runs is not deemed suitable. In this paper, an estimation of distribution algorithm based on copula theory has been suggested. In contrast with traditional solution algorithms, in the proposed algorithm complex interaction between parameters of a model has been considered by constructing and sampling from a copula-based probabilistic model. Copulas are functions that describe the dependence structure of a set of random variables and connect multivariate distribution functions to one-dimensional marginal distribution functions. The results indicate that applying an explicit probabilistic model based on copula helps the estimation of distribution algorithm to explore the search space more effectively and efficiently as well as provides the possibility of extracting the knowledge with regard to the structure of the calibration problem through analyzing the probabilistic models that are constructed during the evolution process. Furthermore, this new algorithm has been compared with the genetic algorithm and kernel-based cross-entropy method on synthetic and real trajectory data. The results confirm that the proposed algorithm is more efficient in terms of convergence rate, resource usage and more robust in terms of the probability of finding the global optimal solution.}

abstract = {Taxi service is an essential complement to public transport systems due to its convenience and availability. It often provides hundreds of millions of rides for urban travelers every year in cities across the world. At the same time, the number of trip-induced passenger complaints about trip anomalies (trips with anomalous trip length, time, fare, etc.) is also considerable. Hence, the taxi regulators impose harsh penalties on verified trip anomalies. The existing anomaly verification process is labor-intensive, and it does not consider the traffic variability as well as the passengers’ perception of trip anomalies. Quite often the imprecise and unfair outputs are generated as a result. To tackle this issue, we propose a choice probability-based taxi trip anomaly detection model (ProbDetect) that considers the taxi drivers’ route choice behavior as well as the traffic variability. We first generate a route choice set for each OD pair based on the massive taxi GPS trajectory data. Second, we assign each route with a choice probability derived from a cumulative multivariate probability over differences of generalized costs. Third, we distinguish the unintentional anomalies from the intentional anomalies using the expected and the realized choice probability. Lastly, the model is tested on 5000 OD pairs using 180 days of taxi GPS data in Shanghai, China. Three types of anomalies are detected as a result. Insights into the driver’s route choice behavior are derived as well.}

Next, we apply our trained ANN to classify the respondents from a recent Value-of-Time Stated Choice experiment in terms of their most likely employed decision rule. We cross-validate our findings by comparing our results with those from: (1) single class discrete choice models estimated on subsets of the data, and (2) latent class discrete choice models. The cross-validations provide strong support for the notion that ANNs can be used to identify underlying decision rules in choice data.

An RL-based controller is developed by representing traffic states as graph-structured data and customizing corresponding neural network architectures to handle those data. The customizations enable the controller to: (i) model neighborhood-wide traffic based on directed-graph representations; (ii) use the representations to identify patterns in real-time traffic measurements; and (iii) capture those patterns to a spatial representation needed for selecting optimal cordon-metering rates. Input to the selection process also includes a total inflow to be admitted through a cordon. The rate is optimized in a separate process that is not part of the present work. Our RL-controller distributes that separately-optimized rate across the signalized street links that feed traffic through the cordon. The resulting metering rates vary from one feeder link to the next. The selection process can reoccur at short time intervals in response to changing traffic patterns. Once trained on a few cordons, the RL-controller can be deployed on cordons elsewhere in a city without additional training. This portability feature is confirmed via simulations of traffic on an idealized street network. The tests also indicate that the controller can reduce the network’s vehicle hours traveled well beyond what can be achieved via spatially-uniform cordon metering. The extra reductions in VHT are found to grow larger when traffic exhibits greater in-homogeneities over the network.}

The bus allocation problem for existing and short-turning/interlining lines is modeled as a combinatorial, constrained and multi-objective optimization problem that has an exponential computational complexity and a large set of decision variables due to the additional set of short-turning/interlining options. This constrained optimization problem is approximated with an unconstrained one with the use of exterior point penalties and is solved with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) meta-heuristic. The modeling approach is applied to the bus network of The Hague with the use of General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data and Automated Fare Collection (AFC) data from 24 weekdays. Sensitivity analysis results demonstrate a significant reduction potential in passenger waiting time and operational costs with the addition of only a few short-turning and interlining options.}

It further provides a first attempt to allow agents to make mode-choice decisions based on a discrete choice model that includes carsharing alternatives on a whole plan level. Relocation capabilities are added to the carsharing module that allow for testing of various relocation algorithms. The paper investigates the competition of carsharing operators on two levels. First, by investigating the impact of different price levels, and second, by allowing one or both of the competitors to perform relocations. The obtained results show that (1) with fixed market rate, operators can obtain the highest profit by offering the service at 0.41 CHF/min, (2) offering different pricing schemes can lead to a higher cumulative payoff, although one of the competitors is left with a reduced profit and (3) performing relocations is unprofitable for the company tasked with the burden of doing it, whilst a competitor may enjoy a free-rider effect with an increasing number of rentals and higher profit.}

The objective balances the operational priorities of minimizing tram running time and maximizing timetable adherence. The scheduled trajectories depict tram movements along the roads and dwell processes at stations. Arterial signal timings are resynchronized to favor tram movements. The proposed methodology was evaluated in a simulation of a real-world tram line. Compared with a traditional approach, the proposed methodology reduced tram running time, number of stops at intersections and schedule delay by 11.1\%, 82.4\% and 37.5\%, respectively.

Toward the closure of daily service, certain destinations will become inaccessible for last trains as the connecting service may have already been closed when passengers arrive at the transfer station. This study focuses on timetable synchronization of last trains to improve the network accessibility. A mixed integer programming model is first proposed to determine the scheduled time of last trains. The objective of the model is to maximize the weighted sum of accessible origin-destination (OD) pairs for last train services on the network, which indicates the percentage of passengers using last trains at origins who can reach their destinations successfully. A simple network is used to highlight the difference of the proposed model from existing transfer models in the literature. To solve for large networks, a genetic algorithm combining with a timetable-based Dijkstra's algorithm is developed. A real-life metro network is applied to evaluate the proposed model and solution methodology in practice. The results indicate the proposed model and algorithm enhances the network accessibility, as well as the transfer connections. Comparison analysis shows that the proposed model significantly outperforms the transfer model in network accessibility optimization.}

abstract = {Given a set of demand and potential facility locations and a set of fully available charged drones, an agency seeks to locate a pre-specified number of capacitated facilities and assign drones to the located facilities to serve the demands. The facilities serve as drone launching sites for distributing the resources. Each drone makes several one-to-one trips from the facility location to the demand points and back until the battery range is met. The planning period is short-term and therefore the recharging of drone batteries is not considered. This paper presents an integer linear programming formulation with the objective of maximizing coverage while explicitly incorporating the drone energy consumption and range constraints. The new formulation is called the Maximum Coverage Facility Location Problem with Drones or simply MCFLPD. The MCFLPD is a complex problem and even for relatively small problem sizes a state of the art MIP solver may require unacceptably long running times to find feasible solutions. Computational efficiency of MCFLPD solutions is a key factor since conditions associated with customer demands or weather conditions (e.g., wind direction and speed) may change suddenly and require a fast global reoptimization. To better balance solution quality and running times novel greedy and three-stage heuristics (3SH) are developed. The 3SH is based on decomposition and local exchange principles and involves a facility location and allocation problem, multiple knapsack subproblems, and a final local random search stage. On average the 3SH solutions are within 5\% of the best Gurobi solutions but at a small fraction of the running time. Multiple scenarios are run to highlight the importance of changes in drone battery capabilities on coverage.}

The isolated experimental environment provides a safe, economic, and controlled environment to study free flow traffic and phantom traffic waves. This article introduces a novel method that automates the data collection process in such an environment. Specifically, the vehicle trajectories are measured using a 360-degree camera, and the fuel rates are recorded via on-board diagnostics (OBD-II) scanners. The video data from the 360-degree camera is then processed by an offline unsupervised computer vision algorithm. To validate the data collection method, the technique is then evaluated on a series of eight experiments. Analysis shows that the collected data are highly accurate, with a mean positional bias of less than 0.002 m and a small standard deviation of 0.11 m. The positional data also yields reliable velocity estimates: the derived velocities are biased by only 0.02 m/s with a small standard deviation of 0.09 m/s. The produced trajectory and fuel rate data can be readily used to study human driving behaviors, to calibrate microsimulation models, to develop fuel consumption models, and to investigate engine emissions. To facilitate future research, the source code and the data are made publicly available online.}

abstract = {To address the air pollution problems and reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) have been developed to achieve higher fuel efficiency. The Energy Management System (EMS) is a very important component of a PHEV in achieving better fuel economy and it is a very active research area. So far, most of the existing EMS strategies are either just simply following predefined rules that are not adaptive to changing driving conditions; or heavily relying on accurate prediction of future traffic conditions. Deep learning algorithms have been successfully applied to many complex problems and proved to even outperform human beings in some tasks (e.g., play chess) in recent years, which shows the great potential of such methods in practical engineering problems. In this study, a deep reinforcement learning (Deep Q-network or DQN) based PHEV energy management system is designed to autonomously learn the optimal fuel/electricity splits from interactions between the vehicle and the traffic environment. It is a fully data-driven and self-learning model that does not rely on any prediction, predefined rules or even prior human knowledge. The experiment results show that the proposed model is capable of achieving 16.3\% energy savings (with the designed PHEV simulation model) on a typical commute trip, compared to conventional binary control strategies. In addition, a dueling Deep Q-network with dueling structure (DDQN) is also implemented and compared with single DQN in particular with respect to the convergence rate in the training process.}

At the same time, the industry is affected by various issues, inefficiencies, and externalities, particularly in the last-mile segment. As such, there is an emerging awareness of a need to improve urban mobility and transportation, making them more sustainable and competitive by mixing traditional and emerging technologies, such as cargo bikes, autonomous vehicles, and drones. In contrast, the complexity of the overall system, characterized by multiple actors with conflicting goals, requires a strategy that harmonizes these actors’ business and operational models. This study contributes in this direction along three axes. First, it defines the main actors involved in urban parcel delivery, and then analyzes their business models and the interactions between them. Second, it investigates the integration of traditional and green logistics (mainly cycle-logistics), from both business and operational perspectives, in order to identify synergies, conflicts, and the operational and economic consequences of adopting green vehicles. Third, it introduces a simulation-optimization decision support system tool capable of assessing mixed-fleet policies for the management of parcel delivery in urban areas. Finally, the decision support system is tested using real data of the city of Turin.}

Thus, it is important to model mode choice in evacuation for a better estimation of evacuation transit demand. In this study, a joint mode and destination type choice model was estimated based on multiple post-storm behavioral surveys from the northeastern seaboard to the Gulf coast. A Nested Logit model specification was used to estimate this joint choice model. The estimated model showed a significant linkage between mode and destination type choice, which validated the choice of a nested structure for the model. Selected variables include both household and zonal characteristics, reflecting the attributes of alternatives (e.g., hotel price and occupancy), the characteristics of households (e.g., residential stability and community density), and the interactions between them (e.g., average accessibility to a destination type). The use of multiple-storm data allowed the use of some variables that have not been considered in the past because of few variations in their values in a single dataset.

One of the key constraints in applying machine learning techniques for classification is the availability of sufficient data (traffic patterns) with clear and undisputed labels, e.g. traffic pattern X or Y. The challenge is that labelling traffic patterns (e.g. combinations of congested and freely flow areas over time and space) is highly subjective. In our view this means that assessment of how well algorithms label the data should also include a qualitative component that focuses on what the found patterns really mean for traffic flow operations and applications. In this study, we investigate the application of clustering analysis to obtain labels automatically from the data, where we indeed first qualitatively assess how meaningful the found labels are, and subsequently test quantitatively how well the labels separate the resulting feature space. By transforming traffic measurements (speeds) into (colored) images, two different approaches are proposed to extract the features of a large number of traffic patterns for clustering: point-based and area-based. The point-based approach is widely applied in the image processing literature, and explores local interest points in images (i.e. where large changes occur in color intensity); whereas a new area-based approach combines domain knowledge with Watershed segmentation to partition the images into different spatial-temporal segments from which domain specific features, such as wide moving jam patterns, are extracted. The results show that the Watershed segmentation separates the traffic (congestion) patterns into more meaningful and separable classes, comparable to those that have been proposed in the literature. Since there is no ground-truth set of labels, the quantitative assessment tests how well both methods are able to separate the respective feature spaces they construct for the (large) database of traffic patterns. We argue that the more crisp this separation is; the better the labelling has turned out. For this quantitative comparison we train a multinomial classifier that maps unseen patterns to the labels discovered by each of the two labeling approaches. The most important result is that the classifier using the area-based feature vector achieves the highest average levels of confidence in its decisions to classify patterns, implying a highly separable feature vector space. We argue this is good news! Not only does the combination of image processing (Watershed) and domain knowledge (traffic flow characteristics) lead to meaningful labels that can be automatically retrieved from large databases of data; this method also leads to a more efficient separation of the resulting feature space. Our next endeavor is to further refine and use this method to develop a search engine for the (rapidly growing) 200 TB historical database of traffic data hosted by the Dutch National Datawarehouse (NDW).}

V2X and Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) technology allows vehicles and traffic infrastructure to communicate with each other, and could facilitate better use of existing resources by providing vehicles information about their surroundings and traffic signals. The information regarding the phase of traffic signal, vehicles’ position and vehicles’ speed can be used by drivers and autonomous vehicle control algorithms to make informed decisions as they approach traffic signals. This research proposes a coordination heuristic to improve traffic flow of CAV vehicles through traffic signals and reduce system wide emissions. A simulation was used to compare the system level impacts to emissions, travel time, and wait time of the proposed coordination heuristic to a single vehicle optimization strategy and baseline driver behavior. The results of this research suggest that traffic density and CAV market penetration impact the potential benefits of CAV control strategies. At low CAV penetration rates both the single vehicle and coordination heuristic produced increased emissions primarily driven by driving behavior of non-V2X enabled vehicles. At higher CAV penetration rates the coordination heuristic significantly outperformed the single vehicle control strategy and baseline driver behavior with regards to emissions reduction. The analysis indicates that at 900 vehicles per hour for either of the two driving strategies: coordination heuristic or single-vehicle optimization, to be more preferred over baseline driver behavior, at least 50\% of the vehicles should be CAV. Once a threshold penetration rate of CAV vehicles is achieved, vehicles following the coordination heuristic generate nearly 10\% fewer CO2emissions than vehicles following baseline driver behavior, a 30\% improvement over the reduction in CO2 emissions obtained using single-vehicle optimization. The vehicles following the coordination heuristic also have less travel time than vehicles following single-vehicle optimization, and less wait times than vehicles following baseline driver behavior.}

However, the deployment of wireless charging lanes on highways and urban road networks can be costly and resource-intensive. A life cycle assessment (LCA) is conducted to compare the sustainability performance of DWPT applied in a network of highways and urban roads for charging electric passenger cars. The assessment compares DWPT to stationary wireless charging and to conventional plug-in charging using a case study of Washtenaw County in Michigan, USA over 20 years. The LCA is based on three key sustainability metrics: costs, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and energy burdens, encompassing not only the use-phase burdens from electricity and fuel, but also the upfront deployment burdens of DWPT infrastructure. A genetic algorithm is applied to optimize the rollout of DWPT infrastructure both spatially and temporally in order to minimize life cycle costs, GHG, and energy burdens: (1) spatial optimization selects road segments to deploy DWPT considering traffic volume, speed, and pavement remaining service life (RSL); (2) temporal optimization determines in which year to deploy DWPT on a particular road segment considering EV market share growth as a function of DWPT coverage rate, future DWPT cost reduction, and charging efficiency improvement. Results indicate that optimal deployment of DWPT electrifying up to about 3\% of total roadway lane-miles reduces life cycle GHG emissions and energy by up to 9.0\% and 6.8\%, respectively, and enables downsizing of the EV battery capacity by up to 48\%, compared to the non-DWPT scenarios. Roadside solar panels and storage batteries are essential to significantly reduce life cycle energy and GHG burdens but bring additional costs. Breakeven analysis indicates a breakeven year for solar charging benefits to pay back the DWPT infrastructure burdens can be less than 20 years for GHG and energy burdens but longer than 20 years for costs. A monetization of carbon emissions of at least \$250 per metric tonne of CO2 is required to shift the optimal “pro-cost” deployment to the optimal “pro-GHG” deployment. A roadway segment with volume greater than about 26,000 vehicle counts per day, speed slower than 55 miles per hour (1 mile ≈ 1.609 km), and pavement RSL shorter than 3 years should be given a high priority for early-stage DWPT deployment.}

While autonomous or higher-level vehicles will be equipped with this technology by default, most of the vehicles on our roadways will lack these advances, so rear-end crashes will dominate accident statistics for many years to come. However, a simple and cost-effective in-vehicle device that uses predictive tools and real-time driver-behavior and roadway data can significantly reduce the likelihood of these crashes. In this paper, we propose a hybrid physics/data-driven approach that can be used in a kinematic-based forward-collision warning system. In particular, we use a hierarchical regularized regression model to estimate driver reaction time based on individual driver characteristics, driving behavior, and surrounding driving conditions. This personalized reaction time is input into the Brill’s one-dimensional car-following model to calculate the critical distance for collision warning. We use the Second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP-2)’s Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) data, the largest and most comprehensive study of its kind, to model driver brake-to-stop response time. The results show that the inclusion of driver characteristics increases model precision in predicting driver reaction times.}

These systems combine connectivity, coordination, adaptivity, and automated response for transportation policy optimization, thus increasing “smartness” and efficiency. However, the control and sensing systems of implemented ITS can open new vulnerabilities, especially to cyber-attacks. Currently vulnerability is managed within the framework of traditional risk assessment that assesses potential failures of the system in response to specified threats. Emerging technologies by their nature have threats that are not fully known, therefore, resilience, defined as the system's ability to recover and adapt to both known and unknown threats, is an emerging area that holds promise for assessing threats to ITS. To illustrate the applicability of resilience to ITS, we conducted a study of network efficiency and resilience in response to random and targeted disruptions of ITS systems in 10 urban areas. Disruptions were generated to affect either intersections or roadways controlled by ITS under different threat scenarios. Modeled attacks, under worst case scenarios, disrupted 20\% of intersections causing on average 14.6\% more additional delays than the same severity attacks on roadways. Additionally, locking traffic signal states was found to cause more disruption than fully disabling signals. Thus, as cities adopt ITS and other smart systems resulting in potentially unknown vulnerabilities, it is important to consider resilience of transportation infrastructure affected by potential cyber-attacks.}

Connected and automated vehicle (CAV) data is now being used to allow vehicles to cooperate better with current and future environments, such as traffic conditions, signal timing, and terrain information. This study proposes an eco-drive algorithm for vehicle fuel consumption optimization on rolling terrains, which frequently causes additional fuel waste due to the inefficient transformation between kinetic and potential energy. The algorithm using the Relaxed Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle (RPMP) is computationally efficient and applicable in real time. While similar algorithms have proven effective in simulations with many assumptions, it is necessary to test these algorithms in the field to better understand the algorithm performance and thus make enhancements to optimally control vehicles for eco-drive. Therefore, this study further tested and verified the newly developed algorithms on an innovative CAV platform and quantified the fuel saving benefits of eco-drive. The proposed eco-drive system is compared against conventional constant speed cruise control on a total of 7 road segments over 47 miles. Experimental data shows that more than 20 percent of fuel consumption can be saved. Detailed analysis through linear models also reveal the main geometrical contributors to the eco-drive fuel savings. This finding can provide a rough estimate of the fuel saving potential of given roadways and help state departments of transportation to identify roadways where eco-drive should be implemented. The algorithm and the experiment can also support original equipment manufacturers in developing and marketing this technology to reduce fuel consumption and emissions in the future.}

The methodology uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) classifier to classify individual data points into one of four basic vehicle flow states (Free Flow, Stopped, Acceleration, and Deceleration) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to identify ‘stop and go’ segments in the trajectory. The identification of vehicle flow state is used for varying the sampling rate. The proposed SAS method can reduce the total amount of data by 67–77\%, while keeping the most critical data points.

Firstly, a new macroscopic model for VSLs is presented, combining characteristics of previously proposed models, in order to have the capability of modeling different capacities, critical densities, and levels of compliance for segments affected by speed limits. Subsequently, the effects of VSLs on the fundamental diagram of traffic flow are studied concluding that, at least for the considered stretch of the A12 freeway, the capacity of the freeway segment is decreased (and the critical density is increased) when the speed limit is reduced from 120 to 90 km/h. Furthermore, analyzing a wider range of VSLs, it is shown that the VSL-induced fundamental diagram is not triangular and that the speed limit compliance can be very low if enforcement measures are not applied. Finally, the proposed model is compared analytically, numerically, and graphically with the two most well-known macroscopic models for VSLs. The analysis and the simulation results show that the proposed model delivers more accurate predictions in cases where the compliance is low and/or the capacity is reduced by the use of VSLs.}

To measure the similarity of human drivers quantitatively, the driving data of every driver are regarded as a specific distribution of some features, fitted with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is introduced as the driving similarity index. After that, an unsupervised clustering algorithm is realized in this paper, and these drivers are grouped into three separate groups.

abstract = {Background
Recent advance in variable message signs (VMS) technology has made it viable to provide spatio-temporal information on traffic and network conditions to drivers. There is a debate whether VMS diverts drivers’ attention away from the road and may cause unnecessary distraction in their driving tasks due to inconsistent VMS contents and formats. There are also other external factors such as weather conditions, visibility and time of day that may affect the integrity and reliability of the VMS. In China, only about 23\% drivers were persuaded by VMS to follow route diversion.
Objective
In order to capture the full benefits of VMS, the aim of this paper is therefore to identify the factors affecting VMS by examining what kinds of VMS contents, formats and their interactions are more preferable to drivers, specifically in China.
Methods
A revealed preference (RP) questionnaire and stated preference (SP) survey consisting of 1154 samples from private and taxi drivers was conducted and analyzed using discrete choice model.
Results
The results revealed that the information showed by amber-on-black on text format, white-on-blue on graph format or the suggested route diversion information showed by single line are preferred by drivers in fog weather. In addition, highly educated drivers or drivers with no occupation are more prone to the qualitative delay time on a text-graph format in fog weather. In normal weather, drivers with working trip purpose are mostly preferred to receive the information on a congested traffic condition with a reason on a text-only format. However, the congested traffic condition along with the information on the apparent causes shown by red-on-black or green-on-black on a text-only format was least preferred by drivers. Regarding current and adjacent road traffic information, drivers prefer to receive the suggested route diversion on a graph-only format in fog weather and the qualitative delay time on a text-graph format in normal weather.

abstract = {Both security and efficiency are important performance areas of air transport systems. Several methods have been proposed to assess security risks and estimate efficiency independently, but only few of these methods identify relationships between security risks and efficiency performance indicators. To analyze security, efficiency, and the relationships relations between them, an agent-based methodology was proposed in this work. This methodology combines an agent-based security risk assessment approach with agent-based efficiency estimation. The methodology was applied to a case study that analyzes security regarding an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) attack, different commonly used efficiency performance indicators in the aviation domain, such as queuing time for passengers, and the relationships between them. Results showed that reducing security risks and improving efficiency were not always conflicting objectives. Reducing the number of passengers before the security checkpoint was found to be an effective measure to reduce security risks and improve efficiency aspects. Furthermore, results showed that airports should attempt to spread passengers across the available space as much as possible to reduce the impact of an IED attack.}

The cooperative trajectory planning problem is formulated as vehicle-level mixed-integer non-linear programs (MINLPs) that aim to minimize travel time of each vehicle and their speed variations, while avoiding near-crash conditions. To push vehicle-level solutions towards global optimality, we develop a coordination scheme between CAVs on conflicting movements. The coordination scheme shares vehicle states (i.e., location) over a prediction horizon and incorporates such information in CAVs’ respective MINLPs. Therefore, the CAVs will reach consensus through an iterative process and select conflict-free trajectories that minimize their travel time. The numerical experiments quantify the effects of the proposed methodology on traffic safety and performance measures in an intersection. The results show that the proposed distributed coordinated framework converges to near-optimal CAV trajectories with no conflicts in the intersection neighborhood. While the solutions are found in real-time, the comparison to a central intersection control logic for CAVs indicates a maximum marginal objective value of 2.30\%. Furthermore, the maximum marginal travel time, throughput, and average speed do not exceed 0.5\%, 0.1\%, and 0.5\%, respectively. The proposed control logic reduced travel time by 43.0–70.5\%, and increased throughput and average speed respectively by 0.8–115.6\% and 59.1–400.0\% compared to an optimized actuated signal control, while eliminating all near-crash conditions.}

In this work we propose a methodology for the optimization of their charging with vehicle-to-grid in parallel with optimized routing and relocation. The methodology presented is based on previous work expanded to include charge optimization. The proposed model optimizes transport service and charging at two different time scales by running two model-predictive control optimization algorithms in parallel. Charging is optimized over longer time scales to minimize both approximate waiting times and electricity costs. Routing and relocation are optimized at shorter time scales to minimize waiting times, with the results of the long-time-scale optimization as charging constraints. This approach allows efficient optimization of both aspects of system operation. The problem is solved as a mixed-integer linear program. A case study using transport and electricity price data for Tokyo is used to test the model. Results show that the system can substantially reduce charging costs without significantly affecting waiting times, with cost reduction dependent on electricity price variability. Vehicle-to-grid is shown to be unsuitable for current electricity and battery prices, however offering substantial savings with price profiles with higher variability.}

This paper presents an approach based on arch formation to alleviate congestion formed by crowds gathering at a bottleneck. In this approach, analyzing a specific self-organized motion pattern, namely, arch formation, the position of the arch formation has a great influence on congestion alleviation. Specifically, an arch formation at an outer position is beneficial for congestion alleviation because it is unstable and collapses easily. The symmetrically placed obstacles, which have a similar role as anti-slide piles, are used to change the position of the arch formation in a crowd. The spacing between the symmetrically placed obstacles is an important parameter for adjusting an arch formation. We present a modified model that originates from the soil mechanics in civil engineering to calculate the proper spacing between the symmetrically placed obstacles. This model analyzes the static attributes of an arch formation and improves the spacing calculation. The proper spacing between symmetrically placed obstacles can alleviate congestion and increase evacuation efficiency. In this paper, the social force model is used to conduct an evacuation simulation, and the simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}

Examining the lower level of automation is more realistic in the foreseeable future. This study considered two automated features such as automated braking and lane keeping assistance which are widely available in the market with low penetration rates. Driving behavior of connected vehicles (CV) and connected vehicles lower level automation (CVLLA) were modeled in the C++ programming language with considering realistic car following models in VISSIM. To this end, safety impact on both segment and intersection crash risks were explored through surrogate safety assessment techniques under various market penetration rates (MPRs). Segment crash risk was analyzed based on both time proximity-based and evasive action-based surrogate measures of safety: time exposed time-to-collision (TET), time integrated time-to-collision (TIT), time exposed rear-end crash risk index (TERCRI), lane changing conflicts (LCC), and number of critical jerks (NCJ). However, the intersection crash risk was evaluated through the number of conflicts extracted from microsimulation (VISSIM) using the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM). A logistic regression model was also developed to quantify the crash risk in terms of observed conflicts obtained in the intersection influence areas. The results suggest that both CV and CVLLA reduce segment crash risk significantly in terms of the five surrogate measures of safety. Furthermore, the logistic regression results clearly showed that both CV and CVLLA have lower intersection crash risks compared to the base scenario. In terms of both segment and intersection crash risks, CVLLA significantly outperforms CV when MPRs are 60\% or higher. Thus, the results indicate a significant safety improvement resulting from implementing CV and CVLLA technologies at both segments and intersections on arterials.}

Are people willing to pay extra for the technology? What demographic and psychological factors can influence people’s WTP for this technology? These questions are not yet well investigated. We conducted surveys in two cities in China (total N = 1355) and examined WTP and its potential demographic determinants (familiarity, age, gender, education, and income) and psychological determinants (perceived benefit and risk of SDVs, anticipated perceived dread riding in SDVs, and trust in SDVs). About 26.3\% of participants were unwilling to pay extra, 39.3\% were willing to pay less than \$2900, and the remaining 34.3\% were willing to pay more than \$2900. Younger and highly educated participants with higher-income were willing to pay more. Participants who had heard about SDVs before the survey reported higher WTP and higher trust and perceived higher benefits, lower risks, and lower dread. Trust and perceived benefit were positive predictors of WTP and perceived risk and perceived dread were negative predictors of WTP. Our results may offer practical implications for increasing the public’s acceptance and WTP of SDVs.}

While many studies accomplished traffic forecasting task with deep learning models, there is still an open issue of exploiting spatial-temporal traffic state features for better prediction performance, and the model interpretability has not been taken serious. In this study, we propose a path based deep learning framework which can produce better traffic speed prediction at a city wide scale, furthermore, the model is both rational and interpretable in the context of urban transportation. Specifically, we divide the road network into critical paths, which is helpful to mine the traffic flow mechanism. Then, each critical path is modeled through the bidirectional long short-term memory neural network (Bi-LSTM NN), and multiple Bi-LSTM layers are stacked to incorporate temporal information. At the stage of traffic prediction, the spatial-temporal features captured from these processes are fed into a fully-connected layer. Finally, results for each path are ensembled for network-wise traffic speed prediction. In the empirical studies, we compare the proposed model with multiple benchmark methods. Under a series of prediction scenarios (i.e., different input and prediction horizons), the superior performance of the proposed framework is validated. Moreover, by analyzing feature from hidden-layer output, the study explains the physical meaning of the hidden feature and illustrate model’s interpretability.}

abstract = {With the development of mobile internet technology, on-demand ridesourcing services have rapidly spread across the world and have caused debates in the transportation industry. While many researchers have begun to study the characteristics and impacts of ridesourcing, there are few published studies specifically on ridesplitting, a ridesourcing service that matches riders with similar origins or destinations to the same ridesourcing driver and vehicle in real time. This paper aims to explore the characteristics and effects of ridesplitting using observed ridesourcing data provided by DiDi Chuxing that contain complete datasets of the ridesourcing trajectories and orders in the city of Chengdu, China. First, a ridesplitting trip identification (RTI) algorithm is developed to separate the shared rides from the single rides (non-ridesplitting orders) and derive ridesplitting scales. Second, a ridesplitting trajectory reconstruction (RTR) algorithm is proposed to estimate the ridesplitting effects on delays and detours. Then, we analyze and compare the scales, spatiotemporal patterns and travel characteristics between shared rides and single rides, which are very different. The results show that the current percentage of ridesplitting in ridesourcing is still low (6–7\%), which may be explained by the extra delay (about 10 min on average), detour (about 1.55 km on average), and degraded travel time reliability caused by ridesplitting. In addition, built environment factors, such as density, diversity, and development, are also correlated with ridesplitting demand and delay. The findings of this study can help better understand the features of ridesplitting and develop strategies for improving its use in emerging ridesourcing services.}

Firstly, we develop three explicit Integer Linear Programming (ILP) models to formulate: the bus driver scheduling, bus & driver scheduling, and bus & driver scheduling with mealtime windows, respectively. These ILP models enable bus operators to solve their bus & driver scheduling problems by directly invoking an available optimization solver such as IBM ILOG CPLEX. However, our numerical experiments do not show remarkable improvements, as CPLEX takes more than 12, 17, and 35 h respectively to reduce the optimality gap to at most 0.5\% for solving the above three models in an over 12-hour bus & driver scheduling problem. To improve the computational efficiency, we develop a valid inequality approach that can generate valid cuts incorporating with the CPLEX. An investigation into the valid inequality approach proves its high computational efficiency. In addition, we develop a self-adaptive search method for determining the upper and lower bounds of driver group and bus fleet sizes. Finally, we test our models and approaches on a real round-trip bus route. The results indicate that compared with the only use of CPLEX to solve the above three models, the valid inequality approach can address large-scale instances in a reasonable CPU time.}

To address this problem, after modeling of a WMR incorporating wheel actuators dynamics, optimization-based nonlinear control laws are analytically developed for the kinematic and dynamic based controllers using the prediction of WMR responses. The tracking precision is more increased, under disturbances and uncertainties by appending the integral feedback technique to the design method. The performed analyses as well as the simulation results show that the tracking errors are remarkably decreased by the proposed control system in the presence of model uncertainties and disturbances. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed controller is compared with that of a sliding mode controller, reported in the literature, through simulation results.}

In parallel, mobile phone data have emerged as the largest mobility data source, but are not yet integrated to transport planning models. Currently, transport authorities are lacking a global picture of daily passenger flows on multimodal transport networks. In this work, we propose the first methodology to infer dynamic Origin-Destination flows by transport modes using mobile network data e.g., Call Detail Records. For this study, we pre-process 360 million trajectories for more than 2 million devices from the Greater Paris as our case study region. The model combines mobile network geolocation with transport network geospatial data, travel survey, census and travel card data. The transport modes of mobile network trajectories are identified through a two-steps semi-supervised learning algorithm. The later involves clustering of mobile network areas and Bayesian inference to generate transport probabilities for trajectories. After attributing the mode with highest probability to each trajectory, we construct Origin-Destination matrices by transport mode. Flows are up-scaled to the total population using state-of-the-art expansion factors. The model generates time variant road and rail passenger flows for the complete region. From our results, we observe different mobility patterns for road and rail modes and between Paris and its suburbs. The resulting transport flows are extensively validated against the travel survey and the travel card data for different spatial scales.}

The optimal sites of street parking facilities incur shortest queuing delay in the capacitated network. We first propose a variational inequality to formulate the heterogeneous quantal response equilibrium (HQRE) for parkers in non-cooperative parking game and the logit-based stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) for travelers traversing the area. The HQRE is developed under the “infinite cyclic flows” assumption, allowing all possible routes, containing the cyclic routes of all times including the infinite. Therefore boundedly rational parkers who search the same curb for more than once via cyclic cruising strategies can be modeled in the parking game. Then based on the equilibrium conditions, the MPEC was developed to minimize the total queuing delay for all drivers in the area. The radial basis function (RBF) model algorithm, one of the surrogate model-based algorithms, was proposed to iteratively solve the MPEC problem. A numerical example from a real working area is presented to illustrate the proposed MPEC problem. The numerical results show that the traffic flow increase caused by cruising for parking can be presented by our model. In addition, the appropriate allocation should avoid parking spaces at the curbs of arterial where travelers drive for traversing the area and the streets intersecting the arterial.}

In this paper, we propose a CB line planning framework called CB-Planner, which is applicable to multiple travel data sources. A mathematical programming formulation is proposed to simultaneously optimize bus stop locations, bus routes, timetables and passengers’ probabilities of choosing CB. We then developed a heuristic solution framework that includes a grid-density based clustering method for discovering potential travel demands efficiently, a bus stop deployment algorithm to minimize the number of stops and walking distance, and dynamic programming based routing and timetabling algorithms for maximizing estimated profit. We conduct an experiment on a small-scale network to verify the performance gap between the optimal solution and our proposed heuristic solution. A case study is then conducted on one-month taxi trajectory data in Nanjing, China. The study demonstrates that CB lines generated by our CB-Planner can achieve higher profit compared with baseline methods, and they also provide efficient transit services with short walk distances and small departure time adjustments. The moderate increase in travel time is paid off by the significant savings in travel fare.}

Traffic video data collected from the two signalized intersections (left-hand traffic regulations) were used for analysis. Automated computer vision analysis techniques were used to extract vehicle trajectories and identify field-measured conflicts. Simulated conflicts were obtained using VISSIM and SSAM tool. A two-step calibration procedure was performed to test the correlation between simulated and field-measured conflicts. In addition, the spatial distributions of simulated and field-measured conflicts were compared. Finally, the calibration results for the left-hand traffic environment were compared with results for signalized intersections in Canada and China (right-hand traffic environment). The results indicated a good correlation between simulated and field-measured conflicts, especially at higher TTC thresholds. However, major differences between field-measured and simulated conflict spatial distributions indicate that despite the good correlation obtained via calibration, simulated conflicts do not adequately capture the actual conflict occurrence mechanism. It was also found that there were significant differences between the left-hand and right-hand traffic environments calibration results.}

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel, computational efficient, dynamic ridesharing algorithm. The beneficial computational properties of the algorithm arise from casting the ridesharing problem as a linear assignment problem between fleet vehicles and customer trip requests within a federated optimization architecture. The resulting algorithm is up to four times faster than the state-of-the-art, even if it is implemented on a less dedicated hardware, and achieves similar service quality. Current literature showcases the ability of state-of-the-art ridesharing algorithms to tackle very large fleets and customer requests in almost near real-time, but the benefits of ridesharing seem limited to centralized systems. Our algorithm suggests that this does not need to be the case. The algorithm that we propose is fully distributable among multiple ridesharing companies. By leveraging two datasets, the New York city taxi dataset and the Melbourne Metropolitan Area dataset, we show that with our algorithm, real-time ridesharing offers clear benefits with respect to more traditional taxi fleets in terms of level of service, even if one considers partial adoption of the system. In fact, e.g., the quality of the solutions obtained in the state-of-the-art works that tackle the whole customer set of the New York city taxi dataset is achieved, even if one considers only a proportion of the fleet size and customer requests. This could make real-time urban-scale ridesharing very attractive to small enterprises and city authorities alike. However, in some cases, e.g., in multi-company scenarios where companies have predefined market shares, we show that the number of vehicles needed to achieve a comparable performance to the monopolistic setting increases, and this raises concerns on the possible negative effects of multi-company ridesharing.}

The scarce long-term estimation strategies currently found in the literature are commonly based on the detection and assignment to patterns, but their performance decays when unexpected events provoke non predictable changes, or if the allocation to a traffic pattern is inaccurate. This work introduces a method to obtain long-term pattern forecasts and adapt them to real-time circumstances. To this end, a long-term estimation scheme based on the automated discovery of patterns is proposed and integrated with an on-line change detection and adaptation mechanism. The framework takes advantage of the architecture of evolving Spiking Neural Networks (eSNN) to perform adaptations without retraining the model, allowing the whole system to work autonomously in an on-line fashion. Its performance is assessed over a real scenario with 5 min data of a 6-month span of traffic in the center of Madrid, Spain. Significant accuracy gains are obtained when applying the proposed on-line adaptation mechanism on days with special, non-predictable events that degrade the quality of their long-term traffic forecasts.}

These critical conflicts, however, are potentially avoidable with Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) technology. However, current literature using CAV technology mostly focuses on merging maneuvers between a single-lane mainline and an incoming ramp. An algorithm dealing with multilane merging areas is absent. In this paper, an online system control algorithm for multilane freeway merging areas is presented with a CAV environment based on optimizing vehicles’ lane changing and car following trajectories. First, the lane flow distribution is adjusted upstream of the merging point under a rule-based lane changing decision, which eventually balances downstream lane flow distribution. A Cooperative Lane Changing Control (CLCC) optimization model is proposed to ensure safe and smooth lane changing execution. Second, a Cooperative Merging Control (CMC) model is adopted, analyzed, and generalized to conduct merging maneuvers around the merging point. Third, a dynamic moving border point method is designed to coordinate the consecutive execution of the CLCC and CMC models. To validate the proposed algorithm, a simulation platform based on VISSIM is developed for online computation and visualization. A typical two-lane freeway merging area is studied. Results under various demand scenarios demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms previous cooperative merging algorithms consistently with respect to delays and average travel speeds.}

The infrastructure managers have to come up with smart maintenance decisions in order to improve the assets’ condition, spend optimal cost and keep the network available. Currently, the infrastructure managers lack the tools and decision support models that could assist them in taking (un) planned maintenance decisions effectively and efficiently. Recently, many literature studies have proposed to employ the machine learning techniques to estimate the performance state of an asset, predict the maintenance need, possible failure modes, and such similar aspects in advance. Most of these studies have utilised additional data collection measures to record the assets’ behaviour. Though useful for experimentation, it is expensive and impractical to mount monitoring devices on multiple assets across the network. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop predictive models that utilise existing data from a railway agency and yield interpretable results. We propose to leverage the tree-based classification techniques of machine learning in order to predict maintenance need, activity type and trigger’s status of railway switches. Using the data from an in-use business process, predictive models based on the decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosted trees are developed. Moreover, to facilitate in models interpretability, we provided a detail explanation of models’ predictions by features importance analysis and instance level details. Our solution approach of predictive models development and their results explanation have wider applicability and can be used for other asset types and different (maintenance) planning scenarios.}

This paper studies the impact of the transition in automated driving capabilities (driving mode choice) on road congestion pricing and vice versa, accounting for the interdependencies between traffic flow, the choice level of autonomous driving, effective road capacity and marginal travel cost. It is shown that (in a more or less distant future) when drivers can choose among various levels of car automation during a trip and when shortcomings associated with autonomous driving – e.g. adverse effects regarding privacy, software hacking, liability, safety, driving pleasure, manual control recovery – are non-negligible, their generalized user cost curve is the lower envelope of a swarm of traffic flow dependent individual cost curves whose slope is determined by the level of autonomous driving. This has several implications for our understanding of Pigouvian road congestion pricing. Most importantly, marginal social trip costs are then no longer convex and strictly increasing in traffic flow even when traffic is only ‘normally congested’, thereby introducing the possibility of multiple congestion pricing equilibria even in the absence of what is usually called ‘hypercongestion’. When inconveniences related to autonomous driving are sufficiently high, the imposition of congestion tolls may lead to a situation where drivers abandon autonomous technologies entirely and opt instead for fully manual driving. Our findings suggest that the emergence of advanced autonomous driving capabilities and the transition from manual to automated control on the road will probably make congestion pricing more, not less, complex for researchers and policymakers.}

While GPS data, typically collected by smartphone apps, are restricted to rather small samples of the population, mobile phone network data, routinely collected by mobile network operators, potentially allow to analyze travel behaviors and social interaction of the whole population, with full temporal (e.g., longitudinal) coverage at a comparatively low cost. Therefore, recent years have seen an increasing interest in using such data for human mobility studies. However, due to their noisy and temporally infrequent/irregular nature, extracting mobility information such as transport modes from these data is particularly challenging. This paper provides an in-depth, systematic review of transport mode detection based on mobile phone network data. The results of the review show that existing studies tend to identify easy-to-detect modes (e.g., train or metro), or aggregate fine-grained modes into more general groups (e.g., public versus private transport). Rule-based methods making use of geographic data were often developed. More importantly, due to the lack of ground truth data, evaluation of the proposed methods was seldom done and reported. Finally, we identify a list of research gaps currently being faced in this field, particularly regarding robust and real-time data cleaning and mode detection methods, “benchmark” datasets and metrics allowing the comparison of different mode detection methods, as well as privacy and bias issues.}

Over 1 million vehicles, with different powertrain types (conventional and numerous electrified powertrains) and component technologies (advanced engines, batteries, electrical machines, light weighting) are simulated for outputs including vehicle fuel economy and cost. Despite the ability of Autonomie to predict fuel economy given various combination of vehicle inputs, the full-vehicle simulation is very time-consuming. It takes approximately 84 h to simulate for 33,060 vehicles even using distributed computing on a cluster of 128 worker nodes. Moreover, Autonomie is unable to populate a continuous output space through simulation since it only yields outputs with discrete values instead of an input-output relation. This paper proposes a novel large-scale learning and prediction process (LSLPP) via machine learning approaches to answer the need for a continuous space of vehicle fuel economy and a more efficient simulation process. By learning in a supervised fashion to discover structures in data, the machine learning approaches seek to train a model that can explain the data with which we can perform prediction over unseen data. As such, we are able to accomplish analytic continuation on the current discrete space of simulation results. In addition, we present a random-sampling-based numerosity reduction algorithm incorporated in LSLPP that reduces simulation runs and improves efficiency of data procurement. We analytically derive a theoretical bound in order to guarantee the effectiveness of our algorithm. We also compare random sampling to stratified sampling and suggest sampling strategies. A user-friendly tool is developed to support the process. Our experimental results confirm that the proposed LSLPP is able to greatly accelerate prediction and analysis of vehicle fuel economy. The output of this study is used by the US government to evaluate the impact of its R&D funding on energy security and CO2 emission as well as for the setting of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards.}

One commonly accepted definition of travel time reliability, given by the Federal Highway Administration, states that “Drivers are used to congestion and they expect and plan for some delay, but most travelers are less tolerant of unexpected delays. Travel time reliability measures the extent of this unexpected delay.” However, most widely used measures of travel time reliability replace the notion of “reliability” with “variability,” and there lacks measure that directly incorporates the unforeseen levels of travel time. Thus, we extended travel time reliability from the perspective of predictability based on the Lempel–Ziv algorithm in the field of information theory, which provides an upper bound of travel time predictability based on historical data. To demonstrate the advantages of proposed measure and correlations with traditional metrics, we conduct thorough case studies with various data sources along with artificial simulations to explore the nature of the proposed predictability measure and its distinct features from other reliability measures.}

One public policy objective of carsharing is to reduce vehicle miles travelled (VMT), which happens as members (renters) reduce car ownership. With a P2P system, VMT reductions could also occur if vehicle owners leave their car to be rented when they would normally drive. This paper assesses how participation in P2P carsharing affects the driving behavior of participating car owners. Data are from 235 car owners in Portland, Oregon who enrolled in a P2P program. The analysis is based on surveys, vehicle use data collected via in-vehicle GPS, and in-depth interviews. Overall, vehicle owners made very few changes to their driving behavior according to the GPS data, with average vehicle use increasing slightly. However, a subset of owners (39\%) did decrease their driving by 10\% or more one year after the baseline. Factors associated with this reduction in use included higher baseline vehicle use, higher rental activity, income constraints, and more flexibility in daily travel. In addition, some owners appear to use P2P as a catalyst to change travel behavior, including increased use of other modes.}

Accidents can also occur because drivers, cyclists and pedestrians do not have the information they need to avoid wrong decisions. In these cases, the missing information can be computed and broadcast by an intelligent intersection. The information gives the current full signal phase, an estimate of the time when the phase will change, and the occupancy of the blind spots of the driver or autonomous vehicle. The paper develops a design of the intelligent intersection, motivated by the analysis of an accident at an intersection in Tempe, AZ, between an automated Uber Volvo and a manual Honda CRV and culminates in a proposal for an intelligent intersection infrastructure. The intelligent intersection also serves as a software-enabled version of the ‘protected intersection’ design to improve the passage of cyclists and pedestrians through an intersection.}

We explicitly model the economies-of-scale as a concave piece-wise linear function and congestion as a convex function. The problem is modeled as a nonlinear mixed integer program that is difficult to solve directly since the objective function has both convex and concave nonlinear terms and hence finding an optimal solution may not be easy. A Lagrangian approach is proposed to obtain tight upper and lower bounds. The Lagrangian decomposition exploits the structure of the problem and decomposes it to convex and concave subproblems. Furthermore, we add some valid inequalities to accelerate the convergence rate of the Lagrangian heuristic. To tackle large instances, a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) is developed. Both the Lagrangian heuristic and GRASP provide high-quality solutions within reasonable computational time. The optimal designs of hub-and-spoke networks with nonlinear inter-hub economies-of-scale and congestion at hub locations are analyzed in comparison with other models in the literature to demonstrate the significant impact of modeling nonlinearity in economies-of-scale and congestion simultaneously rather than independently.}

This work develops a new methodology to determine the optimized PT timetable integrated with vehicle scheduling, including the possibility of using the skip-stop tactic based on real-time passenger demand. The consideration of a skip-stop operation allows for a reduction in the passengers’ total travel time and in the number of autonomous shuttle vehicles in use. The analysis is based on the deficit function (DF) graphical concept and considers the constraints of the vehicle with regard to capacity. The methodology is developed for a single-depot bidirectional circle ASBS route using the DF as a multi-decision choice model. Because of the complexity involved in large-size genetic algorithm problems, a binary-variable iteration method is applied to attain efficient solutions. A case study in Auckland, New Zealand, is employed to assess the new model. The case study shows a reduction of 1.83\% in total passenger travel time and 8.11\% in the number of vehicles as compared to solutions that do not consider the skip-stop tactic. Moreover, it is shown that the advanced DF-based methodology could be used to develop fully autonomous PT in a network in the future.}

abstract = {Slot scheduling has emerged as an issue of major concern at congested airports. A commonly used metric for assessing airport slot scheduling efficiency is total schedule displacement. In addition to schedule efficiency, fairness has also been identified as another important slot scheduling criterion. However, the literature currently does not provide sufficient modelling capabilities for investigating the single airport slot scheduling efficiency-fairness trade-off. The objective of this paper is to develop and solve a novel airport slot scheduling model which considers simultaneously slot scheduling efficiency and fairness objectives. We introduce a fairness metric for slot scheduling and formulate the airport slot scheduling problem as a bi-objective optimization model which considers fairness and efficiency simultaneously. We use an integrated solution framework that combines the ε-constraint method and a row generation algorithm to solve the proposed bi-objective model. We investigate the slot scheduling efficiency-fairness trade-off under the following two slot scheduling regimes: (i) a regime that considers historical slot usage rights (hierarchical), and (ii) a regime that does not consider historical slot usage rights (non-hierarchical). The proposed model generates the efficient frontiers describing the slot scheduling efficiency-fairness trade-off for both slot scheduling regimes. The results of the model are presented at the aggregate (airport-wide) and disaggregate (individual) airline level providing information that enhances the transparency of slot scheduling decisions. The efficient frontiers produced by the proposed model can facilitate discussions among different stakeholders in making slot scheduling decisions.}

Yet, the factors affecting the frequency of use of these services are not well understood. In this paper, we investigate how the frequency of use of ridehailing varies across segments of the California population and under various circumstances. We analyze data from the California Millennials Dataset (N = 1975), collected in fall 2015 through an online survey administered to both millennials and members of the preceding Generation X. We estimate an ordered probit model with sample selection and a zero-inflated ordered probit model with correlated error terms to distinguish the factors affecting the frequency of use of ridehailing from those affecting the adoption of these services. The results are consistent across models: sociodemographic variables are important predictors of service adoption but do not explain much of the variation in the frequency of use. Land use mix and activity density respectively decrease and increase the frequency of ridehailing. The results also confirm that individuals who frequently use smartphone apps to manage other aspects of their travel (e.g. to select a route or check traffic) are more likely to adopt ridehailing and use it more often. This is also true for long-distance travelers, in particular, those who frequently travel by plane for leisure purposes. Individuals with higher willingness to pay to reduce their travel time use ridehailing more often. Those with stronger preferences to own a personal vehicle and those with stronger concerns about the safety/security of ridehailing are less likely to be frequent users. These results provide new insights into the adoption and use of ridehailing that could help to inform planning and forecasting efforts.}

abstract = {In a platoon of connected vehicles, time headway plays an important role in both traffic capacity and road safety. It is desirable to maintain a lower time headway while satisfying string stability in a platoon, since this leads to a higher traffic capacity and guarantees the disturbance attenuation ability. In this paper, we study a multiple-predecessor following strategy to reduce time headway via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. We first introduce a new definition of desired inter-vehicle distances based on the constant time headway (CTH) policy, which is suitable for general communication topologies. By exploiting lower-triangular structures in a time headway matrix and an information topology matrix, we derive a set of necessary and sufficient conditions on feedback gains for internal asymptotic stability. Further, by analyzing the stable region of feedback gains, a necessary and sufficient condition on time headway is also obtained for the string stability specification. It is proved that a platoon can be asymptotically stable and string stable when the time headway is lower bounded. Moreover, this bound can be reduced by increasing the number of predecessors. These results explicitly highlight the benefits of V2V communication on reducing time headway for platooning of connected vehicles.}

This task is usually explored based on the sensors’ pre-calibration (e.g. height or pitch angle), but can be challenging when the calibration fails (e.g. on the sloping and uneven roads). In this work, we propose a calibrated feature-point based (CFPB) method to estimate the car-following distance adaptive to rough roads, using a single camera. Instead of using the pre-calibrated parameters, CFPB method is based on the surrounding vehicles’ feature points. It benefits from the fixed coordinate relations among these points, which enables the algorithm to be adaptive to rough roads. These fixed coordinate relations can be calibrated during driving. Namely, after a few seconds of observation to a surrounding vehicle, the CFPB method can start working for more accurate estimation. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm takes the perspective-n-point method as the framework. YOLO V3 and scale-invariant feature transform are applied as the vehicle detector and feature point extractor. The feature point calibration is dynamically updated and the results are smoothened by a Kalman filter. The camera is chosen because of the good performance on objects detection and feature extraction. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a real-world road with dynamic traffic flow. Mobileye, a widely used car-following distance estimator on AV, is installed during the tests as the benchmark. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves decimeter-level accuracy and outperforms the Mobileye system in cases where the road slope changes significantly.}

This paper proposes a cumulative prospect theory (CPT) based modeling framework to describe the charging behavior of BEV drivers. CPT captures an individual’s attitude and preference toward risk in the decision-making process. A BEV mass-market scenario is constructed using the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data. This paper applies the CPT-based charging behavior model to study the battery state-of-charge (SOC) when drivers decide to charge their vehicles, charging timing and location choices, and charging power demand profile under the mass-market scenario. In addition, sensitivity analyses are used to examine the drivers’ risk attitudes and public charger network coverage. BEV drivers who display a higher degree of risk-seeking tend to charge vehicles at a lower SOC. Some home charging shifts to workplace and public charging as the public charger network expands, but home charging still plays the most significant role in BEV use. The power demand from public chargers increases significantly with BEV expansion and has a larger impact on the power grid. The time-of-use (TOU) electricity rate can shift peak power demand to off-peak periods from midnight to early morning.}

Using foot-by-foot track geometry and tonnage data, this paper develops a new machine learning based approach to identify the track geometry parameters that contribute most to the prediction of rail defects occurrences. Taking more than 60 types of track geometry measurements into account, this study develops a Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) algorithm for feature selection and compares its results with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). In addition, to capture more knowledge from the geometry data, some additional features, including Track Quality Index (TQI), energy spectral density, and time-trend are extracted. This, in turn, facilitates the learning and predicting process. Moreover, since there exists a very limited number of rail defects, the Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Approach (ADASYN) is applied to overcome the issue of imbalance in the dataset. In terms of machine learning algorithms, the proposed approach employs an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm in which the hyper-parameters are optimized using a Bayesian optimization method. Furthermore, the proposed approach investigates the impact of each track geometry parameter as well as a subset of them on rail defects occurrences with Partial Dependence Analysis (PDA). Finally, our approach is implemented on a six-year dataset with over 60 million track geometry records collected from a 100-mile section of a U.S. Class I railroad to demonstrate its applicability and efficiency.}

Part of the problem relates to the difficulty in collecting comprehensive and reliable information early enough to prepare mitigation measures. A tool that automatically scans the internet for events and predicts their impact would strongly support transport management in many cities in the world. This study addresses the challenges related to retrieving and analyzing web documents about real world events, and using them for demand explanation (if related to a past event) and prediction (if a future one). Transport demand is predicted with a supervised topic modeling algorithm by utilizing information about social events retrieved using various strategies, which made use of search aggregation, natural language processing, and query expansion. It was found that a two-step process produced the highest accuracy for transport demand prediction, where different (but related) queries are used to retrieve an initial set of documents, and then, based on these documents, a final query is constructed that obtains the set of predictive documents. These are then used to model the most discriminating topics related to the transport demand. A framework was proposed that sequentially handles all stages of data gathering, enrichment, and prediction with the intention of generating automated search queries.}

However, it is challenging to evaluate various optimizations and controls in real-world traffic scenarios due to safety and technical concerns. In light of this, our previous work has developed a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed with a laboratory powertrain research platform to evaluate CAV applications. An actual engine is loaded by a hydrostatic dynamometer whose loading torque is controlled in real-time by the simulated vehicle dynamics. The HIL testbed mimics the performance of a target vehicle and the dynamometer generates the same load as the target vehicle. In this work, the HIL testbed is further enhanced to match the performance of actual testing vehicles at the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and a living lab is developed to incorporate real traffic information. The same engine as the actual testing vehicles at the FHWA was installed and the vehicle models were calibrated using testing data from actual vehicles. The same roadway conditions (speed limit, the degree of road slope, etc.) were input into the testbed and the dynamometer generates the same load as an actual vehicle’s engine is getting. The HIL testbed emulates the performance of an actual vehicle and both fuel consumption and emissions are measured by precise instruments in the lab. In eight testing scenarios, the results have shown that the performance of the HIL testbed matches very well with the actual testing vehicles with about 1\% error. In addition, the living lab has enabled the HIL testbed to interact with real traffic and extended the testing capabilities of the HIL testbed. Two new testing capabilities have been demonstrated through two CAV applications. This is an exciting result since the HIL testbed could provide an effective and economical way for the testing of fuel consumption and emissions on various roadway conditions for CAVs and other types of vehicles.}

Nowadays, active user participation is starting to take shape with the development of new apps with commercial market potential. This study focuses on willingness to share travel information as part of daily routine transit app use. The applied behavioral framework is the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology adapted to the context of information sharing. The empirical analysis consists of estimating a structural equation model on a data set including 1,369 people from Innsbruck and Copenhagen as cities differing in size and general social trust. The results show that the most important motivational factors for information sharing are pro-sharing social norms and self-actualization weighted against effort expectancy, which is more closely related to the logistic effort of using the platform than to network familiarity. Trust in the information provided and social network engagement are secondary motivational factors, with perceived information quality and need of communication being less influential. Greater transit use and interest in level-of-service and real-time information are correlated with greater information sharing motivation. Women and generation Z had higher motivation for information sharing as well as people who reside in Denmark, a country with high social trust.}

A key enabler is a train control system that is able to respond to unforeseen disturbances in the system (e.g., incidents, train delays), and to adjust and coordinate the train headways and speeds. This paper proposes a multi-train cooperative control model based on the dynamic features during train longitude movement to adjust train following headway. In particular, our model simultaneously considers several practical constraints, e.g., train controller output constraints, safe train following distance, as well as communication delays and resources. Then, this control problem is solved through a rolling horizon approach by calculating the Riccati equation with Lagrangian multipliers. Due to the practical communication resource constraints and riding comfort requirement, we also improved the rolling horizon approach into a novel self-triggered model predictive control scheme to overcome these issues. Finally, two case studies are given through simulation experiments. The simulation results are analyzed which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}

Amazon were among the first to introduce the idea of using drones to deliver goods, followed by several other distribution companies working on similar services. The Traveling Salesman Problem, frequently used for planning last-mile delivery operations, can easily be modified to incorporate drones, resulting in a routing problem involving both the truck and aircraft. Introduced by Murray and Chu (2015), the Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesman Problem considers a drone and truck collaborating. The drone can be launched and recovered at certain visits on the truck route, making it possible for both vehicles to deliver goods to customers in parallel. This generalization considerably decreases the operational cost of the routes, by reducing the total fuel consumption for the truck, as customers on the routes can be serviced by drones without covering additional miles for the trucks, and hence increase productivity. In this paper a mathematical model is formulated, defining a problem similar to the Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesman Problem, but for the capacitated multiple-truck case with time limit constraints and minimizing cost as objective function. The corresponding problem is denoted the Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones. Due to the difficulty of solving large instances to optimality, an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search metaheuristic is proposed. Finally, extensive computational experiments are carried out. The tests investigate, among other things, how beneficial the inclusion of the drone-delivery option is compared to delivering all items using exclusively trucks. Moreover, a detailed sensitivity analysis is performed on several drone-parameters of interest.}

However, the raw trajectories are not always accurate and complete due to technical and privacy issues.

By processing many-day raw trajectories, we observe a set of historical choices of location-duration-path and identify missing observations in space and time dimensions. To improve computational efficiency, we apply data-driven network-time prisms that reduce the search space for the missing choices. Then, we formulate Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) models with likelihood bounds, a special case of data-driven optimization models using phi-divergences (i.e., χ2 distance), to reconstruct the missing choices. To solve the minimax programs of the DRO models while maintaining tractability, we reformulate and solve the equivalent dual problems of the DRO models based on the strong duality theory. To demonstrate and validate the proposed models, we use a real-world connected vehicle dataset containing around 2,800 connected vehicles over two separate months in Southeast Michigan from the Safety Pilot Model Deployment (SPMD) project and a transportation network from OpenStreetMap.}

The results indicate that automated vehicles’ shared mobility systems can provide approximately six times higher occupancy rates than conventional private cars, but that their costs – in Switzerland – are considerably higher than those of subsidized public transport or private cars in the short term. However, these services are predicted to be considerably cheaper than the full costs of owning and using a private car, which makes the long-term adoption of automated taxi services likely. Simulations demonstrate that choice of fleet operational policy determining customer-vehicle assignment and repositioning of empty vehicles (rebalancing) heavily influences system performance, e.g., wait times and cost.

Using these data we developed EV drivers charging choice models based on hybrid choice modeling (HCM) framework, incorporating risk attitude and different decision strategies. The HCM binary logit model results indicate that the risk attitude variable is a significant predictor of EV drivers’ charging choices. Comparing the two HCM latent class logit (LCL) models, the attribute non-attendance (ANA) LCL model gets a better goodness-of-fit over the fully compensatory LCL model. The ANA LCL model result shows that the EV drivers are divided into two classes: risk averse class focuses primarily on the amount of excess or buffer range they have available to complete their next trip; and risk seeking class balances price against their current state of charge.

This mechanism enables one to evaluate whether appropriately relocating sensors can optimize the utilization of the surveillance resources and further enhance the surveillance benefits over a given time horizon. We applied the proposed optimization framework to a mixed arterial-freeway commuting network located in Washington. D.C.-Baltimore metropolitan area. The study empirically revealed and illustrated two interesting findings: (1) relocation operations do bring additional surveillance benefits on travel time prediction, and the marginal benefit is highly correlated with the sensor fleet size; (2) spatial measurement is not a trivial part in travel time prediction, and one should fully recognize the effectiveness of temporal and spatial measurements when designing a traffic sensor network for real-time travel time surveillance.}

abstract = {Observations from empirical data in the roadway network showed that the relation between averages of network flow versus density often exhibit hysteresis and bifurcation phenomena, which may obscure the reproducibility of a well-defined macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD). In this paper, we analyzed large-scale trip data from passenger vehicles in an urban network of South Korea and evaluated the shapes of MFDs over many days. It was found that MFDs have two distinctive, reproducible forms: a well-defined, unique relation on weekends and a bifurcation in high-density regime on weekdays. With regard to the bifurcation, we observed higher network flows in the morning and lower network flows in the evening for the same average network density. This implies that the same set of drivers in the network collectively formed two different trip patterns. Hence, we evaluated possible factors that may have effects on the bifurcation phenomenon. In view of this, four factors – heterogeneity, trip completion rate, detouring ratio and commute trips – were analyzed in this study. The findings showed that travelers’ detours could be a key factor for the occurrence of bifurcation because, by detouring travelers improve neither their own travel times nor network-wide travel times, and thereby degrade the network production.}

Next, we formulate the problem of designing the locations and capacities of charging facilities under a fixed budget constraint and solve the optimization problem with a customized neighborhood search strategy. A lower bound for the system cost is also developed to evaluate the qualities of solutions acquired using our proposed heuristic. Numerical examples with a toy network and a highway network extracted from the Yangtze River Delta are used to show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, and we observe that our strategy can solve a large-scale problem within an optimality gap of less than 5\%.}

abstract = {In this paper, we develop a novel reliable path finding algorithm for a stochastic road network with uncertainty in travel times while both electric vehicle energy and efficiency are simultaneously taken into account. We first propose a bi-objective optimization model to maximize (1) the on-time arrival reliability and (2) energy-efficiency for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in a path finding problem. The former objective requires finding the reliable shortest path (RSP), which is the path with the minimal effective travel time measured by the sum of the mean travel time and a travel time safety margin for any given origin-destination (OD) pair. Then, we refer to energy-efficiency as the minimum of the electric energy consumption. We discuss the non-additive property of the RSP problem since we also consider the link travel time correlations, whereas the latter objective satisfies the additive criterion. To this end, we illustrate the existence of non-dominated solutions that satisfy both of the two objectives. Furthermore, it is shown that the intersection of two candidate sets – one for the RSPs and the other for paths with minimal energy-consumption - actually contains the optimal solution for the bi-objective optimization problem. The upper and lower bounds of the effective travel time are mathematically deduced and can be used to generate the candidate path set of this bi-objective problem via the K-shortest algorithm. Our proposed algorithm overcomes the infeasibility of traditional path finding algorithms (e.g., the Dijkstra algorithm) for RSPs. Moreover, using two numerical examples, we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. We numerically demonstrate promising potential applications of the proposed algorithm in real-life road traffic networks.}

In this study we present a stated-choice survey to investigate the attractiveness to customers of two mechanisms for managing fleet volatility: Virtual Queuing (VQ) and Guaranteed Advance Reservation (GAR). We investigate socio-demographic features and “Big Five” personality traits that are associated ceteris paribus with choosing to use the existing FFCS service model, willingness-to-pay (WTP) for VQ and GAR, and risky-choice behaviour under the uncertainty of FFCS systems. Data (n = 289; 232 employed in analysis) are sourced from existing users of a FFCS service in London, UK. Within the survey context, we found that customers are on average not willing to pay for VQ (i.e. negative WTP), however have £0.54 per journey WTP for GAR, with low-frequency FFCS users and users scoring highly on the Big Five “Conscientiousness” dimension having larger WTP for GAR. When analysing the two dimensions of uncertainty, we found that respondents exhibit risk-seeking behaviour towards price and weaker and insignificant risk-aversion towards walking time. This pattern holds across the three standard model types of nonlinear risky-choice behaviour that we investigated. The results are intended to be useful both to policymakers and carsharing operators who are likely, as the industry matures, to seek mechanisms to differentiate their service offers to better serve individual market segments with distinctive characteristics.}

Timetables for railway services may dampen delay propagations to subsequent trains by adding either supplement time or buffer time to the timetable. The evaluation of these variables is often performed by time consuming analysis with simulation software, or other complex, time-consuming calculations. This paper proposes instead an analytical closed form formulation of aggregate delay, which offers theoretical insights into railway delays and managerial insight into the properties of timetables at an aggregate level, and which may function as a fast sub-algorithm for timetable evaluations in larger optimization and transport models. Analysis of the function recommends a restraint in the utilization of timetable supplement and buffer, as their delay-damping effect decreases with their magnitude. Further, the effect of different threshold values in delay measurement is demonstrated, giving information valuable to the design of service contracts. Numerical analysis of a common suburban railway line shows that the polynomial function provides guidance and insight even when theoretical assumptions are violated.}

Previous research suggests that traffic management measures using advanced Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems could reduce congestion on freeways, but little is known about their potential effectiveness at sags. This article evaluates the effectiveness of a basic ACC system (B-ACC) and two advanced ACC systems – Traffic State-Adaptive ACC (TSA-ACC) and Cooperative ACC (C-ACC) – in mitigating congestion at sags. TSA-ACC adapts the ACC parameters to the macroscopic traffic state estimated by the vehicle itself. C-ACC uses information of other vehicles in the surroundings to adjust its accelerations. Results are obtained using microscopic traffic simulations with different penetration rates. They show that, under high-demand conditions, congestion decreases with increasing percentage of vehicles equipped with B-ACC. With high penetration rates (75\% and above), traffic no longer becomes congested at the sag. Moreover, the results show that TSA-ACC and C-ACC reduce congestion more than B-ACC, mainly because they increase the queue discharge capacity of the sag. The two advanced ACC systems prevent the formation of congestion at the sag at lower penetration rates than B-ACC. TSA-ACC is the most effective system. C-ACC is only more effective than B-ACC in scenarios with 20\% penetration rate or higher; below that, connectivity between equipped vehicles is too low. Our findings show the potential of using advanced ACC systems to mitigate congestion at sags and indicate some challenges of this traffic management approach.}

A novel solution methodology is developed which extends the classic Clarke and Wright algorithm to solve the HVDRP. The performance of the developed heuristic is benchmarked against two other heuristics, namely, the vehicle-driven routing heuristic and the drone-driven routing heuristic. A set of experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the developed heuristics and to illustrate the capability of the developed model in answering a wide variety of questions related to the planning of the vehicle-drone delivery system.}

Owing to the complexity of this kind of optimisation problem, a simulated annealing metaheuristic approach is employed. A scenario with four hours of traffic overflying the Spanish (structured, continental) airspace has been selected. Inputted traffic provides routes, Mach profiles (considered to be constant), and altitude profiles as in their flight plans. Probabilistic weather forecasts from an Ensemble Prediction System are employed. Solutions provide constant speed profiles that slightly differ from those in the flight plans. It is shown that the number of conflicts can be significantly reduced by slightly modifying flight plan speeds while not altering the routes, nor the altitudes, both selected by the airspace user. The impact of this resolution strategy in flight efficiency is also analyzed.}

First, we demonstrate that detrending brings advantages to traffic prediction, even when deep learning models are considered. Second, the proposed model strikes a delicate balance between model complexity and accuracy. In contrast to the existing models that view a sensor network as a weighted graph and use graph convolutional neural networks (GCNN) to model spatial dependency, we represent a sensor network as an image and propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) as the prediction model. The image is generated by the correlation coefficient between the flow series of sensors, which is different from other CNN based prediction approaches that convert the transportation network into an image by the spatial location of sensors or regions. Compared with the GCNN based model, the CNN based DeepTrend 2.0 can achieve much faster convergence during training, and it guarantees similar prediction quality. Test results indicate that the proposed light-weighted model is efficient and easy to transfer and deploy.}

In this study, taxis are assumed to be replaced with ride-sharing autonomous vehicles. To improve the probability of on-time arrival, the reliable path concept and collected travel time information are used to facilitate path finding for SATs, and the potential benefits are examined. Two simulation scenarios—one based on historical traffic information and the other based on real-time traffic information—are executed to evaluate the information’s usefulness in reliable path finding. In simulation results, reliable path scenarios showed a higher on-time arrival ratio than shortest path scenarios, in which the shortest path algorithm is used in path finding for SATs, and the historical information-based scenarios showed a higher on-time arrival ratio than the real-time information-based scenarios. A system-beneficial path finding method is proposed and is verified to be effective for mitigating road network congestion.}

That is, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no study that has evaluated how the distribution of responses associated with each question and behavioral model estimated from AMT survey data compares to survey data collected from a traditional platform for a travel behavior application. This paper fills an important gap in the literature by examining (1) whether the distributions of responses from AMT and Qualtrics (a traditional market research firm) respondents are statistically equivalent, and (2) whether itinerary choice models estimated from these two surveys are statistically equivalent? Results show that AMT and Qualtrics respondents reported similar air trip characteristics and were drawn from a similar geographic distribution, but they exhibited distinct sociodemographic characteristics. After controlling for different age distributions in the two datasets, we found that airline itinerary choice models estimated from the AMT and Qualtrics survey data produced similar results, with the key difference related to price sensitivities. Our study provides preliminary evidence on the viability of using AMT and similar online outsourcing platforms for air travel behavior studies.}

In the experiments, a conflicting area is naturally formulated in the center region due to the converged shortest routes, so the practical motion navigation strategies, as well as the conflict avoidance behaviors, can be explored and summarized. Besides, the symmetric experimental conditions of pedestrians, e.g., symmetric starting points, symmetric destination points, and symmetric surroundings, lay the foundation for further quantitative comparisons among participants. In the paper, the pedestrian trajectories are recognized, and the pedestrian dynamics are accordingly investigated from the perspective of macroscopic indexes, i.e., route length, route potential, travel time, velocity and time-series. It is found that the route length has a log-normal distribution, the route potential obeys the exponential distribution, and the travel time is normally distributed as well as the speed. Furthermore, a model evaluation based on the experimental results is performed, using four distribution indexes and two time series indexes in both space and time dimensions. We graded the simulated distribution indexes by applying a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test based method and the simulated time series indexes by a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) based method. We evaluated two models: the traditional social force model, the modified model with default parameters and with calibrated parameters. The evaluation results showed that the two models cannot well reproduce the six macroscopic indexes, which indicates that the models do not capture the route choice and conflict avoidance behaviors of pedestrians. Our study is expected to shed light on the pedestrian modeling. Specifically, it indicates that apart from classical indexes such as a fundamental diagram, more comprehensive indexes are needed to evaluate the pedestrian flow models.}

While a relatively great deal of attention has been paid by recent studies to modelling directional decision making, the ‘exit decision changing (or decision adaptation)’ phenomenon has been largely overlooked. Here, we quantitatively investigate (I) how important is to include a decision changing module in evacuation simulation models, and (II) whether decision changing is beneficial to evacuation processes. We propose and implement a parsimonious discrete-choice model of decision changing. The model embodies the most influential factors that make an evacuee revise and adapt their choice of exit. This includes the effects of ‘relative queue-size imbalance at exits’, ‘visibility of exits’, ‘social influence’ and ‘inertia (for maintaining initial decisions)’. Results showed that, the inclusion of the decision changing module made a very substantial difference in enhancing the accuracy of the simulation outputs. Simulating exit choices as one-off decisions strictly limited the degree of match that could be achieved between the simulated and experimental outputs (in terms of replicating the observed exit shares and evacuation times) (question I). Further analyses also revealed that an intermediate degree of decision changing is a strategy that most benefits the system. By contrast, the extreme decision-changing strategies (i.e. “no change” and “too many changes”) were found to be suboptimal. Also, while we have observed, in our other studies, that imitative (or the so-called herd-type) behaviour in ‘exit choices’ is invariably detrimental to evacuation systems, here, we observed that when it comes to ‘adapting exit choices’, a moderate degree of imitation (or follow-the-peer) tendency makes the system more efficient (question II).}

In this problem, we select delivery centers that are accessible for all customers and determine the optimal delivery route that minimizes the costs proportional to the distance traveled by the delivery vehicle, the delivery time, and costs.

Empowered by modern technologies (e.g., GPS devices and smartphone-based APPs), a new generation of free-floating bike-sharing systems has recently become popular. Usage data generated by such systems produce rich information. This study presents a model framework to explore the spatio-temporal usage patterns of free-floating shared bikes using the usage data.

A case study is discussed based on the usage data from Mobike, one of the largest operating bike-sharing systems in Shanghai (China). The daily usage dynamics is modeled using log-normal distributions. Random Forest is adopted to explore the impact of factors on the usage frequency in different districts. It is found that residential area, park & green area, and population size are the top three factors influencing the frequency. Particularly, usage near metro stations is delved using the hierarchical clustering method, resulting in three typical usage modes. Visualization analysis is demonstrated to understand the time-varying flow patterns and the spatial distribution of shared bikes. This study improves our understanding of the usage patterns of this emerging transport mode and provides insights for the promotion and dynamic deployment of the bike-sharing system in urban areas.}

abstract = {In this paper, a robust and efficient High-angle Spatial-Temporal Diagram Analysis (HASDA) model is built to reconstruct high-resolution vehicle trajectories from infrastructure traffic surveillance videos. A combined methodology was developed, comprising of scanline-based trajectory extraction and feature-matching coordinate transformation. A scanline-based trajectory extraction technique is introduced to separate vehicle strands from pavement background on the spatial-temporal diagram by considering color features, gradient features, and motion features. Particular cleaning algorithms for removing static object noises, shadows, and occlusions are also established. Feature-matching coordinate transformation converts the pixel coordinates to the real-world coordinates to generate the physical vehicle trajectory. To evaluate the algorithm, generated trajectory results were compared to the reconstructed version of the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset. 15-min NGSIM video was divided into a 5-min dataset for the calibration and the remaining 10-min data for evaluation. Model parameters calibrated based on the 5-min video data are then applied to the 10-min testing data. Two levels of performance measurements are considered to evaluate both trajectory-level and point-level results. A reference algorithm based on mainstream motion-based detection and tracking methods are used as a baseline algorithm. Based on the evaluation results, the proposed method shows promising trajectory detection results, that on average more than 90\% of vehicle trajectories are constructed by the proposed methods from the NGSIM videos. The HASDA model outperforms the reference algorithm and shows superior transferability in the training-testing experiment. Further work needs to be done to improve the algorithm performance against shadows and occlusions by incorporating more intelligent and advanced techniques.}

In this study, we perform a rigorous simulation-based analysis of an in-vehicle routing strategy that aims to achieve a user-equilibrium distribution in traffic. Novel features of the approach include: a mechanism based on forward propagation of individual vehicle decisions to anticipate future traffic dynamics; time-dependent prediction of route travel times with neural network-based link predictors; and a stochastic routing policy for in-vehicle decision-making based on predicted travel times. However, for an effective application of the approach, design choices need to be made regarding the accuracy of the link predictors, and some control settings. These choices may depend on the network size and structure. We investigate the impact of two important design aspects: sequentially using link-level predictors for route travel time estimation, and the control parameter values, on the equilibrium performance at the network-level. The results suggest functional scalability of the approach, in terms of the prediction model accuracy and routing performance. Overall, the work contributes to a qualitative and quantitative understanding of emergent performance from the given routing approach.}

abstract = {There have been plenty of segment-based real-time safety analyses for expressways or freeways. In these analyses, it was considered that the occurrence of a crash is because of segment conditions, including traffic and geometric. However, the movement of a vehicle is continuous from upstream to downstream. Thus, the crash occurrence of a vehicle might also be because of the traffic conditions along its trajectory. Under this idea, the study on the quasi-vehicle-trajectory-based real-time safety for expressways is proposed. It is hard to directly obtain the trajectory data of the vehicle involved in a crash. Thus, the crash-related vehicle’s trajectory is derived from other traffic data sources, and it is called quasi-trajectory. To find vehicles’ quasi-trajectories, the exact crash time was first identified by observing significant speed drops, and then, the vehicle locations for every one minute was distinguished by using the data from HERE, which provides space-mean speed information. The traffic information along the quasi-trajectories is from the Microwave Vehicle Detection System. A Bayesian matched-case-control logistic regression model was built to explore the impact of traffic parameters along the vehicle quasi-trajectory on real-time crash risk. The results showed that the segment speed difference and segment volume difference along the vehicle quasi-trajectory in the 0–4 min interval before crash occurrence all had a significant positive impact on crash risk. Meanwhile, the truck volume difference and average segment speed in the 0–1 min interval before crashes also have a positive impact on real-time crash likelihood. This study is new in real-time safety analysis and the findings have the potential to be applied to improve the safety of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV). A CAV continuously collects the traffic information along with its trajectory and could calculate the crash risk. When the hazardous traffic condition happens, actions can be taken by CAV to prevent the crash occurrence.}

Big GPS trajectory data analytics offers new opportunities for gaining insights into vehicle movement dynamics and road network usage patterns that are important for transportation studies and urban planning among other fields. Processing big GPS trajectory data, consisting of billions of GPS waypoints and millions of individual trajectories is a challenging yet important task for researchers from these different domains. In this research, we propose an Apache Spark-based geo-computing framework for using big GPS trajectory data to estimate vehicle miles travelled, an important metric used by both federal and state highway agencies in the United States for transportation planning. The computing challenge lies in scaling the processing of billions of raw GPS points data as well as the steps for map matching for a statewide road network consisting of thousands of road segments. In this work, we develop a scalable map-matching module that considers both the spatiotemporal information of GPS waypoint sequences and topologic information of road network for the State of Maryland while striking a balance between matching accuracy and computing time. We processed 19.8 million raw GPS trips consisting of approximately 1.4 billion GPS waypoints collected in Maryland during a four-month period in 2015 to estimate vehicle miles travelled for Maryland’s road network. The estimation results show that using big GPS trajectory analytic methods is promising for obtaining accurate and stable vehicle miles travelled estimates.}

One of the important parameters affecting punctuality is the average boarding/alighting time. Organizing boarding/alighting flows not only reduces the risk of extended dwell time, but also minimizes the risk of injuries and improves the overall service quality. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of minimizing the boarding/alighting time by maintaining a uniform load on carriages through systematic distribution of passengers with flexible tickets, such as season or anytime tickets where no seat information are provided at the time of reservation. To achieve this, the proposed algorithm takes other information such as passenger final destination, uniform load of luggage areas, as well as group travelers into account. Moreover, a discrete event simulation is designed for measuring the performance of the proposed method. The performance of the proposed method is compared with three algorithms on different test scenarios. The results show the superiority of the proposed method in terms of minimizing boarding/alighting time as well as increasing the success rate of assigning group of seats to group of passengers.}

Autonomous intersection management (AIM) is tailored for CAVs aiming at replacing the conventional traffic control strategies. In this work, using the communication and computation technologies of CAVs, the sequential movements of vehicles through intersections are modelled as multi-agent Markov decision processes (MAMDPs) in which vehicle agents cooperate to minimize intersection delay with collision-free constraints. To handle the huge dimension scale incurred by the nature of multi-agent decision making problems, the state space of CAVs are decomposed into independent part and coordinated part by exploiting the structural properties of the AIM problem, and a decentralized coordination multi-agent learning approach (DCL-AIM) is proposed to solve the problem efficiently by exploiting both global and localized agent coordination needs in AIM. The main feature of the proposed approach is to explicitly identify and dynamically adapt agent coordination needs during the learning process so that the curse of dimensionality and environment nonstationarity problems in multi-agent learning can be alleviated. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated under a variety of traffic conditions. The comparison analysis is performed between DCL-AIM and the First-Come-First-Serve based AIM (FCFS-AIM), with Longest-Queue-First (LQF-AIM) policy and the signal control based on the Webster’s method (Signal) as benchmarks. Experimental results show that the sequential decisions from DCL-AIM outperform the other control policies.}

abstract = {This study develops bivariate extreme value models to integrate traffic conflict indicators for crash estimation. Based on video data collected from four sites of two signalized intersections, the automated traffic conflict analysis system was used to extract the TTC and PET between left-turn vehicles and through vehicles. Bivariate Generalized Extreme Value (BGEV) and Bivariate Generalized Pareto (BGP) models that jointly used the two conflict indicators were then developed, and the number of crashes were derived from the estimated model parameters. Univariate Generalized Extreme Value (UGEV) and Univariate Generalized Pareto (UGP) models were also applied using individual conflict indicators. The developed bivariate models and univariate models were evaluated by comparing model estimated crashes to observed left-turn crashes. The results show that the BGP model performed the best, followed by the BGEV model, UGP model, and UGEV model. It is found that crash estimates from univariate models based on PET and TTC are underestimated and overestimated, respectively. The bivariate models integrating the two indicators improve the crash estimation accuracy and precision. The BGP model outperforming the BGEV model is likely due to the former allowing more efficient use of the collected data. Overall, it is concluded that the bivariate extreme value modeling approach that is capable of integrating traffic conflict indicators with clear boundaries between traffic conflicts and crashes is more promising for crash estimation. Moreover, with the emerging automated traffic conflict analysis and connected vehicle techniques that facilitate the indicators extraction, the bivariate approach can be readily applied to provide accurate crash estimations for proactive road safety analysis.}

As it is difficult to anticipate the changing AV market conditions in the future, we take into account the uncertainty in AV purchase price. For the AV-IPD problem, we firstly decide which regular lanes should be converted into exclusive AV lanes. Secondly, we determine the AV purchase subsidy for each realization of AV purchase price with a given AV lane deployment scheme. A binary logit model is applied to characterize the vehicle choice behavior of users. The AV-IPD problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming model with equilibrium constraints. To solve the AV-IPD problem, we develop a solution method based on linear approximation techniques and duality theories.

abstract = {With ongoing massive investment in the field of autonomous vehicles, fully autonomous self-driving vehicles are set to become a reality soon. Despite the benefits in traffic safety and economy, the potential effects of autonomous vehicles, especially autonomous trucks, on transportation infrastructure remain to be determined. In this study, a finite element model was developed based on a typical flexible pavement structure. The effects of autonomous trucks’ lateral distribution within the lane with respect to rutting depth and fatigue damage were estimated by finite element analysis under certain environmental condition. Characteristics of the pavement structure and environmental condition have been collected and presented in this paper. Four possible lateral control modes on managing autonomous trucks’ lateral distribution were proposed, listed as zero-wander mode, uniform mode, double peak Gaussian mode, two-section uniform mode. Considering the difference between autonomous trucks and human-driven trucks, the ratio of autonomous trucks was also evaluated. Based on the simulation results, it has been confirmed that, if controlled appropriately, autonomous trucks could be highly beneficial to asphalt pavements for wider using of pavement. Conversely, if without appropriate lateral control, the effect of autonomous trucks on the typical flexible pavement life could be negative, owing to repeated single point load caused by lane centering and keeping. For example, the uniform mode, double peak Gaussian mode and two-section uniform mode all throw positive effect on the pavement. On the contrary, under the zero wander mode, the time when the rutting depth of the proposed pavement reaches 15 mm (defined as maintenance year) may advance by 1.56 years and fatigue damage at the bottom of asphalt layer increases by 146\%. Compared with the normal situation nowadays, the two-section uniform distribution of autonomous trucks, the best performing control mode, delays the maintenance year by 2.3 years. From the aspect of fatigue, a much uniform distribution curve of fatigue within the lane can also be found under this mode. When all trucks’ lateral positions were in control, the two-section uniform mode could reduce the fatigue damage by up to 35\% under repeated standard axle load on the flexible pavement. Finally, a framework of dealing with the lateral control was proposed as a reference for different conditions, such as asphalt pavement structures and materials.}

With the CLL design, one or multiple left-turn lanes are setup in the opposing through lanes adjacent to the median. The basic idea of the CLL design is to provide additional capacity to left-turning vehicles by making use of the opposing through lanes. The primary objective of the present study was to propose an actuated signal control strategy to improve the operations of the CLL design at signalized intersections. The proposed control strategy introduced an extra stage between the pre-signal and the main signal at the signalized intersection with the CLL design. Two detectors were installed: one at the upstream median opening and the other at the contraflow lane. A procedure was proposed for optimizing the distance between the upstream median opening and the main signal, such that the discharge rate of the left-turning vehicles and the utilization rate of the contraflow lane can be maximized. Simulation experiments were conducted to compare the performance of the proposed actuated control strategy versus the fixed time control strategy. The results show that the proposed design concept outperforms the fixed time control strategy in increasing capacity and reducing delay for left-turning vehicles.}

Yet, empirical studies on the behavioural characteristics of social-group evacuees, particularly those related to their decision-making mechanism, are relatively underrepresented. This study reports on a lab-in-the-field experiment of evacuations that investigates the effect of group size and stress level on multiple aspects of groups’ behaviour. These aspects include pre-movement time, decision time (i.e. time taken to reach a directional exit decision), exit-choice behaviour, exit-choice changing and intra-group decision dynamics. Our main findings showed that:(I)Group size had a significant effect on pre-movement times and decision times (and to lesser extent, on evacuation times). People took longer to initiate their movement or to make a directional exit decision when in groups compared to when acting alone. The influence of group size on pre-movement and decision times, however, was not monotonic. For smaller group sizes (sizes 2 and 3), pre-movement and decision times increased with the group size. But for the larger group size (size 4), the effect was reversed.(II)The exit-choice mechanism of groups, overall, showed a great degree of similarity to that of single individuals. This suggests that, from a modelling perspective, the directional exit choices of groups could be approximated with the models obtained from datasets of individually-made choices.(III)Groups were more likely to revisit and change their initial exit decisions under the higher level of stress. In addition, social influence was a major factor in triggering changes in the exit choices of groups. Nearly 50\% of the changes in group decisions occurred shortly after another neighbour group changed its exit decision. In other words, instances of group decision-changing was often followed by another group taking a similar action.(IV)As to the within-group dynamics of decision-making, our analyses suggested that, regardless of the group size, leadership was the dominant group decision-making mechanism (compared to the consensus or the conform-to-majority mechanisms). In nearly 50\% of the cases, group decisions were made by one individual taking the lead and hinting the direction of the movement to other members of the group.}

Different from the popular linear-matrix-inequality (LMI) robust control and model predictive control (MPC), this paper proposes a barrier-function-based distributed adaptive backstepping control scheme. The third-order nonlinear vehicle models are considered, uncertain parameters are identified on-line, full-state constraints are not violated, and the tracking control objectives are established.

abstract = {Mobility systems featuring shared vehicles are often unable to serve all potential customers, as the distribution of demand does not coincide with the positions of vehicles at any given time. System operators often choose to reposition these shared vehicles (such as bikes, cars, or scooters) actively during the course of the day to improve service rate. They face a complex dynamic optimization problem in which many integer-valued decisions must be made, using real-time state and forecast information, and within the tight computation time constraints inherent to real-time decision-making. We first present a novel nested-flow formulation of the problem, and demonstrate that its linear relaxation is significantly tighter than one from existing literature. We then adapt a two-stage stochastic approximation scheme from the generic SPAR algorithm due to Powell et al., in which rebalancing plans are optimized against a value function representing the expected cost (in terms of fulfilled and unfulfilled customer demand) of the future evolution of the system. The true value function is approximated by a separable function of contributions due to the rebalancing actions carried out at each station and each time step of the planning horizon. The new algorithm requires surprisingly few iterations to yield high-quality solutions, and is suited to real-time use as it can be terminated early if required. We provide insight into this good performance by examining the mathematical properties of our new flow formulation, and perform rigorous tests on standardized benchmark networks to explore the effect of system size. We then use data from Philadelphia’s public bike sharing scheme to demonstrate that the approach also yields performance gains for real systems.}

abstract = {This study examines the predictability of a truckload trucker’s whereabouts, using a GPS trajectory data set from about 1000 active users of an on-line freight exchange (OFEX) platform. To describe a trucker’s whereabouts, two different location mapping schemes are proposed. The first divides the entire study area into rectangular grids using a simple geographic rescaling method and treats each grid as a unique location. In the second scheme, a location type (LT) is first assigned to each GPS point, using Point Of Interest (POI) information. Then, each GPS trajectory is converted to a trajectory of LT data. We then process both types of trajectory data, grid-based and type-based, to develop various entropy and predictability measures. We find that the whereabouts of truckers possess strong regularity, but are substantially more difficult to predict than that of an average person. Specifically, the predictability of truckers’ next location on the grid map peaks at 83\%, about 10\% percentage point lower than that reported in the literature. Surprisingly, predicting the type of the location that a typical trucker may visit the next is even more difficult, with a predictability around 81\%. Findings from this study could help guide the development of algorithms for predicting truckers’ next visit location and the type of the location.}

A fleet of supply vessels delivers all the necessary equipment and materials to a set of offshore installations from an onshore supply base, according to a delivery schedule or sailing plan. Supply vessels, being the major cost contributor, are chartered on a long-term basis. The planning of supply vessels implies resolving the trade-off between the cost of the delivery schedule and the reliability of deliveries on the scheduled voyages, i.e. the service level. The execution of a sailing plan is affected by stochastic demands at the installations since a high demand fluctuation quite often leads to insufficient vessel capacity to perform a voyage according to the sailing plan. In addition, the average demand level at the installations may change over time, while the number of vessels in the sailing plan remains the same. Maintaining a reliable flow of supplies under stochastic demand therefore leads to additional costs and reduced service level. We present a novel methodology for reliable supply vessel planning and scheduling, enabling planners to construct delivery schedules having a low expected total cost. The methodology involves the construction of delivery schedules with different reliability levels using an adaptive large neighborhood search metaheuristic algorithm combined with a discrete event simulation procedure for the computation of the expected solution cost.}

The problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear program thus, does not scale well with the size of the network in a centralized optimization framework due to the presence of many mixed integer decision variables and nonlinear constraints. To address this limitation, we will develop a distributed model predictive control that distributes the network-level cooperative problem into several intersection-level sub-problems and coordinates their decisions. Our numerical analyses show that the proposed distributed methodology finds solutions to the problem in real-time with the optimality gap of at most 3.6\% in our case studies. We have implemented the distributed methodology in Vissim and observed that cooperative signal timing and perimeter control yielded significant improvements in traffic operations. Our case study results show that the cooperative approach increases the number of completed trips by 6.0–12.8\% and 10.9–11.0\% and reduces the total travel times by 8.1–9.0\% and 23.6–24.2\% compared to independent signal control and independent perimeter control, respectively.}

A random parameter multinomial logistic regression model was used to reflect the relationships between drivers’ deceleration and acceleration and the geometric alignments of a mountainous freeway. Vehicle speed was treated as a random slope parameter to account for the heterogeneity among subjects. Model results showed deceleration and acceleration were significantly influenced by the fixed effects of maximum curvature in the following 50 m, difference between maximum and minimum slope in the preceding 100 m, maximum slope change in the following 400 m, and maximum curvature in the preceding 50 m.

Bicycling research and commercial travel applications typically use digital elevation models to estimate road grades. The goal of this research is to determine the best methods of obtaining road grade data for bicycle travel analysis on an urban street network. Multiple elevation data sources are collected for eight sample locations in the city of Vancouver, Canada. Road grade extraction algorithms are applied and compared to precise ground surveying data. Estimates of cycling power and energy are used to assess the road grade accuracy in a specific analytical context. Road grades on all 35 elevated roadways of at least 30 m in the city are also characterized and classified into 3 modalities of road grade distribution. Results show that road elevations and grades extracted from raw Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data are the most accurate where directly measured grades are unavailable. Interpolation of digital elevation models (DEM) and digital surface models (DSM) can provide adequate grade estimates on non-elevated roads, but are highly inaccurate on elevated structures, leading to substantial errors in cycling power and energy estimates. Short elevated network links (under 100 m) often have unimodal grade distributions which can be approximated with straight-line elevation profiles, but longer elevated structures (such as arched spans) have more grade variability. Recommendations are made for estimating grades on a network with and without LIDAR data, with the caveat that propagation of errors in grade data should be considered in walking and cycling analysis.}

Data synthesis In this paper, we quantitatively measure the risk of privacy disclosure in mobility trace data set caused by re-identification attacks based on the concept of k-anonymity. Using a one-month license plate recognition (LPR) data set collected in Guangzhou, China, we examine a variety of factors determining the degree of anonymity of an individual, including the temporal granularity and the size of the published data, local v.s. non-local vehicles, and continuous v.s. non-continuous observations. We find that five spatiotemporal records are enough to uniquely identify about 90\% of individuals, even when the temporal granularity is set to be half a day. To publish LPR data without compromising privacy, we propose a suppression solution and a generalization solution and quantify the privacy-and-utility trade-off of them. Our results show that the suppression solution, which removes sensitive records, have a notable performance on privacy protection. The average individual anonymity identified by three spatiotemporal records increases by more than 20\% at the cost of losing less than 8\% of the data. We also propose a bintree-based adaptive time interval cloaking algorithm as a generalization solution. To meet a specific anonymity constraint, this algorithm adjusts the temporal resolution adaptively based on traffic counts under the principle of minimal information loss. We find that the generalization algorithm performs extremely well in satisfying different user-specified anonymity constraints and it is more flexible and reliable than the traditional uniform time interval cloaking method. We also find a strong correlation between the resulting temporal accuracy of data anonymized by the algorithm and the traffic condition. This study serves as a reminder to relevant agencies and data owners about the privacy vulnerability in individual-based mobility trace data sets and provides methodological guidance when publishing and sharing such sensitive data set.}

The results of the modeling indicate: (1) the spatial weight matrix is unstable over time-of-day, while the network weight matrix is robust in all cases and (2) the performance of the network weight matrix in non-rush hour traffic regimes is significantly better than rush hour traffic regimes. The results of the validation show the network weight matrix outperforms the traditional way of capturing spatial dependency between traffic links. Averaging over all traffic links and time, this superiority is about 13.2\% in rush hour and 15.3\% in non-rush hour, when only the first-order neighboring links are embedded in modeling. In addition, this study proposes a two-step algorithm to search and identify the best look-back time window for upstream links. We indicate the best look-back time window depends on the travel time between two study detectors, and it varies by time-of-day and traffic link.}

Therefore, imputing missing values is of great importance but challenging as it is not easy to capture spatiotemporal traffic patterns, including explicit and latent features. In this study, we propose an augmented tensor factorization model by incorporating generic forms of domain knowledge from transportation systems. Specifically, we present a fully Bayesian framework for automatically learning parameters of this model using variational Bayes (VB). Relying on the publicly available urban traffic speed data set collected in Guangzhou, China, experiments on two types of missing data scenarios (i.e., random and non-random) demonstrate that the proposed Bayesian augmented tensor factorization (BATF) model achieves best imputation accuracies and outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., Bayesian tensor factorization models). Besides, we discover interpretable patterns from the experimentally learned global parameter, biases, and latent factors that indeed conform to the dynamic of traffic states.}

A temporal-spatial dimension extension-based trajectory coordination model is developed by formulating all possible trajectories of vehicles at the intersection. Correspondingly, according to the trajectory coordination model, two signal-free control algorithms, including the priority-based algorithm and the Discrete Forward-Rolling Optimal Control (DFROC) algorithm are proposed in this study to manage vehicles at the intersection. These two algorithms, together with the FCFS policy, are compared with the conventional signal control method in a SUMO-based simulation platform. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithms outperform the signal control method in terms of reducing total traffic delays at intersections and increasing intersection capacity and operation efficiency.}

A number of studies on traffic state estimation fusing several sensing data have been reported. Most of the studies use data from traffic detectors installed at fixed locations and data from moving objects such as probe vehicles. Traffic detectors provide valuable volume information of all running vehicles which cannot be observed from sample moving objects. However, in local areas in Japan as well as in Asian cities, detector installations are very much limited like one in every 10 to 15 km on a motorway in our country. This study therefore attempts to utilize measurements from a vehicle running on the opposite lane instead of detector measurements, since a vehicle on the opposite lane running backward can in principle measure counts of passing vehicles running forward. In this study, we employ the variational theory to estimate the traffic states utilizing the count measurement from the opposite lane in addition to probe vehicle data on the forward direction and examine the sensitivity of the estimates in relation to variabilities of the input data and measurements. The validation finds that the proposed method can estimate traffic states more accurately than one using only probe vehicle data. Especially, this method has the advantage in quickly responding unexpected incidences such as accidents and vehicle malfunctions.}

Managing such a complex multi-modal system requires a holistic modeling framework of transportation network flow in terms of both passenger flow and vehicular flow. In this paper, we formulate and solve for spatio-temporal passenger and vehicular flows in a general multi-modal network explicitly considering multi-class vehicles, parking facilities, and various travel modes. Vehicular flows, namely cars, trucks, and buses, are integrated into a holistic dynamic network loading (DNL) model. Travel behavior of passenger demand on modes and routes choices is encapsulated by a multi-layer nested logit model. We formulate the multi-modal dynamic user equilibrium (MMDUE) that can be cast into a Variational Inequality (VI) problem. A simple flow solution performed at the origin-destination level and based on the gradient projection is derived from the KKT conditions and shown to efficiently solve for the VI problem on large-scale networks. Numerical experiments are conducted on a multi-modal network in the Pittsburgh region along with sensitivity analysis with respect to demand and management strategies. We show that many factors including the total passenger demand, parking prices, transit fare, and ride-sharing impedance can effectively impact the system performance and individual user costs. Experiments on a large-scale multi-modal network in Fresno, California also show our model and solution algorithm have satisfactory convergence performance and computational efficiency.}

They can also safely operate in multi-vehicle strings while keeping shorter than normal gaps among adjacent vehicles in the high-speed traffic stream. Such capabilities can greatly benefit the management of urban signalized intersections. In this study, we have developed a cooperative signal control algorithm that adopts the CACC datasets and the datasets collected by the traditional fixed traffic sensors to predict the future traffic conditions. The prediction allows the signal controller to assign signal priority to the intersection approach that accommodates the most CACC strings. Such a control strategy can significantly enhance the CACC string operation, which ultimately improves the overall intersection performance. The effectiveness of the algorithm has been tested in a simulated 4-way signalized intersection. The algorithm substantially outperforms the traditional actuated controller as it perceives the traffic flow more comprehensively and assigns the green time resource more efficiently than the traditional controller. Particularly, the average vehicle speed and the average vehicle miles travelled per gallon fuel consumed (MPG) can be increased by more than 10\% when the CACC market penetration is 100\%. In mixed traffic where CACC fleets frequently interact with manually driven vehicles, the algorithm is found to be more beneficial. The speed and MPG improvement exceed 30\% when the CACC market penetration is 40\%. The signal control algorithm can bring about significant benefit even when the CACC market penetration is 0\%. In this case, it completely relies on the datasets obtained from the traditional traffic sensors. This finding demonstrates the robustness of the algorithm. It makes the proposed algorithm suitable to implement in real-world intersections under various CACC market penetrations and different levels of vehicle connectivity.}

Traffic SA is applied as the basis to derive the analytical expression of individual vehicle trajectory given the fundamental diagram (FD) parameters (e.g., capacity, jam density, free flow speed) as well as the traffic volume. According to SA, the analytical probability distribution of each vehicle’s travel time (defined as the time of a vehicle travelling between an upstream and a downstream location at a signalized intersection) is derived. This probability distribution is parameterized by traffic volume and FD parameters. We then apply a three-layer BN model to construct the relationship between traffic volume, FD parameters, sampled vehicles’ arrival times and intersection travel times. Since traffic volume cannot be measured directly from sampled vehicle trajectories, an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is introduced to perform learning for estimating the cycle-by-cycle volume (or arrivals) and FD parameters. Such estimated parameters are then used, via SA, to estimate vehicles’ intersection travel times. The proposed combined SA-BN model is evaluated using microscopic traffic simulation data and the NGSIM dataset. Sensitivity analysis of the estimation performance with respect to penetration rates is conducted. In general, the proposed method yields promising estimation accuracy, with the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the estimation bounded by 15\%, generally around 5\%, as compared with the true value, even under low penetration rates.}

The new approach is intended to replace the pencil-and-paper travel diaries and prompted recall methods that require more user involvement due to requirements for manual data entry and/or high battery usage. Reducing the burden placed on users enables researchers to collect data over longer periods, thus improving the quality of travel behavior research. To reduce battery use the smartphone-based application collects GPS data less frequently than other methods. Therefore, new algorithms were developed to identify trips and activities, transport mode, and even the specific vehicle used by the traveler. An important finding was the significant advantage of using users’ past data to improve mode detection results. The system was tested successfully in Zürich and Basel (Switzerland).}

In this paper, a work-efficient, Multiple Source Shortest Path (MSSP) implementation of the Bellman-Ford algorithm is proposed to dramatically increase the performance of shortest path calculations for low-density high-diameter graphs, which are characteristic of transportation networks. This is achieved through the use of an Origin-Vertex Frontier to increase the level of parallelism within the shortest path algorithm for multiple source vertices in low-density graphs, when executed on GPUs. The algorithm is implemented within the SATURN transport simulation software and benchmarked on a range of real-world transportation networks. Our algorithm improves hardware utilisation of massively-parallel GPUs; demonstrating performance improvements of up to 7.8x over a multi-core CPU (Central Processing Unit) implementation.}

This study developed an automatic extraction algorithm to retrieve 5339 lane change events from the Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study, and used the data to examine the core lane change components: gap acceptance, duration, and impact on the following vehicle (FV). Multilevel mixed-effects linear models were employed to develop relationships between gap acceptance and duration and the influencing factors; impact was then assessed using speed change rate, brake timestamping, and time-to-collision (TTC). Key results showed that (1) gap acceptance varied by roadway type and motivation, and lead and lag gaps were significantly affected by environmental variables, vehicle type, and kinematic parameters; (2) duration varied from 0.7 s to 16.1 s, significantly affected by variables similar to gap acceptance, but notably, not by motivation; (3) as many as 1 in 5 Chinese FV drivers responded to lane changes with acceleration exceeding 10\%; (4) nearly half of FVs braked when they perceived a vehicle’s lane-change intention, and 90\% braked before TTC reached 4.7 s; (5) in over 70\% of lane changes, the minimum TTC occurred between the initiation and cross-lane points. In addition to advancing the international development of lane-change theory, one of this study’s important applications is that CAVs can be designed to brake during a safer TTC phase.}

The model uses a novel link cost function that retains all microscopic transient behavior along a link by capturing within-link speed, acceleration, and road grade variations. Specifically, eight vehicle-agnostic link-specific variables are transmitted to the cloud and fused with information received from other connected vehicles. The fused data are then sent back to the connected vehicles and used to compute vehicle-specific eco-routes (edge computing). The solution produces an energy-efficient dynamic user-equilibrium traffic assignment that is solved incrementally. A numerical experiment is first designed to test the model, demonstrating the benefits associated with vehicle-specific eco-routes compared to those produced by traditional models. The model is then implemented in a micro-simulation framework to evaluate the network-wide impacts of the proposed energy-efficient user-optimum incremental traffic assignment for different traffic demand levels. Results demonstrate that the proposed model produces lower network-wide energy consumption levels compared to traditional energy-efficient and travel time user-optimum traffic assignment methods for both conventional fuel and electric vehicles. Conventional fuel savings relative to travel time routing decrease with increasing traffic demand levels, while electric power savings do not vary monotonically with congestion levels. Energy savings relative to traditional eco-routing are also demonstrated to not vary monotonically with demand levels. Results of the study also demonstrate that the transportation network layout significantly affects the eco-routing system performance. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed model in real-world applications is discussed and presented.}

abstract = {Couriers undertaking deliveries in Central Business Districts (CBDs) often have difficulty conducting efficient routes due to the uncertainty associated with the availability of loading zones. Delivery routes for courier vehicles operating in central city areas involve a combination of driving and walking paths for delivering goods to multiple receivers. Sensor technologies are becoming available that can provide real time information regarding the availability and occupancy of loading zones. Utilization of occupancy information can reduce transport costs for couriers as well as emissions and congestion levels within CBDs. Booking systems allow loading zones to be reserved for delivery vehicles. This paper describes an agent-based simulation model combined with optimization procedures developed to predict the behavior of courier drivers in CBDs. The model, which allows couriers routes to be optimized based on minimizing both driving and walking costs, was applied to study the effects for introducing a loading zone occupancy information as well as estimate the potential limitations compared to a reservation system. The consequences of permitting waiting at loading zones as well as duration limits are predicted. Lower driving times were estimated when real time availability and average occupancy information of loading zones were provided when no waiting was permitted. This was found to be more pronounced when there were no duration limits at loading zones. However, when waiting at loading zones was permitted, only marginal driving time savings were predicted when real time availability and average occupancy information were provided. Despite that, compared to the case when an ideal reservation system was employed for couriers to conduct the best possible delivery plan, the information systems still had opportunities for further enhancements in driving times in periods of high demand, although only marginal savings in driving times could be made when waiting at loading zones was allowed.}

The resulting large MPC optimization problem containing both continuous and discrete decision variables is solved using Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition to improve the scalability of the proposed approach. At a lower level, the optimal short-term scheduling of the maintenance interventions suggested by the high-level controller and the optimal routing of the corresponding maintenance crew is formulated as a capacitated arc routing problem, which is solved exactly by transforming it into a node routing problem. The proposed approach is illustrated by a numerical case study on the optimal treatment of squats of a regional Dutch railway network. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is robust, non-conservative, and scalable.}

Since their primary purposes are often non-transportation related, passively-generated data need to be processed to extract trips. Most existing trip extraction methods rely on data that are generated via a single positioning technology such as GPS or triangulation through cellular towers (thereby called single-sourced data). Methods to extract trips from data generated via multiple positioning technologies (called “multi-sourced data”) are absent. And yet, multi-sourced data are increasingly common. Generated using multiple technologies (e.g., GPS, cellular network- and WiFi-based), multi-sourced data contain high variances in their temporal and spatial properties. In this study, we propose a “Divide, Conquer and Integrate” (DCI) framework to extract trips from multi-sourced data. We evaluate the proposed framework by applying it to an app-based data, which is multi-sourced and has high variances in both location accuracy and observation interval (i.e. time interval between two consecutive observations). On a manually labeled sample of the app-based data, the framework outperforms the state-of-the-art SVM model that is designed for GPS data. The effectiveness of the framework is also illustrated by consistent mobility patterns obtained from the app-based data and an externally collected household travel survey data for the same region and the same period.}

abstract = {By conducting a cross-sectional survey at Deutsche Post, a major German postal delivery service provider, we examine to what extent commercial drivers accept the substitution of conventional cars with light-duty e-vehicles (LDEVs). Specifically, we explore drivers’ acceptance from two perspectives. First, we investigate drivers’ perceived satisfaction with LDEVs compared to conventional vehicles. Second, we question whether electric cars in general increase drivers’ perceived efficiency of them. Combining these two perspectives, we show that the greater the drivers’ overall perceived satisfaction with LDEVs is, the higher is the drivers’ perceived efficiency of LDEVs. We prove this by means of perceived usefulness (perceived relative advantage) and perceived ease of use (the opposite of perceived complexity) of LDEVs, using adaptations of Davis’ Technology Acceptance Model and Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovations Theory to form our Unified Technology Acceptance Model (UTAM). Our findings suggest that, on average, drivers are slightly more satisfied with the LDEVs than with the available conventional cars (n = 66). If drivers were able to choose their preferred vehicles, the majority of them would favor LDEVs. We detect statistically significant patterns of latent measures affecting perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of LDEVs. Although this paper focuses on German delivery service employees, the methodology presented here could easily be applied to any other enterprise in the growing logistics segment which plans to electrify its car fleet. Hence, our contributions are valuable for transportation research and, more specifically, to all potential commercial EV drivers, e.g., our insights might be relevant for the approx. 500,400 drivers employed in the German logistics sector alone.}

The proposed Arterial Cell Transmission Model (ACTM) has been thoroughly tested with synthetic data and further validated using real data. Compared with the CTM, the proposed ACTM improves the back of the queue estimation accuracy by 20\%−80\%. The ACTM offers a more realistic simulation of densities on each lane in case of blockages or spillbacks from short turning lanes and models the interaction among movements in shared lanes including gap acceptance behaviour of permitted turns from shared lanes that are opposed by through traffic. The extension also enables the balancing of unequal lane utilisation whenever required.

In the presence of limited airspace capacity as well as the saturated airway network, it is no longer practicable to mitigate air traffic congestion by adding new airways/links. In this paper, we provide a “counter-intuitive” perspective towards air traffic congestion mitigation by removing airways/links from a given airway network. We draw inspiration from Braess’s Paradox which suggests that adding extra links to a congested traffic network could make the traffic more congested. The paper explores whether Braess’s Paradox occurs in airway networks, or more specifically, whether it is possible to better distribute the flow in an airway network by merely removing some of its airways/links. In this paper, We develop a method for Braess’s Paradox detection in any given airway network. To validate the efficacy of the method, a case study is conducted for the South-East Asia airspace covering Singapore airway network, by using 6 months of ADS-B data. The results show that Braess’s Paradox does occur in airway networks and the proposed method can successfully identify the airway network links that may cause it. The results also demonstrate that, upon removing such links, the total travel time for a given day traffic at a given flight level, was reduced from 8661.15 min to 8328.64 min, a reduction of 332.5 min. This amounts to a saving of 3.8\% in travel time.}

Truck platooning is such an application that relies on the development of Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) and is said to be practice ready. While the main advantages of truck platooning lie in emission and energy reduction, claims are also being made for the influence on traffic flow. In this paper, we pose hypotheses based on some of the main claims. We also attempt to substantiate and give quantitative proof of the potential effects of truck platooning on traffic flow performance. The simulation model LMRS-IDM+ is extended to encompass the main influencing dynamics related to potential effects of truck platooning, based on empirical findings. The effects of truck platooning were tested for the influence of traffic states, truck gap settings, platoon sizes, and the share of equipped trucks. This resulted in outcomes regarding the total traffic performance, the performance of traffic at ramps, and the ability of a platoon to remain platooning as part of a case experiment performed on a part of the Trans-European ITS Corridor. The results showed that truck platooning may have a small negative effect on the total non-saturated traffic flow, however with a much larger negative effect on saturated traffic flow. However, drivers may be reluctant to platoon in saturated traffic in any case. The ability of inflowing traffic to merge at on-ramps was found to be affected by truck platoons, with platoon disengagements occurring under various conditions. The applied gap settings for platooning trucks did not significantly affect the merge time, while a higher gap did lead to a higher number of disengagements. The ability of trucks to platoon was positively affected by a greater percentage of equipped trucks and by larger platoon sizes. Shorter gap times also slightly improved the ability of trucks to remain in platooning formation. Finally, recommendations are given to improve platoon strategies and for policymakers to only allow truck platooning outside of busy (near-) saturated traffic, even though drivers may be reluctant to use the system in these conditions. Also, recommendations are made to investigate potential differences in the effects between the European and American contexts for truck-platooning.}

First, we estimate a robust univariate speed threshold using historical traffic information from individual sensors. This step can be parallelized using MapReduce framework thereby making it feasible to implement the framework over large networks. Our study shows that such robust thresholds can improve incident detection performance significantly compared to traditional threshold determination. Second, we leverage the knowledge of the topology of the road network to construct threshold heatmaps and perform image denoising to obtain spatio-temporally denoised thresholds.

abstract = {The present study investigates how social influence and social interactions can affect the adoption of new technologies, using stated preference (SP) survey data combined with an “accelerated reality” experience of social interaction among the respondents. Specifically, the intention to use a pro-environmental transport mode (the bike sharing) during a public transport strike within a cohort of students has been analysed. Previous studies have modelled social influence effects using SP data by providing a hypothetical scenario with simulated interactions or information about social conformity processes (i.e. social adoption) during the survey. In our paper, in addition to the impact of assumed social norms, the effect of live/real social interactions is included in the survey. SP survey is developed to investigate the effect of Level-of-Service attributes on the hypothetical choices in the scenario of a public transport strike. Besides the pre-defined attributes characterising the alternatives in the SP design, the survey includes techniques to acquire information on conformity and social interactions. Specifically, the interviewees undertake a before and after stated preference experiment (SP1 and SP2), with a period of group discussion in between the two parts. This SP experiment involves different cognitive and interpersonal mechanisms, such as the functional information exchange on benefits and drawbacks of cycling and bike sharing. The aim is to establish whether hypothetical scenarios of social conformity are different from real/live social interactions and whether these social influence processes actually affect the individuals' mode choice. A joint SP1/SP2 mixed logit (ML) model has been estimated to explore the choice behaviour of individuals and allows us to incorporate the inertia/propensity to change behaviour between SP1 and SP2. Moreover, considering the “Reflexive Layers of Influence” (RLI) framework, the processes generated by social interactions (diffusion, translation and reflexivity) are measured and incorporated in the model. We finally show the effect of these social influence variables on the goodness-of-fit of the models and choice simulation for prediction. We also draw conclusions about the value of such enhanced choice models in understanding and predicting the impacts of social interactions on choice behaviour in the context of new transport technologies.}

This includes limited knowledge of demand characteristics (especially for pooled rides), travel modes being substituted, types of activities being accessed, as well as possible trip induction effects. The current study contributes to this knowledge gap by investigating ride-hailing experience, frequency, and trip characteristics through two multi-dimensional models estimated using data from the Dallas-Fort Worth Metropolitan Area. Ride-hailing adoption and usage are modeled as functions of unobserved lifestyle stochastic latent constructs, observed transportation-related choices, and sociodemographic variables. The results point to low residential location density and people’s privacy concerns as the main deterrents to pooled ride-hailing adoption, with non-Hispanic Whites being more privacy sensitive than individuals of other ethnicities. Further, our results suggest a need for policies that discourage the substitution of short-distance “walkable” trips by ride-hailing, and a need for low cost and well-integrated multi-modal systems to avoid substitution of transit trips by this mode.}

An integrated framework is proposed to assess single-vehicle traffic safety performance of stochastic traffic flow under hazardous driving conditions. Different from most existing studies focusing on a single vehicle moving at a constant speed, for the first time, the proposed work evaluates individual vehicle safety performance based on the time-dependent simulation results of stochastic traffic flow, including instantaneous speeds and positions of each vehicle as a part of simulated traffic flow. Simultaneously, complex geometric and other environmental conditions of the highway system are also considered realistically, not only during the safety assessment process, but also in quantifying the wind loads applied on the vehicles. Finally, with the safety information of each individual vehicle, an overall safety performance index of the whole traffic flow on the highway system is further introduced, which serves as a potential traffic safety performance measure and resilience indicator of transportation infrastructure systems under various hazards. This study has potential applications to not only regular vehicles, but also advanced traffic management and control algorithms for connected and autonomous vehicles in hazardous driving environments.}

The prediction horizon is defined by a number of downstream stops and subsequent buses. The predictions made include the arrival and departure times of vehicles at downstream stops and the passenger demands they are expected to serve. The model is demonstrated with a case study of three lines of the BRT system in Haifa, Israel. The results show that the model outperforms headway control and no-control alternatives in terms of total passengers’ time and on-time performance. It is only slightly worst then the headway control in terms of waiting times and denied boarding at stops.

Because of the limited driving range of these vehicles, intermediate stops at the Alternative Fuel Stations must also be considered. For the G-VRP, we propose two Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulations allowing multiple visits to the stations without introducing dummy copies of them. In the first model, only one visit to a station between two customers or between a customer and the depot is allowed. While, in the second model, two consecutive visits to stations are also permitted. In addition, the two formulations are strengthened through both dominance criteria to a priori identify the stations that are more efficient to use in each route and valid inequalities, specifically tailored for the G-VRP. Computational results, carried out on benchmark instances, show that our formulations strongly outperform the exact solution approaches presented in the literature. Finally, in order to better investigate the issue of the consecutive refueling stops, a new set of instances is properly generated and significant transport insights are also provided.}

This research explores the drivers of non-users’ willingness to use ride-sharing services from the perspectives of perceived value and perceived risk, where perceived value and perceived risk are both conceptualised as formative second-order constructs constituted by their first-order value components and risk components. The data was collected in China through an online questionnaire from 378 respondents who had never used a ride-sharing platform. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) is used to verify the research model and hypotheses. The empirical results reveal that perceived value is positively associated with consumer willingness to participate in ride-sharing, but perceived risk is negatively related to consumers’ ride-sharing intention. Contrary to expectations, perceived risk positively moderates the effect of perceived value on consumers’ ride-sharing intention. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the effects of consumers’ value perception and risk perception on their acceptance of internet-based ride-sharing services. Measures to promote ride-sharing include maximising consumers’ value of ride-sharing and their perception of value as well as reducing potential risks in ride-sharing process.}

Knowing arrival times of public vehicles in advance can reduce waiting times of passengers and attract more people to take public transport. Existing approaches have two main limitations in the field of bus travel time prediction. First, influenced by increasingly complex real-time traffic factors and sparsity of real-time data, bus travel times can be difficult to predict accurately in modern cities. Second, bus dwelling and transit times are predominantly affected by different factors and hence have different patterns, but little research focuses on how to divide dwelling and transit areas and to build independent models for them. Consequently, we propose a novel segment-based approach to predict bus travel times using a combination of real-time taxi and bus datasets, that can automatically divide bus routes into dwelling and transit segments. Two models are built to predict them separately by incorporating different impact traffic factors. We evaluate our approach using real-world trajectory datasets, collected in Xi’an, China during June 2017. Compared to existing methods, the experimental results reveal that our approach improves the accuracy of bus travel time prediction, especially under abnormal traffic conditions.}

This allows vehicles to engage in transactions where gaps in traffic are created in exchange for monetary compensation. The proposed approach is best suited to discretionary lane change maneuvers. We formulate gains in travel time, referred to as time differences, that result from achieving higher speeds. These time differences, coupled with value of time, are used to formulate a utility function, where utility is transferable. We also allow for games between connected vehicles that do not involve transfer of utility. We apply Nash bargaining theory to solve the latter. A cellular automaton is developed and utilized to perform simulation experiments that explore the impact of such transactions on traffic conditions (travel-time savings, resulting speed-density relations and shock wave formation) and the benefit to vehicles. The results show that lane changing with transferable utility between drivers can help achieve win-win results, improve both individual and social benefits without resulting in any adverse effects on traffic characteristics in general and, in fact, result in slight improvement at traffic densities outside of free-flow and (bumper-to-bumper) jammed traffic.}

In this study, we propose a unified framework to design, optimize and analyze MoD operations within a multimodal transportation system where the demand for a travel mode is a function of its level of service. An application of Bayesian optimization (BO) to derive the optimal supply-side MoD parameters (e.g., fleet size and fare) is also illustrated. The proposed framework is calibrated using the taxi demand data in Manhattan, New York. Travel demand is served by public transit and MoD services of varying passenger capacities (1, 4 and 10), and passengers are predicted to choose travel modes according to a mode choice model. This choice model is estimated using stated preference data collected in New York City. The convergence of the multimodal supply-demand system and the superiority of the BO-based optimization method over earlier approaches are established through numerical experiments. We finally consider a policy intervention where the government imposes a tax on the ride-hailing service and illustrate how the proposed framework can quantify the pros and cons of such policies for different stakeholders.}

However, most of the existing studies only model limited interactions of vehicle trajectories at the microscopic level, without considering the coordination between vehicle trajectories. This study proposes a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to cooperatively optimize the trajectories of CAVs along a corridor for system optimality. The car-following and lane-changing behaviors of each vehicle along the entire path are optimized together. The trajectories of all vehicles along the corridor are coordinated for system optimality in terms of total vehicle delay. All vehicle movements (i.e., left-turning, through, and right-turning) are considered at each intersection. The ingress lanes are not associated with any specific movement and can be used for all vehicle movements, which provides much more flexibility. Vehicles are controlled to pass through intersections without traffic signals. Due to varying traffic conditions, the planning horizon is adaptively adjusted in the implementation procedure of the proposed model to find a balance between solution feasibility and computational burden. Numerical studies validate the advantages of the proposed CAV-based control over the coordinated fixed-time control at different demand levels in terms of vehicle delay and throughput. The analyses of the safety time gaps for collision avoidance within intersection areas show the promising benefits of traffic management under the fully CAV environment.}

This paper is devoted to proposing robust scheduling strategies of electric buses to tackle the challenge brought by the stochasticity of urban traffic conditions. To avoid en-route breakdown of electric buses, reduce delay costs, and achieve robustness, we propose both static and dynamic scheduling models. The static model introduces a buffer-distance strategy to tackle the adverse impacts caused by trip time stochasticity, whereas the dynamic model takes advantage of continuously-updated road traffic conditions and periodically reschedules an electric bus fleet during a day’s operations. A branch-and-price framework is extended to effectively solve both models. Using the realistic operations data of bus lines in Beijing, we conduct numerical examples to simulate the performances of the proposed models and derive some important insights. As suggested by the numerical results, the proposed models can effectively avoid en-route breakdown, while maintaining cost efficiency.}

This paper, using the information provided by connected vehicles, proposes a novel control approach based on the concept of perimeter control to maximize the social welfare of all vehicles. The contributions of this paper are threefold. First, we consider vehicle heterogeneity (i.e. corresponding to different transportation modes, or with different occupancies, values of time, priority levels, etc.) and integrate a priority scheme into perimeter control to improve both the traffic performance and the social welfare. This is achieved by installing priority lanes at some of the perimeter intersections. Unlike the existing research works that provide priority to certain traffic modes, we dynamically identify the groups of vehicles that we should prioritize, in order to maximize the social welfare. Second, we develop a model predictive control approach to simultaneously optimize the toll for using the priority lanes and the traffic signal timings at the perimeter intersections. This approach can explicitly handle the constraint of the storage capacity of each intersection link. Third, we propose a recursive estimation algorithm to update our knowledge on the distribution of the value of times (VOTs), using the lane choice information of connected vehicles. The proposed approach is tested in a simulated network which resembles the main features of the city center of Zurich, Switzerland. By using the proposed strategy, the traffic accumulation inside the network is still stabilized, and the monetary costs due to delay are significantly reduced at the entire network (up to 25.8\%) compared to the strategy without priority. The distribution of the combined cost (including cost due to delay and tolls) is more uniform across VOT groups than that resulting from the strategy without priority. It is also shown that the proposed recursive estimation algorithm quickly converges and further improves the social welfare.}

Most studies investigating pedestrian-vehicle interactions at non-signalized intersections have focused on interactions at the crosswalk on the same approach where the vehicle is coming from, which are referred to as primary interactions in this study. However, secondary interactions, defined as interactions between vehicles exiting the intersection and crossing pedestrians, have not been adequately studied. Second interactions can pose more dangers to pedestrians due to the driver’s unclear knowledge of right-of-way, acceleration attempts to recover the speed, and the complex situation the driver faces in the intersection. This paper aims at studying the safety issue of secondary pedestrian-vehicle interactions at non-signalized intersections. For that purpose, a methodology is proposed based on surrogate measures of safety and behavioral measures derived from vision-based trajectories. This methodology is implemented through a case study involving ten all-way stop intersections from Montreal, Canada. Road user trajectory data are automatically extracted from the videos. Different measures are used in the study: from the interaction analysis that determines vehicle-pedestrian interactions based on a Distance-Velocity (DV) model, average crossing speeds and vehicle approaching behaviors in terms of speed and acceleration. Computer tools are developed to extract these measures from the trajectory data. Based on these measures, a comparative analysis is carried out between primary and secondary interactions. Results show that secondary interactions are more dangerous than primary interactions. Among the three secondary interaction types, secondary through interactions are the most dangerous.}

The rapidly growing eFHVs, on one hand, supply substantial trip services and complete the trips requiring no parking demand; on the other hand, imposes congestion effects on all commuters. In this study, we investigate the morning commute problem with bottleneck congestion and parking space constraints in the presence of ride-sourcing service. The within-day dynamic equilibrium and its travel pattern are examined. Meanwhile, we explore the optimal supply of parking spaces and ride-sourcing services to best manage the commute traffic.

Lack of charging infrastructure presents a major barrier to scaling up, but little public information exists on the infrastructure needed to support ridesourcing electrification. With data on ridesourcing trips for New York City and San Francisco, and using agent-based simulations of BEV fleets, we show that given a sparse network of three to four 50 kW chargers per square mile, BEVs can provide the same level of service as internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) at lower cost. This suggests that the cost of charging infrastructure is not a significant barrier to ridesourcing electrification. With coordinated use of charging infrastructure across vehicles, we also find that fleet performance becomes robust to variation in battery range and placement of chargers. Our analysis suggests that mandates on ridesourcing such as the California Clean Miles Standard could achieve electrification without significantly increasing the cost of ridesourcing services.}

While this type of data is relatively inexpensive to gather, it can pose multiple privacy risks, even if the location tracks are anonymous. In particular, an issue could be the possibility for an attacker to infer user location tracks from anonymous location data, which affects users privacy. In this article, we propose a new framework for analyzing a variety of privacy problems arising in transportation systems. The state of traffic is modeled by the Lighthill–Whitham–Richards traffic flow model, which is a first order scalar conservation law with a concave flux function. Given a set of traffic flow data, we show that the constraints resulting from this partial differential equation are mixed integer linear inequalities for some decision variable. These constraints allow us to determine the likelihood of two distinct location tracks being generated by the same vehicle. We then use these model-based reidentification metrics to train an artificial neural network classifier. Numerical implementations are performed on experimental data from the Mobile Century experiment, and show that this framework significantly outperforms naive reidentification techniques.}

abstract = {This paper investigates the day-to-day dynamics model from the perspective of travelers’ actual route choice behaviors, and calibrates and validates the route-based day-to-day dynamics model with the real-world license plate recognition (LPR) data. Due to the highly nonlinear and multi-modal response function in the calibration of the optimization problem, traditional gradient-based nonlinear regression algorithms or other analytical optimization approaches are inapplicable to deal with the calibration work. In this paper, a surrogate-based simulation optimization approach is proposed to deal with the expensive-to-evaluate response function in the day-to-day dynamics calibration work. More specifically, the kriging metamodel is adopted to surrogate the optimization function of the calibration process. With this meta-modeling approach, a sound solution can be achieved with only a few sampling points in a comfortably afforded computation burden, thus giving a valid estimation of the parameters in the day-to-day dynamics model. Finally, a case study based on the real-world LPR data is conducted to validate the proposed model and calibration method.}

abstract = {Although there is a low frequency of train derailments, they have been a major concern due to their high consequences justifying the need to critically examine the severity of train derailments. Derailments may result in injury, loss of life and property, interruption of services and damage of the environment. Most derailment severity models have utilized point estimation approaches which focus on the central tendency of derailment severity outcomes. However, this approach is not reliable given the high variation in derailment severity. Thus, it is imperative to take into consideration the entire severity distribution by examining other statistics including conditional quantiles. Furthermore, derailment data has been found to exhibit tail dependence, skewness and non-normality of the marginal distributions and joint distribution of the variables. Therefore, it is not appropriate to examine their interrelationships using conventional correlation analysis. For these reasons, this paper employs vine copula quantile regression model, an interval estimation approach, to predict conditional mean and quantiles of derailment severity outcomes. This novel methodology automatically tackles prominent issues in classical quantile regression including quantile crossing at various levels and interactions between covariates. Vine copulas, which are multivariate copulas constructed hierarchically from bivariate copulas as building blocks, permit the modeling of the complex dependences between the variables. The vine copula quantile regression model was found to offer better accuracy for analyzing derailment severity at various confidence levels compared to the classical quantile regression approach. The findings provide greater comprehension of the influence of the covariates on train derailment severity.}

It lays the foundation for a number of advanced functions such as driver safety monitoring systems and adaptive driving assistance systems. In these applications, state recognition accuracy is of paramount importance to guarantee user acceptance. This paper is mainly focused on developing a personalized driving state recognition system by learning from non-intrusive, easily accessible vehicle related measurements and its validation using real-world driving data. Compared to conventional approaches, this paper first highlights the necessities of adopting a personalized system by analysing feature distribution of individual driver’s data and all drivers’ data via advanced data visualization and statistical analysis. If significant differences are identified, a dedicated personalized model is learnt to predict the driver’s driving state. Spearman distance is also drawn to evaluate the differences between individual driver’s data and all drivers’ data in a quantitative manner. In addition, five categories of classifiers are tested and compared to identify a suitable one for classification, where random forest with Bayesian parameter optimization outperforms others and therefore is adopted in this paper. A recently collected dataset from real-world driving experiments is adopted to evaluate the proposed system. Comparative experimental results indicate that the personalized learning system with road information significantly outperforms conventional approaches without considering personalized characteristics or road information, where the overall accuracy increases from 81.3\% to 91.6\%. It is believed that the newly developed personalized learning system can find a wide range of applications where diverse behaviours exist.}

abstract = {Inspired by the success of private ridesourcing companies such as Uber and Lyft, transit agencies have started to consider integrating ridesourcing services (i.e. on-demand, app-driven ridesharing services) with public transit. Ridesourcing services may enhance the transit system in two major ways: replacing underutilized routes to improve operational efficiency, and providing last-mile connectivity to extend transit’s catchment area. While an integrated system of ridesourcing services and public transit is conceptually appealing, little is known regarding whether and how consumers might use a system like this and what key service attributes matter the most to them. This article investigates traveler responses to a proposed integrated transit system, named MTransit, at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor campus. We conducted a large-sample survey to collect both revealed preference (RP) and stated preference (SP) data and fit a RP-SP mixed logit model to examine the main determinants of commuting mode choice. The model results show that transfers and additional pickups are major deterrents for MTransit use. We further applied the model outputs to forecast the demand for MTransit under different deployment scenarios. We find that replacing low-ridership bus lines with ridesourcing services could slightly increase transit ridership while reducing operations costs. The service improvements offered by ridesourcing mainly come from reductions in wait time. Though relatively small in our study, another source of improvement is the decrease of in-vehicle travel time. Moreover, we find that when used to provide convenient last-mile connections, ridesourcing could provide a significant boost to transit. This finding verifies a popular notion among transit professionals that ridesourcing services can serve as a complement to public transit by enhancing last-mile transit access.}

However, most car-following models are deterministic and do not capture the stochastic nature of human perception. It is expected that purely deterministic traffic models may produce unrealistic results due to the stochastic driving behaviors of drivers. This paper is devoted to the development of a distinct car-following model where a stochastic process is adopted to describe the time-varying random acceleration which essentially reflects the random individual perception of driver behavior with respect to the leading vehicle over time. In particular, we apply coupled Langevin equations to model complex human driver behavior. In the proposed model, an extended Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) stochastic process will be used to describe the stochastic speed of the follower in response to the stimulus of the leader. An important property of the extended CIR process is to enhance the non-negative properties of the stochastic traffic variables (e.g. non-negative speed) for any arbitrary model parameters. Based on stochastic process theories, we derive stochastic linear stability conditions which, for the first time, theoretically capture the effect of the random parameter on traffic instabilities. Our stability results conform to the empirical results that the traffic instability is related to the stochastic nature of traffic flow at the low speed conditions, even when traffic is deemed to be stable from deterministic models.}

Existing works mainly focused on prediction and monitoring of regular passenger flow, which are not suitable for burst passenger flow. In this article, we first formulate the problem as early warning of burst passenger flow. Next, we design a novel framework to solve this problem by our observation that a burst passenger in-flow usually comes after an abnormal passenger out-flow for a subway station, especially when there is a large-scale social crowd event. Our framework consists of two models: (1) Abnormal out-flow detection (AOFD) which detects abnormal out-flows and warns the city administration of the burst in-flow fairly ahead of time. (2) Burst in-flow peak estimation (BIFPE) which estimates burst in-flow peak time and volume. We evaluate our framework with real-world smartcard data of the largest city in China and use large-scale social crowd event data to further explain our model. The result shows that: (1) AOFD can detect abnormal out-flows that would later result in bursts in-flows with better performance and can send warning signal ahead of the time of burst passenger in-flow. (2) BIFPE can effectively estimate the peak time of burst in-flow and can reduce peak volume estimation error compared with the traditional passenger flow prediction models.}

To comply with the ECA regulation, the industrial shipping service operator can adjust its vessel speeds and fleet size to minimize the annual fleet cost, which includes the total fleet operating cost and in-transit cargo inventory cost. A mixed-integer convex cost-minimization model is developed for the determination of optimal vessel speeds and fleet size, in which the vessel speeds are continuous decision variables and the fleet size is an integer decision variable. The analytical optimal solution of the developed model is identified by relaxing the integer restriction of the fleet size variable. It is shown that how the in-transit cargo inventory cost can play a role in changing the way that the optimal vessel speed is identified. We also demonstrate that the minimal annual fleet cost could be attained by simply comparing two candidate analytical solutions. Numerical studies are carried out to investigate the economic and environmental impacts of the ECA regulation on several representative industrial shipping services.

abstract = {Transit Signal Priority (TSP) is a commonly used strategy to improve bus operations at signalized intersections. However, the impacts of TSP in mixed traffic environments has not been analytically studied. This is a challenging problem since car queues can slow down buses, while slow-moving buses can create bottlenecks for cars in mixed traffic. Furthermore, it is typically assumed that TSP is activated using bus information obtained from a fixed detector. The benefits of TSP to buses could be improved by using information from connected buses or even connected cars. To tackle these challenges, this paper models buses as moving bottlenecks, incorporating it into a kinematic wave theory (KWT) model. A dynamic programming (DP) algorithm is developed to evaluate the changes in delays to buses and cars caused by TSP using KWT and queuing theories considering the bus as a moving bottleneck. The proposed algorithm is utilized for sensitivity tests to determine the changes to car and bus delays as a result of TSP implementation as a function of the bus detector location, bus stop location and dwell duration, the existence of a downstream bottleneck, and bus detection technology. The detector location sensitivity analysis reveals that there exists an optimal (and different) bus detector location associated with each demand. The bus stop location and bus dwell duration sensitivity tests show that TSP implementation can reduce system-wide (i.e., total car and bus) delays. However, in general, it is found that the presence of a downstream bottleneck can diminish the benefits of providing TSP. Finally, different bus detection technologies are tested to quantify the benefits of using connected buses or connected cars for TSP provision in terms of car and bus delay savings. As a result of this test, it is found that connected cars can significantly improve both car and bus delays if used for TSP provision.}

This paper reviews maritime traffic models from the vessel behavior modeling perspective. The maritime traffic models include the models for vessel traffic both at sea and in confined water area. The aim of this paper is to analyze the underlying modeling paradigms and to assess the extent in which maritime traffic models can represent vessel behavior. Focusing on vessel behavior modeling, this paper provides a broad overview of the current literature on maritime traffic models of the last decades. The commercial models are not included due to the limit of information. To compare the capabilities of models in capturing the vessel behavior characteristics, the considered models are assessed from different aspects of vessel behavior representation, external impact modeling, and model applicability. The assessment shows that none of the existing models describe all dynamic kinetic information in detail for different vessels and consider the impacts from a full range of external factors, which is possibly due to the specific purpose when the models were developed. The models developed for specific vessels in specific situations ignore the irrespective behavioral details in other possible scenarios. Models without proper calibration and validation limit the applicability in other cases. It also indicates that few models can accurately simulate the different vessel behavior at a microscopic level. To investigate the possible potential and limitations, the models have been assessed and discussed to indicate the underlying modeling paradigms based on the modeling characteristics. Future developments can focus on the behavior of different vessels in different types of water areas and the corresponding impacts from external conditions (e.g. visibility, wind, current), vessel encounters and traffic rules. Through calibration and validation, future models should be able to fit the vessel behavior in real-life situations.}

In this paper, we define the cyclist operational level and argue that it consists of two intertwined processes, a mental and a physical process. The mental process refers to path choices made within a route and the physical process refers to the bicycle control dynamics through pedalling and steering. We propose a novel two-layer framework, where each layer captures the tasks of one of the processes within the operational level. Discrete choice theory is proposed to model each layer. The plausibility of the framework is demonstrated through an application focusing on the queue formation process upstream of a red traffic light, including selecting a queuing position and cycling towards it. Models are estimated for the two layers using cyclist trajectory data collected at a signalised intersection in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The models reveal the attributes that influence the decisions made in each layer and are face validated using simulation. The proposed framework and the (behavioural) findings of its application are the main scientific contributions of this paper, which pave the way for future research.}

The method is based on a nonlinear state-space system derived from aircraft point-mass performance models. Using only aircraft surveillance data, flight states such as position, velocity, wind speed, and air temperature are collected and used for the estimations. With the regularized Sample Importance Re-sampling particle filter, we are able to estimate the aircraft mass within 30 seconds once an aircraft is airborne. Using this short flight segment allows the assumption of constant mass and thrust setting. The segment at the start of the climb also represents the time when maximum thrust setting is most likely to occur. This study emphasizes an important aspect of the estimation problem, the observation noise modeling. Four observation noise models are proposed, which are all based on the native navigation accuracy parameters that have been obtained automatically from the surveillance data. Simulations and experiments are conducted to test the theoretical model. The results show that the particle filter is able to quantify uncertainties, as well as determine the noise limit for an accurate estimation. The method of this study is tested with a data-set consisting of 50 Cessna Citation II flights where true masses were recorded.}

Separation between AV and HV traffic through the deployment of dedicated AV lanes is foreseen as an effective method of amplifying the benefits of AVs and promoting their adoption. However, it is important to consider mixed AV and HV traffic in a transportation network. On the one hand, it may be impractical to deploy dedicated AV lanes throughout the network, while on the other hand, dedicated AV lanes may even reduce the total traffic efficiency of a road segment when the AV flow rate is low. In this study, we considered a new form of managed lanes for AVs, designated as autonomous vehicle/toll (AVT) lanes, which grant free access to AVs while allowing HVs to access the lanes by paying a toll. We investigated the optimal deployment of dedicated AV lanes and AVT lanes in transportation networks with mixed AV and HV flows. The user equilibrium (UE) problem in a transportation network with mixed flows of AVs and HVs is first explored. We formulated the UE problem as a link-based variational inequality (VI) and identified that, with different impacts of AVs on road capacity, the UE problem can have unique or non-unique flow patterns. Considering that the UE problem may have non-unique flow distributions, we proposed a robust optimal deployment model, which is a generalized semi-infinite min-max program, to deploy the dedicated AV lanes and AVT lanes so that the system performance under the worst-case flow distributions is optimized. We proposed effective solution algorithms to solve these models and presented numerical studies to demonstrate the models and the solution algorithms. The results show that the system performance can be significantly improved through the deployment of dedicated AV lanes and AVT lanes.}

It is a fundamental problem in the modeling of transportation where the synthetic populations of micro-agents represent a key input to most agent-based models. In this paper, a new methodological framework for how to ‘grow’ pools of micro-agents is presented. The model framework adopts a deep generative modeling approach from machine learning based on a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Compared to the previous population synthesis approaches, including Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF), Gibbs sampling and traditional generative models such as Bayesian Networks or Hidden Markov Models, the proposed method allows fitting the full joint distribution for high dimensions. The proposed methodology is compared with a conventional Gibbs sampler and a Bayesian Network by using a large-scale Danish trip diary. It is shown that, while these two methods outperform the VAE in the low-dimensional case, they both suffer from scalability issues when the number of modeled attributes increases. It is also shown that the Gibbs sampler essentially replicates the agents from the original sample when the required conditional distributions are estimated as frequency tables. In contrast, the VAE allows addressing the problem of sampling zeros by generating agents that are virtually different from those in the original data but have similar statistical properties. The presented approach can support agent-based modeling at all levels by enabling richer synthetic populations with smaller zones and more detailed individual characteristics.}

A new solution that incorporates CNN is proposed to tackle the issues of inefficiency and inadequate manners of visualization in existing methods. The method operates along vehicle trajectory recorded in MLS data. For any driver position, the initial VF is defined as a fan-shaped area originating at the driver’s viewpoint. Within the initial VF, numerous virtual line-of-sights (LOS) are emitted from the viewpoint. Given an object point in any LOS, three-dimensional (3D) MLS points that may affect its visibility are converted to two-dimensional (2D) points using the cylindrical perspective projection. 2D points on the projective surface are then transformed into a binary image via the Pixelation procedure. Fed with the generated image, the CNN which is trained based on 789,500 data will classify the visibility as: 0-visible or 1-invisible. The location of the obstacle that blocks the driver’s view along each LOS is detected with a combination of the trained CNN and the bisection method. With all positions of obstacles determined, the final VF is established. Through comparisons with a state-of-the-art method, the CNN-based method shows remarkable efficiency, which facilitates either VF modeling at a single position or successive VF analyses along the vehicle path. A case study is also presented to show the improved manners of data visualization implemented in the developed method: (1) 3D viewshed, (2) sight distance curve, and (3) the driver’s perspective image with obstacles spotlighted.}

abstract = {Signal optimization has received significant attentions from the research community. However, during peak hours, the performances of existing models still have room for improvements, especially when channelized section spillover (CSS) occurs. The evolution of CSS is dynamic in nature, not only due to the interactions between traffic flow of different movements, but also because existing CSS influences the queuing process in a channelized section and contributes to new CSS formation at the next cycle. Neglecting such spatial-temporal interaction in current traffic signal optimization procedures may lead to suboptimal results. A Monte Carlo Tree Search-based model is proposed to solve the intersection optimization problem (named MCTS-IO) with explicit modeling of CSS dynamic evolution. The model works in a rolling horizon way. At each decision point, MCTS-IO simulates the intersection by selecting a sequence of phases, and progressively updates the relative preferences of the phases. After all simulations are performed, the phase with the best policy PI is selected. Both the PI and decision space can be customized, which ensures algorithm flexibility. The method is tested against Synchro results with both stable and variable demand, which demonstrates the proposed model is always able to find a solution better than Synchro.}

abstract = {Connected vehicle technology provides promising opportunities to improve road safety, enhance traffic efficiency, and reduce fuel consumption and emissions. It has been suggested that if drivers comply with suggested recommendations, connected vehicle technology can introduce huge benefits. However, whether drivers will accept suggestions and what factors will influence their likelihood of accepting the suggestions in a connected environment have not been studied. In addition, few models have been developed to predict drivers’ reactions under such conditions. This paper aims to fill the research gap by examining and modeling drivers’ acceptance and behavior when receiving energy- and safety-related speed recommendations through vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. A mixed-subject-design experiment was conducted in a closed-loop test track, Mcity, with seven intersection maneuver scenarios. A generally high compliance rate to the recommended speed strategies was observed that during 72\% of the events, drivers changed their intersection-approaching behavior to follow the recommendations. Mixed models were conducted to explore the impacting factors while Principal Component Analysis was used to classify subjective (i.e., self-reported) data into four categories. To predict drivers’ reactions when offered a speed suggestion, Random Forests were built with 13 independent variables, derived from four categories: vehicle kinematic features, device information, driver characteristics, and subjective data. Using this model, drivers’ reactions during each intersection maneuver could be predicted with a reasonably high accuracy about 87.4 m away from the intersection, where the vehicle started to receive signal phase and timing information. Findings in this study can contribute to the optimization of energy-saving algorithms and the improvement of driving safety by using connected vehicle technologies.}

In practice, some of these bookings are finally cancelled without loading any containers onto the ships, which leads to a low loading rate and revenue loss. However, deep analyses of container slot booking cancellation in container liner services rarely appear in the literature due to the lack of real data. The characteristics and patterns of the container slot booking cancellation are unclear from both academic and managerial perspectives. To fill this gap, this study first proposes a conceptual model for the container slot booking cancellation analysis in intercontinental shipping services. A case study on a container liner service between Asia and US west coast is then conducted based on the proposed model. The static and dynamic cancellation rates of voyage, the attributes of bookings, and the factors that may influence the cancellation behaviours are inspected and discussed. The primary findings of this study will benefit both the academic research on container shipping slot bookings and the practices of the slot cancellation control in container shipping company.}

abstract = {The roles of learning, inertia and real-time travel information on route choices in a highly disrupted network are investigated, based on data from a laboratory competitive route choice game. Routing policies instead of simple paths are treated as the subject of learning when real-time travel information is available, where a routing policy is defined as a contingency plan that maps realized traffic conditions to path choices. A learning model based on the power law of forgetting and reinforcement is applied to calculate the perceived travel times of alternative routing policies, based on which choices are made. A deterministic correction to the Logit choice model in a learning context is developed to account for overlapping routing policies. Model parameter estimates are obtained from maximizing the likelihood of making the observed choices on the current day based on choices from all previous days. Prediction performance is measured in terms of both one-step and full-trajectory predictions, based on observed choices up to today, in which one-step prediction entails predicting the next day’s choice, while full-trajectory prediction entails predicting the next K days’ choices. Three major conclusions are drawn. First, the routing policy learning model can capture travelers’ learning and choice behavior better than a path-based model under real-time travel information, as it accounts for travelers’ forward-looking capabilities. Secondly, inertia exists where travelers stick to previously chosen routes and do not necessarily minimize travel time. Inertia plays a dominant role in one-step prediction, and a less important role in full-trajectory prediction, suggesting that learning is more important in longer term prediction. Thirdly, relative importance of learning compared with inertia is more prominent in a less uncertain, but not close to deterministic, environment. Therefore, decreasing uncertainty by providing real-time information could encourage learning and potentially more optimal decisions for individuals and the system.}

Lane-changing modelling in the connected environment has so far received little attention. This is due to the novelty of connected environment, and the consequent scarcity of data. A behaviourally sound lane-changing model is not even available for the traditional environment; that is, an environment without driving aids. To address this need, this study develops a game theory-based mandatory lane-changing model (AZHW model) for the traditional environment and extends it for the connected environment. The CARRS-Q advanced driving simulator is used to collect high-quality vehicle trajectory data for the connected environment. The developed models (for traditional environment and connected environment) are calibrated using NGSIM and simulator data in a bi-level calibration framework. The performance of the models has been rigorously evaluated using various performance indicators. These include the true positive, false positive, detection rate, false alarm rate, time prediction error, and location prediction error. Results consistently show that the developed game theory-based models can effectively capture mandatory lane-changing decisions with a high degree of accuracy. Furthermore, the performance of the developed AZHW models is compared with representative game theory-based lane-changing models in the literature. The comparative analysis reveals that the AZHW models developed in this study outperform existing models.}

A two-stage optimization problem is introduced into the design of flex-route transit operations. Mixed integer programming (MIP) is employed to formulate the problem with a twofold objective: to serve as many requests as possible and to minimize the total trip time of the accepted passengers. A memetic algorithm is adopted to solve the problem in a reasonable amount of time. Simulation experiments based on a real-life flex-route transit service are conducted to assess the benefits of introducing meeting points. The results demonstrate that meeting points can significantly reduce the rejection rate by up to 24\% at the cost of walking an acceptable distance. We also find that reducing the passenger fare to compensate for the inconvenience of walking to meeting points constitutes a win–win strategy that benefits both passengers and transit operators.}

Given a fleet of trucks, where each truck carries a given number of drones, the objective consists in designing feasible routes and drone operations such that all customers are served and minimal makespan is achieved. We formulate the VRPD as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP), which can be solved by any standard MILP solver. Moreover, with the aim of improving the performance of solvers, we introduce several sets of valid inequalities (VIEQ). Due to limited performance of the solvers in addressing large instances, we propose a matheuristic approach that effectively exploits the problem structure of the VRPD. Integral to this approach, we propose the Drone Assignment and Scheduling Problem (DASP) that, given an existing routing of trucks, looks for an optimal assignment and schedule of drones such that the makespan is minimized. In this context, we propose two MILP formulations for the DASP. In order to evaluate the performance of a state-of-the-art solver in tackling the MILP formulation of the VRPD, the benefit of the proposed VIEQs, and the performance of the matheuristic, we carried out extensive computational experiments. According to the numerical results, the use of drones can significantly reduce the makespan and the proposed VIEQ as well as the matheuristic approach have a significant contribution in solving the VRPD effectively.}

In this study, we proposed to use the publicly accessible Google Street View (GSV) panorama images to estimate and predict the occurrence of sun glare. GSV images have view sight similar to drivers, which make GSV images suitable for estimating the visibility of sun glare to drivers. A recently developed convolutional neural network algorithm was used to segment GSV images and predict obstructions on sun glare. Based on the predicted obstructions for given locations, we further estimated the time windows of sun glare by calculating the sun positions and the relative angles between drivers and the sun for those locations. We conducted a case study in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. Results show that the method can predict the occurrence of sun glare precisely. The proposed method provides an important tool for people to deal with the sun glare and reduce the potential traffic accidents caused by the sun glare.}

We develop an integrated multi-lane stochastic continuous car-following model where a deep learning architecture is used to estimate a probability of lane-changing (LC) manoeuvres. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the very few papers which exploit deep learning to model driving behaviour on a multi-lane road. The objective of this study is to establish a coupled stochastic continuous multi-lane car-following model using Langevin equations to cope with probabilistic characteristics of LC manoeuvres. In particular, a stochastic volatility, derived from LC manoeuvres is introduced in a multi-lane stochastic optimal velocity model (SOVM). In additions, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is applied to estimate a probability of LC manoeuvres in the integrated multi-lane car-following model. Furthermore, imaged second-based trajectories of the lane-changer and surrounding vehicles are used to identify whether LC manoeuvres occur by using the CNN. Finally, the proposed method is validated using a real-world high-resolution vehicle trajectory dataset. The results indicate that the prediction of the integrated SOVM is almost identical to the observed trajectories of the lane-changers and the following vehicles in the initial and the target lane. It has been found that the proposed multi-lane SOVM can tackle the unpredictable fluctuations in the velocity of the vehicles in the acceleration/deceleration zone.}

Further, this study used hyper-heuristic optimisation to obtain the lane-changing advisory proportion of each segment upstream of lane drop. Conditions of different traffic demands were analysed using the microscopic traffic simulation software AIMSUN and its Application Program Interface (API) function. Results indicated that the proposed lane-changing advisory strategy could reduce traffic congestion and obviously improve traffic efficiency. This study also analysed the effects with different proportions of connected vehicles and found that if the connected vehicle ratio is less than 20\%, the lane-changing advisory has little impact on the lane drop performance, and that if the penetration rate is more than 50\%, the gain in performance is marginal.}

The aim of this paper is to assess the effects of the introduction of LPV-200 procedures for air traffic safety which was determined by the probability of a CFIT (Controlled Flight Into Terrain) accident – PoC. Factors affecting PoC are of a diverse nature, some of which are subjective and cannot be expressed precisely. Therefore, PoC assessment uses fuzzy logic methods, and more specifically hierarchical fuzzy inference systems, with a knowledge base obtained from experts. As a result of simulation experiments, PoC was determined for airports with various levels of navigational equipment. It was also found that the introduction of LPV-200 procedures allows the reduction of PoC, with the highest effect being achieved for the least equipped airports. Also, in the event of failure of the main approach assistance system ILS, the use of LPV-200 procedures allows maintaining PoC at the same or close to the basic value level. The results of our research indicate that the introduction of LPV-200 procedures is clearly positive for the commercial use of small, less equipped aerodromes. We have shown that thanks to employing LPV-200 procedures it is possible to keep the PoC at a level similar to typical commercial airports.}

These studies found significant differences in crashes between population groups and geographical locations with various socio-economic characteristics. However, driver-behavioral factors, specifically speeding behavior, which is a critical aspect of traffic safety, have received less attention in case of analyzing the impact of local characteristics on driver-behavioral choices that might increase the risk of crashes. The impact of local characteristics on various driver behaviors is getting even more important as the data from the connected and automated vehicles as well as similar second-by-second trajectory level data from naturalistic driving studies are becoming more available. In fact, neglecting mentioned impact might lead to erroneous inferences due to the disparities in socioeconomic characteristics in different regions. Therefore, this paper, for the first time, utilized multilevel logistic regression modeling approach to evaluate the effect of driver's locality-related factors on driver speeding behavior using naturalistic driving data collected from the SHRP2 project in six US states. The results showed that the geographical location of drivers accounted for about 7.7\% of the variability in the likelihood of a driver driving over the posted speed, regardless of other explanatory variables. The methodology and the results from this study can pave the road for future human factor studies utilizing trajectory-level data from different geographical locations to reduce the heterogeneity and increase the transferability of the results without introducing a bias in inferences.}

The highly anticipated, future connected vehicle environment (CVE) is expected to reduce associated crash risk of lane-changing by providing driving aids, which utilise surrounding traffic information. The impact of CVE driving on safety during mandatory lane-changing, however, is unknown due to the novelty of the CVE and consequent scarcity of the data. As such, this study examines the effects of the CVE on safety during mandatory lane-changing manoeuvres. Seventy-eight participants performed mandatory lane-changing manoeuvres in a driving simulator experiment in the CARRS-Q Advanced Driving Simulator. The randomised driving conditions included baseline driving (without driving aids), CVE driving with perfect communication (on-time supply of driving aids), and CVE driving with communication delay (delayed supply of driving aids). The minimum gap time, which is a surrogate measure of safety representing time-to-collision, between the interacting vehicles during the mandatory lane-changing was modelled using a parametric accelerated failure time (AFT) hazard-based duration model. A gamma frailty specification was used to capture structured heterogeneity arising from the repeated measures design of the experiment. The AFT model reveals that the gap time during mandatory lane-changing manoeuvres is longer during CVE driving with perfect communication compared to both the baseline and CVE driving with communication delay scenarios. The gap times for young (18–26 years) and male drivers are shorter in the traditional driving environment, but longer during CVE driving with perfect communication. Overall, CVE driving assists drivers by increasing the safety and efficiency of mandatory lane-changing tasks.}

Dwell times in stations are in particular subject to a high variability and are hard to predict; this is mostly due to the interactions between passengers and the railway system during the dwelling process. This paper presents a data-driven approach for assessing the influence of the numbers of alighting, boarding and on board passengers on the dwell time. We propose to split the dwell time into a deterministic component depending on the passenger flow, called the Minimum Dwell Time, and a random component. A method for estimating the minimum dwell time is provided. Based on the knowledge of this value, observations can be classified according to the main determinant of dwell time, namely timetable constraints or passenger exchange. The latter observations are used for estimating the conditional distribution of dwell time given passenger flows. Numerical experiments are carried out on stations located inside the dense traffic area of Paris suburban network. The obtained results indicate that the presented method can be used for a variety of applications, such as capacity assessment or stochastic simulation.}

With the development of intelligent navigation and autonomous driving, it is necessary to explore the lane-level predictions of traffic speeds. However, most existing traffic prediction models concentrate on forecasting the traffic flow characteristics of the entire road sections rather than those of certain lanes. This paper proposes a fusion deep learning (FDL) model to predict lane-level traffic speed. First, the entropy-based grey relation analysis is introduced to choose lane sections that are strongly correlated with the lane section to be predicted. Second, a two-layer deep learning framework is established by combining the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network and the gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network. Third, the ground-truth data of several lane sections captured by remote traffic microwave sensors (RTMS) on the 2nd Ring Road of Beijing are utilized to examine the FDL model and compare it with several benchmark models. The experimental result indicates that in addition to capturing the fluctuations of traffic speed at the lane level, the FDL model has better performance than the benchmark models in terms of prediction accuracy and stability.}

abstract = {Vehicle trajectory data collected via GPS-enabled devices have played increasingly important roles in estimating network-wide traffic, given their broad spatial-temporal coverage and representativeness of traffic dynamics. This paper exploits taxi GPS data, license plate recognition (LPR) data, and geographical information for reconstructing the spatial and temporal patterns of urban traffic emissions. Vehicle emission factor models are employed to estimate emissions based on taxi trajectories. The estimated emissions are then mapped to spatial grids of urban areas to account for spatial heterogeneity. To extrapolate emissions from the taxi fleet to the whole vehicle population, we use Gaussian process regression (GPR) models supported by geographical features to estimate the spatially heterogeneous traffic volume and fleet composition. Unlike previous studies, this paper utilizes the taxi GPS data and LPR data to disaggregate vehicle and emission characteristics through space and time in a large-scale urban network. The results of a case study in Hangzhou, China, reveal high-resolution spatio-temporal patterns of traffic flows and emissions, and identify emission hotspots. This study provides an accessible means of inferring the environmental impact of urban traffic with multi-source urban data that are now widely available in urban areas.}

This study aims to leverage massive vehicle trajectory data for proactive safety analytics. State-of-the-art computer vision techniques are employed to automatically extract massive vehicle trajectories from 70-hour traffic video data at two intersections in Brooklyn, New York City. The novelty of our trajectory extraction algorithm includes the inclusion of high-level information from foreground/background separation to cluster feature points that belong to the same vehicle and the use of non-parametric clustering method Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model (DPGMM) that does not require specification of the cluster number. The amount of video data used in this case study is substantially greater than what was previously used in most of literature. Surrogate safety measures in terms of time to collision are introduced to identify rear-end conflict risk for adjacent vehicles. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are then proposed to model the rear-end conflicts at five-minute intervals. The proposed HMMs are found to have better performance in terms of representing the conflict occurrence and their predictive abilities are comparable to the classical autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. HMMs are then used to infer the hidden states of traffic safety. As a result, frequent switches between different states and a clustering of high-risk states are observed. The modeling results imply that HMMs can help monitor the prevailing traffic conditions and facilitate proactive safety management.}

abstract = {This paper presents a discrete control framework for a homogeneous vehicle platoon, which can minimize the energy consumption of each vehicle while ensuring the platoon string stability under external interference and communication delay. First, a novel variable spacing strategy named as the energy-oriented spacing policy is proposed by comparing the geometry relationship of each vehicle which drives at energy-optimal speed and the ideal speed under the constant spacing policy. Then, based on the energy-oriented spacing policy, the dynamics of a homogeneous discrete vehicle platoon composed of several pure electric vehicles are built, including the communication delay and external disturbance. Second, a discrete robust platoon controller that can reduce the conservatism of the control system is designed based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii theorem and H∞ method, which drives each vehicle at their energy-optimal speed while ensuring the string stability of platoon under communication delays and interferences. Third, the L2-based string stability of the discrete platoon is defined, and its string-stable criterion is given under communication delays and external disturbances. Simulation results indicate that the proposed energy-oriented spacing policy and the discrete controller can enable efficient driving of each vehicle while ensuring the platoon string stability. The energy consumption of the whole platoon is, respectively, reduced by 7.3\% and 5.7\% compared to the vehicle platoon controllers with constant spacing policy and constant time headway policy.}

abstract = {Raffles have been widely used in commercial markets to influence consumers’ behaviors. Instead of charging users a fee or issuing a credit to users as incentives, the raffle-based scheme incentivizes users to change their choices by giving out credits that are used to enter a lottery. Comparing to tolls or credits, raffles may be less controversial since it is based on voluntary participation. The promises of a raffle-based scheme is that users are more risk-seeking, thus willing to participate in the lottery, when stakes are low. This would particularly fit the traffic management where the cost for a user to change his/her choices may be relatively insignificant comparing to the reward of a raffle. This paper examines the effect of raffle or lotteries for travel demand management, particularly in the morning commute. We establish the utility-based user equilibrium by incorporating risks and uncertainties in users’ choices. A class of Flat Raffle schemes is proposed where a constant lottery winning chance is set for a period of time during the morning commute. We show that a marginal user who is indifferent from participating the lottery or not would exist for arbitrary utility functions. Furthermore, we analytically derive and solve for the equilibrium using exponential utility functions, and subsequently the optimal travel profiles under four potential system management objectives. We find that minimizing the total generalized travel cost (TTC) seems a reasonable goal for an optimal Flat Raffle possibly resulting in approximately minimum commuting duration and minimum total queuing delay at the same time. Under the minimum TTC, there is no queuing delay for the user who is indifferent from participating the lottery or not. Most interestingly, a Flat Raffle scheme works the best and outperforms the optimal one-step toll, when the population is overall slightly risk-seeking. This is particularly appealing since the raffle reward is relatively significant comparing with a not-so-significant cost increase associated with users’ behavioral change.}

This study presents a new approach to predict rail and geometry defects that relies on easy-to-obtain data and integrates prediction with inspection and maintenance scheduling activities. In the proposed approach, a novel use of risk-averse and hybrid prediction methodology controls the underestimation of defects. Then, a discounted Markov decision process model utilizes these predictions to determine optimal inspection and maintenance scheduling policies. Furthermore, in the presence of capacity constraints, Whittle indices via the multi-armed restless bandit formulation dynamically provide the optimal policies using the updated transition kernels. Results indicate a high accuracy rate in prediction and effective long-term scheduling policies that are adaptable to changing conditions.}

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework that can simultaneously make multi-step predictions for all stations in a large scale metro system. A sequence to sequence model embedded with the attention mechanism forms the backbone of this framework. The sequence to sequence model consists of an encoder network and a decoder network, making it good at modeling sequential data with varying lengths and the attention mechanism further enhances its ability to capture long-range dependencies. We use the proposed framework to predict the number of passengers alighting at each station in the near future, given the number of passengers boarding at each station in the last few short-term periods. The large quantities of real-world data collected from Singapore’s metro system are used to validate the proposed model. In addition, a set of comparisons made among our model and other classical approaches evidently indicates that the proposed model is more scalable and robust than other baselines in making multi-step and network-wide predictions for short-term passenger flow.}

Our results show that self-efficacy positively affects the perceived ease of use and intention to use, while the relative advantage affects perceived usefulness. Psychological ownership affects the intention to use but not the perceived usefulness.

abstract = {It is becoming common to use instrumented probe vehicles (IPV) equipped with perception sensors (e.g., LIDAR or radar) to monitor ambient traffic for empirical studies of traffic dynamics and driver behavior, while the rapidly advancing field of autonomous vehicles (AV) uses perception sensors to identify and mitigate hazards. Yet the perception sensors are far from perfect, so targets of interest go undetected. The “unseen” targets might lead to inaccurate theories of traffic flow or worse, autonomous vehicle crashes. The challenge with the unseen targets is that it is difficult to detect the absence. There is little study of how vehicle-mounted perception sensors perform “in the wild” because often the perception sensors themselves usually provide the best measurements available. The focus of this work is IPV data for offline study, but the general findings are also relevant for perception sensors used in AV applications. While there is a growing number of IPV data sets, to date most suffer from the lack of independent validation of the perception sensors. This paper fuses individual vehicle actuations from loop detectors and concurrent ambient vehicle trajectories collected from an IPV to provide a rare opportunity to assess the perception sensor performance in situ, using the loop detector data to “see” what is missed by the perception sensors. While the specific results are unique to the IPV, one should expect similar biases from other perception sensor data; though without an independent measure like the loop detectors in this study, it will be difficult to quantify what goes unseen in those data sets. These findings also highlight the need to develop means to actively calibrate mobile perception sensors for AV's. It is important to capture the behavior of these systems in situ, as maintained by private owners, though we envision in the case of an AV the role of the loop detectors might be replaced with localization information from other AV's. The data fusion has added benefits for the study of traffic dynamics, with the loop detectors providing continuous monitoring at the detector locations and the IPV providing spatially rich information about the ambient traffic as it travels between detector stations. This fused data set will be available upon publication.}

Due to the large scale, the trajectory data have become a potential substitute for the widely used fixed-location sensors in terms of the performance measures of transportation networks. Specifically, for traffic volume and queue length estimation, most of the trajectory data based methods in the existing literature either require high market penetration of the probe vehicles to identify the shockwave or require the prior information about the queue length distribution and the penetration rate, which may not be feasible in the real world. To overcome the limitations of the existing methods, this paper proposes a series of novel methods based on probability theory. By exploiting the stopping positions of the probe vehicles in the queues, the proposed methods try to establish and solve a single-variable equation for the penetration rate of the probe vehicles. Once the penetration rate is obtained, it can be used to project the total queue length and the total traffic volume. The validation results using both simulation data and real-world data show that the methods would be accurate enough for assistance in performance measures and traffic signal control at intersections, even when the penetration rate of the probe vehicles is very low.}

The paper considers smooth versions of two well-known responsive traffic signal control policies: the P0 policy (see Smith, 1979b, 1980 or Smith et al., 2015) and the maxpressure or MP policy (see Varaiya, 2013a). The paper gives two simple example networks where both of these smooth responsive traffic control policies give rise to decreasing throughput for increasing demands; when these demands are beyond the network capacity. The paper then suggests a simple modification of the two responsive traffic control policies and shows that the two modified policies do maximise the long run throughput of the two signal-controlled networks; both when a steady input demand D is within network capacity and also when a steady demand exceeds network capacity. The modified version of P0 is as follows: for a certain positive number K, forD⩽Kuse responsive policyP0,and forD>Kuse the green-times generated byP0whenD=K. Thus in this modification the green-time proportions generated by responsive P0 are frozen as demand passes through K; and remain fixed for all demands D which exceed K. The paper shows that the above modification when applied to a continuous version of MP also maximises throughput in both networks for all values of the steady demand D. Finally the paper considers a signal controlled network with route choice. It is shown that if routes are chosen by travellers in their own best interests then the continuous version of MP does not always maximise throughput, even if the constant input demand D is within the network capacity, but P0 does always maximise throughput, even when the constant input demand D is beyond the network capacity.}

Therefore, a framework of the decision-making training and learning is put forward in this paper. It consists of two parts: the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) training program and the high-fidelity virtual simulation environment. Then the basic microscopic behavior, car-following (CF), is trained within this framework. In addition, theoretical analysis and experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed reward functions for accelerating training using DRL. The results show that on the premise of driving comfort, the efficiency of the trained AV increases 7.9\% and 3.8\% respectively compared to the classical adaptive cruise control models, intelligent driver model and constant-time headway policy. Moreover, on a more complex three-lane section, we trained an integrated model combining both CF and lane-changing behavior, with the average speed further growing 2.4\%. It indicates that our framework is effective for AV’s decision-making learning.}

Normally, the motion control of the vehicle is composed of trajectory planning and trajectory following according to the surrounding risk factors, the vehicles’ capabilities as well as tyre/road interaction situations. However, pure trajectory following with a unique path may make the motion control of the vehicle be too careful and cautious with a large amount of steering effort. To follow a planned trajectory, the AVs with the traditional path-following control algorithms will correct their states even if the vehicles have only a slight deviation from the desired path or the vehicle detects static infrastructure like roadside trees. In this case, the safety of the AVs can be guaranteed to some degree, but the comfort and sense of hazards for the drivers are ignored, and sometimes the AVs have unusual motion behaviours which may not be acceptable to other road users. To solve this problem, this study aims to develop a safety corridor-based vehicle motion control approach by investigating human-driven vehicle behaviour and the vehicle’s dynamic capabilities. The safety corridor is derived by the manoeuvring action feedback of actual drivers as collected in a driving simulator when presented with surrounding risk elements and enables the AVs to have safe trajectories within it. A corridor-based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) has been developed which controls the vehicle state to achieve a smooth and comfortable trajectory while applying trajectory constraints using the safety corridor. The safety corridor and motion controller are assessed using four typical scenarios to show that the vehicle has a human-like or human-oriented behaviour which is expected to be more acceptable for both drivers and other road users.}

Trajectory prediction will hold a key role supporting its deployment, but it is limited by a lack of understanding of air traffic associated uncertainties, specifically contextual factors. Trajectory predictors are usually based on modelling aircraft dynamics based on intrinsic aircraft features. These aircraft operate within a known air route structure and under given meteorological conditions. However, actual aircraft trajectories are modified by the air traffic control depending on potential conflicts with other traffics. This paper introduces surrounding air traffic as a feature for ground-based trajectory prediction. The introduction of air traffic as a contextual factor is addressed by identifying aircraft which are likely to lose the horizontal separation. For doing so, this paper develops a probabilistic horizontal interdependency measure between aircraft supported by machine learning algorithms, addressing time separations at crossing points. Then, vertical profiles of flight trajectories are characterised depending on this factor and other intrinsic features. The paper has focused on the descent phase of the trajectories, using datasets corresponding to an en-route Spanish airspace volume. The proposed interdependency measure demonstrates to identify in advance conflicting situations between pairs of aircraft for this use case. This is validated by identifying associated air traffic control actions upon them and their impact on the vertical profile of the trajectories. Finally, a trajectory predictor for the vertical profile of the trajectory is developed, considering the interdependency measure and other operational factors. The paper concludes that the air traffic can be included as a factor for the trajectory prediction, impacting on the location of the top of descent for the specific case which has been studied.}

However, similar to other traffic monitoring devices, missing data is a common and critical problem in the ANPR system. To solve the missing data problem, numerous tensor-based methods have been proposed in previous studies. Most of them, however, assume that where and when missing data occur in the dataset are known. This would be impractical, because missing data may occur randomly. In this study, we propose a novel tensor-based algorithm, specifically, an iterative tensor decomposition (ITD) approach, that utilizes multidimensional inherent correlation of traffic data to detect and impute missing data in the ANPR system. The proposed algorithm is tested with a real-world ANPR system dataset. The experimental results show that missing data from the ANPR system can be classified into three cases, i.e., no missing, random elements missing, and extreme missing. The proposed ITD can accurately detect and correct missing data under different missing cases. Furthermore, ITD is also compared with other state-of-the-art methods and the results show that ITD outperforms the existing methods.}

abstract = {Bus bunching and the unevenly dispersed buses along a bus line commonly appear in an unstable high-frequency bus line system. They will lead to unreliable transit service and long waiting times for many passengers. To resist bus bunching and improve the stability of a bus line, researchers proposed some methods of adjusting the cruising speeds of buses. But their methods generally need to adjust the speeds in all road segments included in the bus line and sometimes need to coordinate the speeds of successively cruising buses. These requirements impede their implementations in practice. This paper presents a new strategy to overcome the above obstacles by adjusting the speeds of buses in the dedicated bus lanes. The regulating speed will be determined by looking multiple critical time points ahead to estimate the influence of the chosen speed. Numerical experiments show that the new strategy can not only stabilize a strongly unstable bus line but also shorten the waiting and riding times of passengers. Several insights have also been uncovered during numerical analyses. a. The set of regulating speeds used by an effective speed adjustment strategy should include refined elements and has a wide range for the values of its elements. b. Only with nonnegative elements in the above set, the strategy will be out of work. c. The more dedicated bus lanes in a bus line, the more effective the strategy becomes. The negligible computational time to supply the proper regulating speed makes the implementation of our strategy practical.}

abstract = {With the applications of electric buses (e-buses), potential solutions to problems related to infrastructures for charging e-buses are emerging. This study particularly focused on large-scale fast charging-station planning for e-buses in the public transportation electrification process, according to the characteristics of e-bus operation and plug-in fast charging mode. We conducted an interdisciplinary study to optimize planning jointly under the transportation system and power grid. In addition to capturing the spatiality of the e-bus charging service network, we further considered temporality in order to conduct long-term planning in view of the continuously growing e-bus charging demand. A spatial-temporal model, which determines the sites and sizes of e-bus charging stations, was proposed and the strategies for multistage infrastructure planning were put forward. The model was equivalently transformed into a mixed-integer second-order cone programming with high computational efficiency. The model and the multistage planning strategies were justified through a series of numerical experiments. A case study of Shenzhen, China was implemented and the robustness of the model to plan changes was studied.}

The framework depicts a powerful combination of a data-driven control method that is used to imitate the control behaviour of dispatchers and a mathematical optimization method. Three components comprise the DDHC framework: a data-driven control module, a performance module, and an optimization module. The data-driven control module contains a random forest model which is adopted to justify whether to intervene in the operation of a bus line, and if so, which vehicles should be controlled and what type of control strategy should be taken – an acceleration strategy or deceleration strategy. The performance module including vehicle operation state models is used to describe the system evolution. The last component optimizes the specific control actions – which type of acceleration or deceleration strategy should be adopted – by minimizing total passenger travel time. The effectiveness of the proposed DDHC framework is evaluated with the data of a transit route in Urumqi, China. The results show that the DDHC framework with reasonable parameters can suit the needs of real-time control in complex traffic environments.}

These companies employ surge pricing in real time to balance the needs of both drivers and riders. The prediction of surge prices in the next few minutes to hours encapsulates the complex evolution of service fleets and service demand in the short term. Surge pricing, if effectively predicted and disseminated to both drivers and riders, can be used to more efficiently allocate vehicles, save users money and time, and provide profitable insight to drivers, which ultimately helps the efficiency and reliability of transportation networks. This paper explores the spatio-temporal correlations between the urban environment, traffic flow characteristics, and surge multipliers. We propose a general framework for predicting the short-term evolution of surge multipliers in real-time using a log-linear model with L1 regularization, coupled with pattern clustering. This model is able to predict Uber surge multipliers in Pittsburgh up to two hours in advance using data from the previous hour out-performing the overall mean and the historical average in all but 3 of the 49 locations in Pittsburgh and outperforming three non-linear methods in 28 of the 49 locations. The model is able to out-perform the overall mean, historical mean, and non-linear methods on Lyft surge multipliers in Pittsburgh up to 20 min in advance. Cross-correlation of Uber and Lyft surge multipliers is also explored.}

However, technology constraints such as communication delays and GPS error affect the accuracy of a DSRC-based ReCWS. This paper proposes a ReCWS design that explicitly represents functional specifications of DSRC technology, including transmission delay specifications that describe the information transmission process and an error-component safety distance specification used to represent the effect of GPS error and the information propagation delay. We propose three collision warning strategies each with different deceleration requirements. The system is assembled with off-the-shelf DSRC and mobile technology that can be readily installed into test vehicles. To test the effectiveness of the proposed ReCWS, we ran a variety of controlled scenarios on a test track. The results show a high degree of warning accuracy. These field test results also provide calibrated system parameter values for future studies and designs of DSRC-based ReCWSs.}

This paper develops an integrated and systematic framework for the optimization of bimodal urban networks using 3D-MFDs, considering the complexities of bimodality. With the proposed framework, effective strategies can be designed for the planning, management, and control of bimodal networks. In particular, strategies to provide public transport priority on the network level can be holistically evaluated. We apply this methodological framework to propose, model, and analyze one such strategy to provide public transport priority in the perimeter of urban networks. The proposed strategy addresses a pressing problem of the existing perimeter control (i.e. gating) schemes: public transport vehicles will be queuing with the cars in the perimeter and hence blocked from entering the network. This impairs the service quality of public transport. Adopting our proposed strategy, the inflows of public transport and cars can be regulated independently (i.e. both inflows are controllable), the network traffic can be managed more efficiently, and public transport priority can be provided. The performance of the proposed strategy is evaluated both analytically and with simulations. Results show that the proposed strategy always performs better than existing perimeter control schemes in terms of passenger mobility. Most importantly, it differentiates the public transport mode and the car mode, with much smaller queueing time outside the network for public transport. This can shift the transportation system to a more sustainable state in the long run. Policy recommendations are provided for a large range of traffic scenarios.}

This route-choice behavior is important in determining traffic management, evacuation efficiency and building design. Here, we use field observations and a virtual experiment to study the route choice behavior of pedestrians around obstacles delimiting exit routes and examine the influence of three factors, namely the local distance to route starting points and the pedestrian density and walking speeds along routes. Crucially, both field study and virtual experiment consider the same scenario which allows us to directly assess the validity of testing pedestrian behavior in virtual environments. We find that in both data sets the proportion of people who choose a closer exit route increases as the difference in distance between exit route starting points increases. Pedestrians’ choices in our data also depend on pedestrian density along routes, with people preferring less used routes. Our results thus confirm previously established route choice mechanisms and we can predict over 74\% of choices based on these factors. The qualitative agreement in results between the field study and the virtual experiment suggests that in simple route-choice scenarios, such as the one we investigate here, virtual experiments can be a valid experimental technique for studying pedestrian behavior. We therefore provide much-needed empirical support for the emerging paradigm of experiments in virtual environments.}

In our cyber-physical virtual testing environment, actual test vehicles and intersection control server at the physical layer interact with simulated vehicles in an implemented traffic microsimulation layer. The intersection control server continuously runs a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) that was previously proposed by authors for vehicle arrival scheduling at all-autonomous intersections with no physical traffic lights. In addition to the novel intersection traffic management scheme at the cyber layer, this VIL environment also includes a fuel consumption tracker that is based on our proposed fuel rate estimation methods using the basic vehicle diagnostic data. Using this environment, the mobility efficacy and the fuel consumption reduction potential of the proposed intersection control scheme are compared with two baseline scenarios in VIL experiments.}

The analysis is based on an analogy between the movement of shared bikes and the transmission of certain information on internet or the spreading of epidemics among humans. By mining a bike trip data set collected in the city, we find that (1) the distribution of bike trip distance peaks between 0.8 and 2 km, and beyond 6.3 km, it follows a strong power law; (2) the diffusion intensity of a community is affected positively by the number of incoming bike trips and rebalancing actions, and negatively by the percentage of inner-community trips. The effect of the rebalancing actions is roughly twice as strong as that of the incoming bike trips; (3) both the diffusion range of a bike and the number of rebalancing actions it receives are strong predictors of its use. Reaching one more community will produce about 14 more trips and an additional rebalancing action contributes about 8.6; and (4) even the most active bikes could only reach about 75\% of all communities in Chicago. The last finding helps identify a cluster of communities poorly connected with the rest of the city by bike travel. Interestingly, these isolated communities are strongly correlated with the areas of the city that have high concentration of African American population, low-income households and homicide crimes.}

Despite being essential for successful adoption, consumers’ motives regarding fully autonomous vehicles remain unclear. By collecting data from 25 in-depth laddering interviews in Germany and applying means-end chain analysis, we qualitatively explore the overarching motivational structures underlying consumers’ perception of autonomous driving with Level 5 automation. The results show three overarching motives: self-fulfillment, security and responsibility. Self-fulfillment relates to the meaningful utilization of disposable driving time for enhancing career success, nurturing social connections, and enhancing one’s quality of life. Security includes the desire for improvements in personal integrity and the fear of insufficient safety while driving fully autonomously. Responsibility expresses the longing to behave in a responsible manner and the fear of accountability for the actions of autonomous vehicles. Contrary to previous findings, the loss of driving pleasure, environmental, and ethical concerns have only secondary relevance. Considering these motivational patterns, we draw implications for managers and policy makers to facilitate market penetration and support a successful adoption of autonomous driving vehicles.}

In addition, the model is capable of taking multiple heterogeneously structured traffic data sources as input, such as parking meter transactions, traffic speed, and weather conditions.

One of the conceivable mobility services based on driverless cars is shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs). This service could merge cabs, carsharing, and ridesharing systems into a singular transportation mode. However, the success and competitiveness of future SAV services depend on their operational models, which are linked intrinsically to the service configuration and fleet specification. In addition, any change in operational models will result in a different demand. Using a comprehensive framework of SAV simulation in a multimodal dynamic demand system with integrated SAV user taste variation, this study evaluates the performance of various SAV fleets and vehicle capacities serving travelers across the Rouen Normandie metropolitan area in France. Also, the impact of ridesharing and rebalancing strategies on service performance is investigated. Research results suggest that the performance of SAV is strongly correlated with the fleet size and the strategy of individual or shared rides. Further analysis indicates that for the pricing scheme proposed in this study (i.e., 20\% lower for ridesharing scenario), the standard 4-seats car with shared ride remains the best option among all scenarios. The results also underline that enabling vehicle-rebalancing strategies may have an important effect on both user and service-related metrics. The estimated SAV average and maximum driven distance prove the importance of vehicle range and charging station deployment.}

First of all, the importance of monitoring vehicle dynamics states, especially the tire forces, is explained. Then the driving risk assessment criteria based on tire forces are developed in this work. The main contribution of this paper is the development of vehicle dynamics models and observers to estimate and predict individual tire forces using only low-cost sensors and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) map. The major new techniques developed in this study can be summarized in three aspects: (1) development of new vehicle dynamics models to estimate vertical, longitudinal, and lateral tire forces, (2) development of new nonlinear observers to minimize the estimation errors caused by sensor noises and model uncertainty, and (3) development of the tire forces prediction algorithm by taking advantage of digital map.

A decomposition-based heuristic is adopted to find a near-optimal solution to the MILP in a real-size network. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted using the VISSIM simulator to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme by comparing it with some existing approaches. Simulation results show that the timing plan derived from NMBSC can improve the network-level performance under both uniform and non-uniform demand patterns in terms of average delay and average number of stops.

Through considering the dynamic characteristics and transfer behaviors of passengers, an effective bi-objective integer linear programming model is formulated to characterize the passenger control process, in which the objectives are to minimize the total passenger waiting time and passenger accumulation risks at all the involved stations. To solve the proposed model conveniently, the above model is transformed into a single-objective model through reformulating the risk objective as a threshold-based constraint. Finally, two sets of numerical experiments, including a small-scale case and a real-world instance with operation data of the Beijing metro system, are implemented to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed approaches.}

abstract = {The rapid growth of transportation data offers new opportunities to analyze the interaction between travel behavior and transportation system performance, and particularly when issues such as uncertainty and reliability are considered. Many previous studies in this area described the stationary behavior of stochastic transportation systems using user equilibrium (UE) conditions. In contrast, this paper develops a generalized Bayesian model to analyze the dynamic behavior of stochastic transportation systems. In the proposed model, the variability of link volume and travel time stems from the stochasticity in travel demand, transportation supply (e.g. link capacity, free flow travel time, etc.) and route choice. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first work that considers the three sources of stochasticity simultaneously. In addition, we propose a Bayesian updating approach based on the Dirichlet model to describe the route choice behavior. This approach allows researchers to consider a wide range of route choice behavior of bounded rationality in day-to-day traffic dynamics, including a knowledge updating mechanism based on different memory lengths and weighting factors. This framework is particularly suitable for data-driven studies supported by emerging transportation data due to the computing efficiency of the Dirichlet-based Bayesian updating mechanism and the sound behavioral foundation. This paper shows that the proposed Bayesian model with infinite memory leads to UE conditions under stochastic demand and supply. Subsequently, a numerical case study is conducted to illustrate different day-to-day route choice dynamics with different memory lengths of system performance. This paper also discusses the influence of the three sources of stochasticity towards the aggregated variance of link volumes and travel time. With enough longitudinal travel choice and transportation system performance data, the proposed Bayesian framework could be empirically calibrated and tested, which offers an attractive descriptive alternative to the conventional UE-based transportation system models.}

Prospect Theory (PT) was originally developed to model decision making under risk, and later extended to CPT, which is also applicable to decision making under uncertainty. Travel time reliability is related to uncertainties in travel time, and its effect on travel behavior can be properly modeled using CPT. PT and CPT applications in transportation are mainly limited to experimental studies. This paper introduces a CPT-based framework for mode choice modeling using observational data. The framework can help travel demand modelers utilize CPT for modeling reliability in their trip-based or activity-based models, which are typically estimated from observational data (household travel surveys). To showcase model applications, the model parameters are estimated using a combination of revealed preference household travel survey data and empirically observed travel time data for a mode choice scenario in the Washington, D.C. area. We estimated the parameters of the utility function, the parameters of the CPT value function, and the parameters of the CPT weighting function and discussed how they imply diminishing sensitivity, risk-aversion in small probability losses, and risk-seeking in high-probability losses.

The former aims to estimate traffic flow on a single link with both filtered CL data, extracted spatio-temporal traffic features, and LPR data by incorporating the unique merits thereof. The latter is capable of estimating traffic flow on those links with only CL data by considering the spatial features of these links and relevant land-use information. Finally, case studies are analysed to demonstrate the impressive performance of the tailored machine learning approach.}

abstract = {The literature suggests that autonomous vehicles (AVs) may drastically change the user experience of private automobile travel by allowing users to engage in productive or relaxing activities while travelling. As a consequence, the generalised cost of car travel may decrease, and car users may become less sensitive to travel time. By facilitating private motorised mobility, AVs may eventually impact land use and households’ residential location choices. This paper seeks to advance the understanding of the potential impacts of AVs on travel behaviour and land use by investigating stated preferences for combinations of residential locations and travel options for the commute in the context of autonomous automobile travel. Our analysis draws from a stated preference survey, which was completed by 512 commuters from the Sydney metropolitan area in Australia and provides insights into travel time valuations in a long-term decision-making context. For the analysis of the stated choice data, mixed logit models are estimated. Based on the empirical results, no changes in the valuation of travel time due to the advent of AVs should be expected. However, given the hypothetical nature of the stated preference survey, the results may be affected by methodological limitations.}

abstract = {Knowledge of trip travel times serves an important role in transportation management and control. Existing travel time estimation approaches generally cover empirical ones, statistical ones and hybrid ones. Despite strong tractability, the empirical approaches cannot sufficiently capture diverse travel time distributions (TTDs) and often encounter some issues (e.g., assumption of a predefined distribution, failure of significance tests). Statistical and hybrid methods possess better generalization in estimating heterogeneous TTDs, but fail to model the network-wide spatiotemporal correlations, which have been found useful in the TTD estimation. To address these drawbacks, this paper proposes a deep learning based Trip Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Network (T-InfoGAN). In this method, the trip TTD is estimated by modeling the joint distribution of travel times of two successive links with the consideration of network-wide spatiotemporal correlations. Meanwhile, a dynamic clustering with Wasserstein distance (DCWD) algorithm is used to explore the traffic state transitions for link pairs and cluster the link pairs with similar TTDs into one group, which benefits the training and estimation processes of T-InfoGAN. Then, based on GPS trajectory data from Didi Chuxing in Chengdu city, China, numerical results show that the T-InfoGAN with DCWD can well estimate three mini trip TTDs with various features, and performs better than three other counterparts (i.e., Convolution method, MC-Grid method, and MC-GMMS method) in estimating the TTDs of two longer trips. In summary, this study is the first successful try to estimate trip TTDs within the framework of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and the deep learning based T-InfoGAN is a promising approach to estimate heterogeneous trip TTDs with the better generalization and flexibility in the big data era.}

Existing traffic flow prediction models mainly extract static spatial-temporal correlations, although these correlations are known to be dynamic in traffic networks. Attention-based models have emerged in recent years, mostly in the field of natural language processing, and have resulted in major progresses in terms of both accuracy and interpretability. This inspires us to introduce the application of attentions for traffic flow prediction. In this study, a deep learning based traffic flow predictor with spatial and temporal attentions (STANN) is proposed. The spatial and temporal attentions are used to exploit the spatial dependencies between road segments and temporal dependencies between time steps respectively. Experiment results with a real-world traffic dataset demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model. The results also show that the utilization of multiple data resolutions could help improve prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the proposed model is demonstrated to have potential for improving the understanding of spatial-temporal correlations in a traffic network.}

However, the early promises of ridesharing for alleviating congestion in cities may be undermined by a number of challenges, including the growing number of proposed services and the subsequent increasing number of vehicles, as a natural consequence of competition. In this work, we present optimization-based approaches to model cooperation and competition between multiple ridesharing companies, in a real-time on-demand setting. A recent trend relies on solving the integrated combination of Dial-A-Ride Problems (DARP), which compute the cost of assigning incoming requests to vehicle routes, plus Linear Assignment Problems (LAP), which assign vehicles to requests. While the DARPs, are solved at the level of the vehicles of each company, we introduce cooperative and competitive approaches to solve the LAP. The cooperative model, which could make use of Mobility as a Service platforms, is shown to solve the LAP to optimality following closely results from the literature, and limiting the amount of information the companies are required to share. We investigate how a realistic model of competition deviates from this optimality and provide worst case bounds. We evaluate these models with respect to a centralized model on one-week instances of the New York City taxi dataset. Model variants coping with noise in the travel time estimations, bias in the assignment costs, and preferences in the competitive case are also presented and validated. The computational results suggest that cooperation among ridesharing companies can be conducted in such a way to limit the degradation of the level of service with respect to a centralized model. Finally, we argue that the competition can lower the quality of the ridesharing service, especially in the case customer preferences are accommodated.}

The covariance mainly generated from the daily variation of travel patterns, network topology, and trip chaining activities of household members can be particularly high during the morning peak hour. With the increasing attention on the OD demand variance and covariance in stochastic road networks, a new criterion is proposed in this paper for measuring the estimation accuracy of OD demand covariance. The mathematical properties of this proposed criterion are analyzed to better understand the relationship between the estimation errors of mean and covariance of OD demands. This paper aims to investigate how to optimize the traffic count locations for minimizing the weighted maximum deviation of estimated mean and covariance of OD demands from the “true” values. To consider the effects of stochastic OD demands on the traffic count location problem in the proposed model, link choice proportions are regarded as stochastic variables and updated by an adapted traffic flow simulator in this study. Both the weighted-sum approach and bi-objective approach are examined with the adaption of the firefly algorithm (FA) to solve the single-objective and bi-objective problems. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effects, with and without considering the covariance of the OD demands for the optimization of traffic count locations.}

To provide an overview of the benefits and challenges brought by the trajectory data, we provide a survey on recent studies of trajectory analysis (refer to analyzing trajectory datasets) for on-demand services in this paper. Our purposes are at least trifold. First, we highlight the value of trajectory data in understanding on-demand services and discuss the procedures of retrieving information for the demand part and the supply part from raw trajectory data. Second, we categorize related studies into three parts (the demand part, the supply part, and the mixed part) and review the significant findings. For the demand part, we focus on the models proposed for describing and explaining the spatial-temporal characteristics of observed trips. Methods or models proposed for describing trip statistics, scaling laws of trips, and dynamics of ridership are reviewed. We summarize four types of factors that influence the spatial-temporal patterns of demands. For the supply part, we focus on the models proposed for describing the spatial-temporal characteristics of available taxis/ride-sharing cars and modeling the behavior of drivers (i.e., passenger-search behavior and route choice behavior) to explain the spatial-temporal patterns of taxi/ride-sharing supplies. For the mixed part, we focus on studies that apply the uncovered demands/supplies patterns to design recommendation systems and pricing strategies. Third, we discuss the future directions on collecting/releasing trajectory data and future research directions to advance the understanding of on-demand services.}

Therefore, this paper proposes a low-frequency probe vehicle data (PVD)-based method to identify turn-level intersection traffic congestion in an urban road network. This method initially divides an urban area into meter-scale square cells and maps PVD into those cells and then identifies the cells that correspond to road intersections by taking advantage of the fixed-location stop-and-go characteristics of traffic passing through intersections. With those rasterized road intersections, the proposed method recognizes probe vehicles’ turning directions and provides preliminary analysis of traffic conditions at all turning directions. The proposed method is map-independent (i.e., no digital map is needed) and computationally efficient and is able to rapidly screen most of the intersections for turn-level congestion in a road network. Thereby, this method is expected to greatly decrease traffic engineers’ workloads by providing information regarding where and when to investigate and solve traffic congestion problems.}

In turn, the results of these studies can be used to design policies and strategies that promote electrification of personal transportation. Any broader application of the results of these regional studies carries the implicit assumption that vehicle usage in the affected population is similar to that of population selected for the underlying usage study. Given this projection of behavior from one population onto others, replacement of the raw usage data with a statistical representation of the heterogeneity of vehicle usage should be equally valid while reducing elaborate studies of large data sets to just a few equations and spreadsheet calculations. We demonstrate this analytic approach in a study of the trade-off between increasing cost and convenience of incremental all-electric range (AER), and the cost of fast chargers needed whenever range is insufficient for a given day of travel. Three scenarios are considered: (1) A single range was assigned to all vehicles regardless of individual usage, (2) a common tolerance for the frequency of charging away from home was ascribed to all users and the range computed accordingly, and (3) the range that minimized the combined cost of batteries and electricity was computed for each vehicle. All three methods suggest optimal fleet-average range of approximately 175 km. However, both the frequency of visits to fast-charging stations and the energy drawn from those chargers is reduced by allowing users to choose the range that best matches their needs. For example, allowing a choice of range that results in a fleet average range of 200 km in place of a common fixed range of 200 km, the frequency of visits to fast chargers is reduced by 25\% and the energy drawn from those chargers is reduced by over 50\%. These results suggest that the total cost of universal BEV deployment can be reduced by allowing users to choose the BEV range that matches their needs.}

A large bus fleet, running entirely parallel to MRT lines, was deployed to ferry passengers between affected stations, which however results in prolonged congestion and queue of buses near terminals. Rail transit systems in many metropolitan areas are threatened because of aging infrastructure. This study, motivated by the Singapore case, proposes a novel parallel shuttle bus service design (PSBSD) problem that addresses route design, terminal selection, berth allocation, and bus deployment to minimize inconvenience caused to passengers, which is seldom addressed in previous studies. We further develop a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model for the PSBSD problem. In order to solve the non-convex MINLP model optimally, we put forward an effective decomposition method, which comprises (i) the generation of candidate shuttle bus routes through a brute-force search for semi-route and a terminal selection procedure and (ii) the deployment of buses and assignment of terminal berths for selected shuttle bus routes by using an optimization-based approach. Numerical experiments were conducted using data sets from the MRT closure incident in Singapore. The results demonstrate that the decomposition method is capable of finding optimal solutions. Useful insights are also obtained from testing the models under different scenarios.}

This paper investigates the contribution levels of 13 features of human driver's decision-making at USI using a random forest approach. Thirty skilled driver participants are tested in a real-time driving simulator where the traffic scenarios with merging vehicles were designed in different motion styles to mimic real traffic. The experiment results indicate that the relative distance and velocity between merging vehicles have a wider contribution range (i.e., −0.4 −0.4) than the absolute velocity and distance features (i.e., −0.2 −0.2) to predict driver behavior. The contribution also varies over the selected feature values and driving conditions. This contribution research gains insight in the influence of different variables on driver behavior prediction at USI, thereby assisting researchers in selecting representative features in self-driving applications.}

In the United States, policy regulating UAS operations exists at the federal, state, and local levels, but there is little to no regulation specifically related to UAS operations near roadways. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if UAS operations near roadways pose a safety concern by determining if the operations visually distract drivers. In addition, this study sought to develop data-driven policy recommendations to improve the safety of drivers and UAS operators near roadways. To understand how UAS operations near roadways influence the visual attention of drivers, an experiment was designed and conducted in a high-fidelity driving simulator. Thirty participants completed the experiment in the driving simulator and their visual attention was recorded. Analysis of the visual attention results showed that UAS operations draw more visual attention from drivers when they are directly adjacent to the roadside or in a rural environment. Based on the results, a recommended policy to improve safety of UASs for operators and drivers would be to, at a minimum, restrict UAS operations within 7.6 m (25 ft) of the edge of a lane. A procedural overview for implementing legal and effective UAS policy in the United States was developed to navigate the complexities of the evolving UAS policy landscape.}

To create lively public spaces, understanding various pedestrian behaviors has been increasing in importance. For example, we need to consider pedestrians’ behavior taking a detour to see beautiful scenery or stopping a walk to watch a street performance, in addition to usual goal-oriented behavior. Recent massive trajectory data from location-aware technologies, such as GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth technology, makes data-driven approaches promising. Inverse reinforcement learning, one of the data-driven approaches, is a powerful tool to infer the utility function with respect to points of interest (POI) from observed pedestrian trajectories. This approach can generate trajectories based on attractiveness of the open space with any POI distributions because the attractiveness is represented by the utility functions of the POIs. In this paper, we propose a two-step approach to generate the various trajectories. The first step infers the utility functions of the POIs and stochastic policy by inverse reinforcement learning, and the second step generates trajectories under the constraints on given destinations and arrival time. We numerically demonstrated that our approach generated not only goal-oriented but also detour-and-pause behaviors under given destination and time constraints in two types of environments representing an open public space.}

This paper presents a flexible framework to automatically extract these interaction patterns from observed temporal sequences based on driving primitives. A Bayesian nonparametric approach is developed to segment vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) sequential observations into small analytically interpretable components (called driving primitives) without using prior knowledge. Then, an unsupervised clustering method is developed to gather these driving primitives into groups (called driving patterns) by integrating with dynamic time warping. In addition, the extracted driving primitives are used to quantitatively analyze the similarities between behaviors at different intersections using a relative entropy metric, i.e., KullbackLeibler (KL) divergence. Finally, 706 naturalistic V2V events from eight typical urban signalized intersections are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed primitive-based framework. Experimental results demonstrate that there exist 15 types of interactive driving patterns for V2V behaviors at intersections in our database. Moreover, the distribution of interactive driving patterns could characterize the types of intersections.}

abstract = {Applications in intelligent transportation systems may not function properly due to loss of positioning precision or reliability in certain GPS-denied environment, e.g., underground parking lots, street surrounded by tall buildings, tunnels, etc. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes a new video-based vehicle ego-positioning method for intelligent transportation applications. Our method follows the procedure of finding feature correspondences from consecutive frames and minimizing its re-projection error. Firstly, we propose an image singular value decomposition algorithm to mitigate the impact of picture blurring. Secondly, a statistic filter of feature space displacement and a circle matching method are proposed to screen or prune potential matched features so as to remove the outliers caused by the mismatching. Thirdly, experiments are conducted on a benchmark dataset KITTI and real outdoor and indoor image data with blur, weak texture or illumination changes to verify the validation of the proposed algorithm. Lastly, the proposed algorithm is successfully applied to indoor parking guidance. The results demonstrate that compared with other state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed video-based vehicle ego-positioning scheme has more precise and reliable performance with a lower cost, which provides an appropriate way for indoor parking guidance.}

However, these air emissions data are modeled, rather than directly measured, so we are cautious about causal interpretations, and uncertainty in the effects of TNC entry on travel distances and gasoline consumption suggests potential additional externality effects that could dominate the air emissions effect.}

Indeed, using autonomous public transport vehicles (APTVs) prudently can result in significant improvements in the reliability, efficiency, and attractiveness of PT. The lack of human drivers and the feasible control strategies of the APTVs make it possible to offer a reliable, efficient and attractive service that can handle, in real time, the fluctuations in passenger demand. This work assumes that the APTVs of a single line are controlled centrally and are responsive to real-time requests from passengers. As the result, a real-time schedule can be constructed and communicated to the passengers. However, during the actual operations, the real-time demand will be fluctuated entailing schedule adjustments. These adjustments are optimized in this work using two operational strategies for the APTVs: holding and speed changing. The solution methodology proposed is based on time-space graphical techniques using multi-criteria decision analysis to minimize schedule changes as the primary objective, as well as to reduce travel time and active energy consumption. Two multi-objective models are developed for not-considered and considered vehicle capacity and then examined using a simulation framework. A case study from Auckland, New Zealand, is selected, which assumes that ordinary buses are replaced with APTVs. The results indicate that the strategy-based optimal schedule adjustments achieve a 100\% elimination of schedule deviations compared with 33-minute and 13-minute deviations for the low-demand and high-demand scenarios of the ordinary PT service, respectively. The results of the simulated case study indicate that the incorporation of APTVs, along with prudent control, can result in a more attractive PT service.}

A composite similarity measure is developed for each link in the network as a weighted average of a density similarity measure (ensuring homogeneity) and a distance similarity measure (ensuring connectivity and compactness). The resulting similarity matrix is fed into a graph clustering method termed symmetric nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) to bi-partition the network. To determine the optimal weight as a hyperparameter, we propose a hierarchical search algorithm (HSA) based on the concept of “knee” that is used to find the most significant solution from the Pareto front. The proposed approach is demonstrated on the Melbourne network using a simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment model. Results show that the methodology (i) can effectively capture the spatial variations of the congestion pattern in the network; (ii) is robust to moderate parameter changes; (iii) can be extended to the time-dependent case and hence inform when to activate the area control; and (iv) can perform relatively well in the presence of missing data. When varying the distance threshold as a design parameter, we can observe how the optimal RZ evolves in space, a feature that is critical to devising a double- or multi-layered RZ for hierarchical control purposes.}

The AMAN assists the air traffic controller in facilitating efficient arrival sequences and arrival times to ensure smooth arrival traffic. Although the aircraft sequencing problem that optimizes the arrival sequence has already been studied for the AMAN algorithm, the AMAN algorithm must also optimize aircraft trajectories to accommodate trajectory-based operations. This study proposes a novel AMAN algorithm based on the merging optimization method. Although the merging optimization method can simultaneously optimize the arrival sequence and trajectory, it cannot be easily applied to a realistic AMAN algorithm. Thus, the receding horizon approach is employed here to apply the merging optimization method to the AMAN algorithm. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed AMAN algorithm, numerical simulations are conducted. Actual radar data are used to conduct realistic air traffic simulations and evaluate the AMAN algorithm. A conventional AMAN algorithm is also simulated for comparison. Simulation results show that the proposed AMAN algorithm reduces both the total flight time and fuel consumption of all aircraft compared with the conventional AMAN algorithm. Furthermore, the proposed AMAN algorithm reveals the trade-off relationship between the minimization of flight time and fuel consumption.}

This approach not only outperforms the recently developed real-time estimation of lane-based queue lengths but also captures the spatiotemporal attributes of traffic. There are three primary challenges to design a deep learning based queue estimation model. First, the CNN and the LSTM are integrated to estimate lane-based queue lengths minimizing accumulative counting errors. Furthermore, short-term arrival patterns and long-term traffic demand trends are captured by the LSTM to improve the accuracy of estimates of cycle-based proportional lane-uses. In addition, imaged second-based occupancy rates and impulse memories are used to identify whether vehicular queues are remained at the end of each cycle by using the CNN. In numerical examples and case study, the integrated CNN – LSTM method shows excellent performance to estimate queue lengths in individual lanes in seconds compared to the other approaches applied in this paper. This work paves the way for the applicability of the deep learning to estimate traffic quantities in real-time for lane-based adaptive traffic control systems (ATCS). Furthermore, we will introduce offset in a signal plan and lane-based turning proportion on the proposed framework to explain vehicular spillbacks in an individual lane and a grid lock for pursuing coordinated traffic movements along arterials and in signalized urban networks.}

Due to the existence of mutual influence of neighboring intersections, cycle-by-cycle estimation of queue length under spillover conditions remains a challenging problem given low-resolution detector data. On most urban arterials in China, point detectors are commonly installed at the intersection approaches and the upstream segments, providing volume, occupancy and speed data at a time interval of 1 min, i.e., a double-section low-resolution detection environment. Thus, the objective of this study is to propose a method to estimate the cycle-based queue length at signalized intersections considering spillover in the context of the above detection environment. Considering dense traffic conditions, uniform distribution is used to transform the low-resolution volume data into vehicle arrivals in 1 s. To deal with spillover conditions, mutual effects of neighboring intersections are classified into four different cases, based on the offsets between the neighboring intersections. Detector data at the upstream intersection approach are used to modify the volume data of the downstream intersection when long queue occurs, and the effect of spillover can thus be formulated analytically using the shockwave theory. Finally, the queue length can be calculated by accumulating queue lengths of all offset conditions within a cycle. Evaluation is done through an empirical case of two intersections, and a simulation case of seven intersections. Results show that the accuracy can reach 85.1\% and 82.4\% respectively. In both cases, spillover cycles can be recognized with stable and reliable performance.}

Well-structured transit TDM approaches can help agencies better manage the available system capacity when the opportunity and investment to expand are limited. However, transit systems are complex and the design of a TDM scheme, deciding when, where, and how much discount or surcharge is implemented, is not trivial. The paper proposes a general framework for the optimal design of promotion based TDM strategies in urban rail systems. The framework consists of two major components: network performance and optimization. The network performance model updates the origin-destination (OD) demand based on the response to the promotion strategy, assigns it to the network, and estimates performance metrics. The optimization model allocates resources to maximize promotion performance in a cost effective way by better targeting users whose behavioral response to the promotion improves system performance. The optimal design of promotion strategies is facilitated by the availability of smart card (automated fare collection, AFC) data. The proposed approach is demonstrated with data from a busy urban rail system. The results illustrate the value of the method, compare the effectiveness of different strategies, and highlight the limits of the effectiveness of such strategies.}

Four features are selected to generate an image for each taxi, namely, the cruising speed, the cruising ratio, the difference in demand-supply ratios and the next passenger trip distance. These features can be easily computed for each taxi search trip using widely available data sources. Sparse subspace clustering (SSC), an unsupervised learning algorithm, is introduced to identify search strategies embedded in the hunting images. The proposed methodology is experimented on a large-scale taxi trajectory dataset collected in Shenzhen, China across five months in 2016. Twenty four clusters corresponding to different search strategies are identified from 885 taxis. The differences in search strategies are linked to the operational efficiency and profitability of individual taxis. The results also reveal common search patterns in the taxi market of Shenzhen. Specifically, we find most taxis: (1) prefer to cruise in the same region after dropping off the last passenger; (2) have trouble finding passenger at midnight and early in the morning; and (3) tend to gather at the ports between Shenzhen and Hong Kong during peak periods to serve short-distance trips.}

In this paper we introduce a comprehensive optimization-based decision making tool to support such transitions. More precisely, we present a fleet replacement problem which allows organizations to determine bus replacement plans that will meet their fleet electrification targets in a cost-effective way, namely considering purchase costs, salvage revenues, operating costs, charging infrastructure investments, and demand charges. We account for several charging infrastructure options, such as slow and fast plug-in stations, overhead pantograph chargers, and inductive (wireless) chargers.

abstract = {This paper presents a trajectory planning strategy for connected automated vehicles (CAVs) to cooperatively carry out mainline facilitating (i.e. gap development) and on-ramp merging maneuvers. The trajectory planning tasks of the mainline facilitating vehicle and the merging vehicle are formulated as two related optimal control problems. The motivation behind the proposed strategy is to restrain a facilitating maneuver’s impact on following traffic. To this end, the proposed strategy bounds the speed of the facilitating maneuver from below and meanwhile ensures that the task of gap development can still be fulfilled. Because of the existence of the speed bound, the optimal control problem of the facilitating vehicle becomes constrained in state, in addition to the control constraints. A Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) with state constraints is applied to rigorously derive the analytical solution. The main difficulty of the analytical procedure exists in the fact that the first-order necessary condition on the extremality of the Hamiltonian cannot yield useful information on the property of the optimal control history with regard to making the optimal speed trajectory to satisfy the speed constraint. As a result, additional conditions have to be explored, notably the so-called “jump conditions”, among others. Taking advantage of the analytical solution, the proposed strategy is then implemented under a model predictive control framework. Simulation assessments of the proposed strategy are conducted at two levels – individual vehicle level and traffic flow level. At the individual vehicle level, the proposed strategy shows potential to reduce the risk of rear-end collision between the facilitating vehicle and the following vehicle, the most vulnerable pair of vehicles under the influence of gap development. At the traffic flow level, coupled with Aimsun, the proposed strategy is assessed under mixed traffic flow conditions, with various penetration rates of CAVs. The results show that it has potential to generate lower speed variations of traffic flow, a critical factor in traffic flow safety. Meanwhile it does not show negative impact on traffic efficiency in the simulation, and is likely to improve traffic efficiency in the real world. A sensitivity analysis of the effect of the facilitating maneuver’s lower speed bound is also conducted. Although there exist several limitations with this study, it sheds some light on future research.}

Different ordered combinations of emergencies result in different performance outcomes. Even though future events can be anticipated, previous studies follow an assumption that events over a time interval are independent. This study follows an assumption that events are interdependent, because speed reduction and rubbernecking due to an initial incident provoke secondary incidents on freeways and the resource availability depends on service times of each request. The misconception that secondary incidents are not common has resulted in overlooking a look-ahead concept. This study is the pioneer in relaxing the structural assumptions of independency during the assignment of servers and approaching the challenge from an operational perspective, online optimization. The main objective is to minimize the time needed to respond to a sequence of requests. We introduce online dispatching strategies with visualization applied in different network sizes, number of requests, and service times to provide insights on model behavior and solution quality. The experimental evidence indicates that the algorithm works well in practice. We envision a new era in which an optimal resource allocation adapts to external events effectively and anticipates the future learning from the past to produce effective solutions.}

We investigate the problem of optimal integration of SAVs with transit. By optimal, we mean that transit should be used instead of or to complement SAVs only when it reduces the total system travel time. Although greater use of transit reduces congestion, transit often increases travel time due to frequent stops and transfers. By using a continuous approximation to passenger and vehicle movements, we formulate the problem as a linear program using the link transmission model for traffic flow. One of the main challenges is associating passenger movement with vehicles that can have different destinations (e.g. a transit stop). Although the mathematical program is linear, it nevertheless has a large number of variables. We find a suboptimal solution using a rolling horizon method, which greatly reduces the required computation time. We also demonstrate an example of a possibly unfair passenger-to-vehicle ordering, and propose a first-come-first-served greedy algorithm to match passengers. A suite of experimental results on the Sioux Falls network show that using transit decreases total system travel time, especially when SAV fleet sizes are small. Transit also decreases the time travelers spend waiting, but tends to increase in-vehicle travel time. The methodology could be useful both for future SAV operators and for planners seeking to predict the effects of SAVs on traffic congestion.}

However, it cannot account for First-In-First-Out violation among vehicles on multi-lane roads. In this study, we present an extension of the model in the Lagrangian coordinates. In particular, we define a new variable of a vehicle’s order as its corresponding cumulative flows at different times and locations. The new kinematic wave model is consistent at the aggregate level with Newell’s simplified kinematic wave model, but allows for FIFO violation among individual vehicles. Based on the new model, we then present two algorithms to estimate vehicles’ trajectories from Eulerian data (cumulative flows provided by loop detectors) and Lagrangian data (the vehicle’s entry and exit times provided by reidentification technologies) at two boundaries of a road segment. In the first algorithm, we assume that vehicles follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle on a multi-lane road, and their orders are constant and equal the average of the entry and exit orders; in the second algorithm, we introduce a linear order-changing model to interpolate a vehicle’s orders at different times according to its entry and exit times. With Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) datasets, we demonstrate that both algorithms are effective, but the second one, with an estimation error of around 10\%, greatly outperforms the first one, with an estimation error of around 13\%. This verifies the advantage of incorporating FIFO violation in the new model.}

For the wide-track experiment, we examined global densities as high as 9 ped/m2. Our main findings were as follows. (i) The middle section of our unidirectional fundamental diagram exhibited a clear similarity to that of a single-file pedestrian flow, which enabled us to distinguish two different kinds of congested pedestrian flow. (ii) The unidirectional fundamental diagram for a high-density situation was quantitatively nearly the same as that observed in the empirical data. (iii) In the absence of a bottleneck, typical stop-and-go patterns did not emerge in the unidirectional flow on the 1.5-m track. Instead, some high-density clusters propagating downstream can be observed. (iv) In the bidirectional flow experiments, three different lane formation processes were observed. The processes were quite quick, even under very dense conditions. (v) When three lanes formed, the bidirectional flow rate was much larger than the unidirectional flow rate due to the inhomogeneous distribution of pedestrians across different lanes. (vi) At high densities, the unidirectional and bidirectional flow rates were nearly the same. However, a bottleneck emerged in the bidirectional flow due to the variable width of the opposite streams. Our study helps to achieve a better understanding and modeling of the dynamics of high-density pedestrian flows.}

abstract = {Recent years have seen an increase in reported unmanned aerial systems (UAS) incursion into terminal airspace, likely due to the ease of access to recreational UAS to the general public with minimal understanding of aviation regulations. Such incursions often lead to extensive airport shutdowns due to safety concern and could cause a cascading disruption to airline operations throughout the region. A better assessment tool for the collision risk between the existing air traffic and such non-cooperative intruder could help reduce unnecessary disruption while maintaining safety to air traffic operations. While advancements have been made in the past decade in detection and avoidance of UAS traffics, the systems depend on either having fully cooperative traffic or sensor capability beyond what is currently available. This paper seeks to assess the collision risk posed by an intruding UAS within the airport-restricted “terminal airspace,” in the Singapore context, with minimal information on the UAS. This was done through probabilistic conflict prediction with Monte-Carlo simulations under the assumption of a worst-case scenario involving a non-cooperative intruder traveling directly towards the flight corridor. Alert Zones within the existing 5 km terminal airspace could be constructed using the collision prediction models to help air traffic controllers quickly identifying UAS that poses a threat under most circumstances, with the information passed on to the pilot for mitigation actions. Simulations were conducted for a number of conflict-pairs to investigate how the resulting Alert Zones differ. Finally, this paper also investigates how the incorporation of UAS tracking information, under the current reliability level, could be used to augment the collision prediction algorithm and its effect on the management of collision risks in terminal airspace. The result suggested that the method that utilizes the most available information for UAS path modeling could be used with the currently available sensors to produce acceptable collision prediction results.}

With the population of connected vehicles and intelligent mobility, high-resolution trajectory data provide new possibilities for signal control evaluation and optimization. Therefore, the objective of this study is to propose a new arterial coordination control model for two-way arterial progression solely using sampled trajectories. Sampled trajectories are first used to extract prior arrival information and queuing states. Then, vehicle arrival time at the stop-line at each intersection is estimated as the function of signal timing parameters and prior arrival rates based on the shockwave theory, considering different sampled trajectory statuses. The delay of each sample vehicle is thus obtained as the difference between the actual arrival time and the projected arrival time. Sum of the delays of all the sampled trajectories ever travelling on the mainline of the arterial is selected to be the optimization objective, and the optimization problem is solved through a multi-sub-swarm Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. A simulation model is built to test the performance of the proposed model compared with the Synchro model and the MULTIBAND model under various demand scenarios. Results show that the performance of the proposed method is relatively satisfactory, which demonstrates that the optimization of fixed-time arterial coordination control solely using sample trajectories is feasible.}

The last is defined based on a set of driving analytics (e.g. distance travelled, speed, accelerations, braking, cornering and smartphone usage) collected using an innovative data collection scheme, which is based on the continuous recording of driving behavior analytics in real time, using smartphone device sensors. Safety efficiency is examined in terms of speed limit violation, driving distraction, aggressiveness and safety on urban, rural and highway road and in an overall model. DEA models are identifying the most efficient drivers that lie on the efficiency frontier and act as peers for the rest of the non-efficient drivers. The proposed methodological framework is tested on data from fifty-six (56) drivers during a 7-months period. Findings help distinguish the most efficient drivers from those that are less efficient. Moreover, the efficient level of inputs and outputs to switch from non-efficiency to the efficiency frontier is identified. Results also provide a potential for classification of the driving sample based on drivers’ comparative safety efficiency. The main characteristics of the most and less efficient drivers are consequently analyzed and presented. Most common inefficient driving practices are identified (aggressive, risky driving, etc.) and driving behavior is comparatively evaluated and analyzed.}

If these estimates are not accurate, the level of service is degraded, as the promised time window may not be satisfied. The purpose of this work is to assess the feasibility of machine learning techniques to predict stop delivery times. This is done by testing a wide range of machine learning techniques (including different types of ensembles) to (1) predict the stop delivery time and (2) to determine whether the total stop delivery time will exceed a predefined time threshold (classification approach). For the assessment, all models are trained using information generated from GPS data collected in Medellín, Colombia and compared to hazard duration models. The results are threefold. First, the assessment shows that regression-based machine learning approaches are not better than conventional hazard duration models concerning absolute errors of the prediction of the stop delivery times. Second, when the problem is addressed by a classification scheme in which the prediction is aimed to guide whether a stop time will exceed a predefined time, a basic K-nearest-neighbor model outperforms hazard duration models and other machine learning techniques both in accuracy and F1 score (harmonic mean between precision and recall). Third, the prediction of the exact duration can be improved by combining the classifiers and prediction models or hazard duration models in a two level scheme (first classification then prediction). However, the improvement depends largely on the correct classification (first level).}

The proposed model considers the arrangement (order) of AVs and NVs in the mixed stream and the expected, the lowest, and the highest achievable headways and their variability are analytically derived. Moreover, the total delay of a two-lane road with interrupted traffic flow is analytically modeled for various possible lane allocation policies: (a) dedicated lanes, (b) mixed-mixed lanes, (c) mixed-NV lanes, and (d) mixed-AV lanes.

However, the AVI observations are too sparse to infer the specific chosen route and OD pair, which discourages its application on route choice model estimation. To tackle this issue, this paper develops a semi-supervised learning method that can train the route choice model with sparse AVI observations. First of all, the likelihood function in Maximum Likelihood Estimation procedure was derived by decomposing the AVI trace into observation pairs. Combined with high-resolution GPS observations, the measurement equation and OD inference model were then defined to deal with the sparsity problem of AVI observations. At the same time, the Mixed Logit model was introduced to capture the correlation and heterogeneity across the choice behavior between different observation pairs. Finally, the relationship between route choice model and the likelihood function was established and the unknown parameters in route choice model can be estimated by seeking a maximum to the log-likelihood function. Empirical studies were conducted with field-testing data in this paper. The estimated results show that the proposed semi-supervised method improved the identification accuracy of route choice model significantly without sacrificing interpretability. The evaluation of the computational efficiency presented the potential of the semi-supervised method to learn route choice behavior for a large-size sample set. The sensitivity analysis was also performed to illustrate how robust the proposed method is. This is the first research that attempts to apply AVI data on route choice model and it endows the high-penetration AVI data with great practical value for modeling the route choice behavior of city-wide samples over a long period.}

Over the past decade, numerous methods for MVRPSTW have been proposed, but most are based on heuristic rules that require a large amount of computation time. With the current rapid increase of logistics demands, traditional methods incur the dilemma between computational efficiency and solution quality. To efficiently solve the problem, we propose a novel reinforcement learning algorithm called the Multi-Agent Attention Model that can solve routing problem instantly benefit from lengthy offline training. Specifically, the vehicle routing problem is regarded as a vehicle tour generation process, and an encoder-decoder framework with attention layers is proposed to generate tours of multiple vehicles iteratively. Furthermore, a multi-agent reinforcement learning method with an unsupervised auxiliary network is developed for the model training. By evaluated on four synthetic networks with different scales, the results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms Google OR-Tools and traditional methods with little computation time. In addition, we validate the robustness of the well-trained model by varying the number of customers and the capacities of vehicles.}

This paper considers the joint routing, battery charging, and pricing problem faced by a profit-maximizing transportation service provider that operates a fleet of autonomous electric vehicles. We first establish the static planning problem by considering time-invariant system parameters and determine the optimal static policy. While the static policy provides stability of customer queues waiting for rides even if consider the system dynamics, we see that it is inefficient to utilize a static policy as it can lead to long wait times for customers and low profits. To accommodate for the stochastic nature of trip demands, renewable energy availability, and electricity prices and to further optimally manage the autonomous fleet given the need to generate integer allocations, a real-time policy is required. The optimal real-time policy that executes actions based on full state information of the system is the solution of a complex dynamic program. However, we argue that it is intractable to exactly solve for the optimal policy using exact dynamic programming methods and therefore apply deep reinforcement learning to develop a near-optimal control policy. The two case studies we conducted in Manhattan and San Francisco demonstrate the efficacy of our real-time policy in terms of network stability and profits, while keeping the queue lengths up to 200 times less than the static policy.}

The aim of EETC is to minimize total traction energy consumption of a train run given the running time in the timetable. Most research is focused to apply mechanical braking on this problem. However, current trains are able to use regenerative braking, which leads to another optimal driving strategy compared to mechanical braking. Research on EETC with a realistic nonlinear bounded model for regenerative braking or a combination between regenerative and mechanical braking is limited. The aim of this paper is to compare the difference between the EETC with regenerative and/or mechanical braking. First, we derive the optimal control structure for the problems with different braking combinations. Second, we apply the pseudospectral method on different scenarios where we investigate the effect of varying speed limits and gradients on the different driving strategies. Results indicate that compared to pure mechanical braking, combined regenerative and mechanical braking leads to a driving strategy with higher energy savings, a lower optimal cruising speed, a shorter coasting phase and a higher speed at the beginning of the braking phase. In addition, a nonlinear bounded regenerative braking curve leads to a different driving strategy compared to a constant braking rate that is commonly used in literature. We show that regenerative braking at a constant braking rate overestimates the total energy savings.}

abstract = {Bus operations on arterials are often hindered by traffic signals and car queues. Transit signal priority (TSP) strategies can be used to improve bus operations on arterials. Analytically quantifying the impacts of TSP in mixed traffic, where cars and buses share lanes, is challenging since car queues can slow down buses, while slow-moving buses can create bottlenecks for cars. Furthermore, computational costs increase significantly when considering an arterial with multiple intersections. To tackle these challenges, this paper first develops a dynamic programming framework to model and evaluate TSP along an arterial. Next, the algorithm is utilized to determine the changes to car and bus delays as a result of TSP implementation along an arterial, and the sensitivity of the algorithm to the signal timing plan, bus stop locations and dwell durations, and the bus headway is evaluated. Next, a bi-level optimization framework is proposed to determine the optimal location of TSP implementation along arterials. Finally, the results of integrating TSP with dedicated bus lanes is evaluated. The results suggest that the benefits of TSP largely depend on the signal setting, and bus stop location, and that as the bus headway decreases, the marginal benefit of providing TSP also decreases. Additionally, the results suggest that the specific intersection at which TSP is implemented can play a large role on its operational impacts. Finally, it is found that in some scenarios, the benefits of implementing TSP alone can be larger than implementing dedicated bus lanes alone.}

abstract = {Lane-changing manoeuvre is one of the risky manoeuvres performed by drivers either to reach the planned destination (i.e., mandatory lane-changing; MLC) or to achieve better driving conditions (i.e., discretionary lane-changing; DLC). Essentially both lane-changing types require the driver to acquire surrounding traffic information for efficient and safe lane-changing decisions. However, this does not discount the fact that both these lane-changings are fundamentally different from each other as the urgency of lane-changing is much higher during MLC compared to DLC. Real-time driving aids in a connected environment promise to assist during the lane-changing decision-making process, but the differential effectiveness (or usefulness) of real-time driving aids in a connected environment for these two lane-changing types remains unexplored due to the novelty of a connected environment and the consequent scarcity of data. To fill this research gap, this study collected lane-changing data from 78 participants who performed MLC and DLC in the CARRS-Q Advanced Driving Simulator. Participants were asked to drive in three randomised driving conditions: baseline condition (without driving aids), real-time driving aids in a connected environment with perfect communication, and delayed driving aids in a connected environment. While surrogate measures of safety are analysed and compared using descriptive statistics, a hybrid framework of data mining and classical statistical modelling is employed to examine the usefulness of the real-time driving aids in a connected environment for two lane-changing types. We find that the crash risk associated with MLC is significantly reduced in the driving conditions providing driving aids compared to that of DLC. Results also reveal that the probability of engaging in a hard-braking event decreases for both the lane-changing types in the presence of real-time driving aids in the connected environment driving conditions, but a higher decrease in magnitude is found for MLC. Age and gender-related differential impact have been observed where young and male drivers have a higher possibility of engaging in a hard-braking event when driving without driving aids, but the presence of real-time driving aids reduces such risk. This study concludes that the usefulness (or effectiveness) of the real-time driving aids in a connected environment is a function of the urgency of a task, which is evidently higher during MLC, thus providing the maximum advantage during MLC.}

Second, different combinations of these input variables were analyzed with the principal component analysis.

abstract = {In recent years, there has been a tremendous change in the landscape of mobility offerings with the introduction with the introduction of Uber and Lyft, companies collectively known as Transportation Network Companies (TNCs), otherwise known as ridesourcing companies. Due to the nascency of these companies, there is a small but rapidly growing body of literature on the impacts these TNCs are having on traditional forms of shared ride modes, however, most of the emerging literature centers on the relationships between TNC and only one other shared mode of transportation (e.g. TNCs and Public Transit). This research attempts to contribute to the literature by examining the relationship between TNCs and multiple shared ride modes simultaneously. To this end, a joint modeling framework was used to study New York City ridership data for TNCs, taxi services, bikesharing, and the subway from January 2015 to June 2017. The goal of the research presented is two-fold: explore the dynamic relationships between TNCs and other modes of shared ridership, as well as to build a predictive model for the daily ridership usage for each modal offering and total daily ridership usage. To accomplish these tasks, we first used a compositional time series approach in which the four series are modeled as proportions of total daily demand and then, after a suitable transformation, jointly modeled them via a vector autoregression with exogenous predictors (VARX) to account for trend, a weekly seasonal structure, and exogenous predictors. The second part of our analysis involved modeling the daily total usage of the four modes using a dynamic linear model (DLM) and then using that model to draw inferences about the total ridership in NYC. Results of the models were then combined to produce medium-term forecasts for each modal ridership. Our findings corroborate those of others in investigating correlations over time between usage of TNCs and taxis in servicing consumers. In keeping with our second goal, this analysis demonstrates that our modeling framework may be useful for forecasting several competing types of shared ride modes in New York City.}

In the proposed formulation, activity-travel pattern (ATP) choice elements including the choices of activity, activity sequence, mode, departure time, and parking location, are all unified into a time-dependent ATPs generator. The proposed model accounts for the dynamicity of the network, including time-of-day and congestion effects in a joint structure for transport supply and demand. Moreover, the proposed TPMS explicitly formulates an operating capacitated public transport system. To allow visiting locations multiple times and to alleviate the complexity of the proposed model, a novel multi-visit vehicle routing problem is proposed which does not enumerate the node and link visits. In order to calibrate the model based on the major travel attributes of the travel survey data, a set of splitting ratios are introduced to distribute trips on the network. The model uses the splitting ratios to integrate the ATPs generator and the traffic assignment (TA) model in a unified TPMS structure. The effectiveness of the proposed structure is demonstrated through numerical examples provided.}

abstract = {Ridesourcing services provide alternative mobility options in several cities. Their market share has grown exponentially due to the convenience they provide. The use of such services may be associated with car-light or car-free lifestyles. However, there are growing concerns regarding their impact on urban transportation operations performance due to empty, unproductive miles driven without a passenger (commonly referred to as deadheading). This paper is motivated by the potential to reduce deadhead mileage of ridesourcing trips by providing drivers with information on future ridesourcing trip demand. Future demand information enables the driver to wait in place for the next rider’s request without cruising around and contributing to congestion. A machine learning model is employed to predict hourly and 10-minute future interval travel demand for ridesourcing at a given location. Using future demand information, we propose algorithms to (i) assign drivers to act on received demand information by waiting in place for the next rider, and (ii) match these drivers with riders to minimize deadheading distance. Real-world data from ridesourcing providers in Austin, TX (RideAustin) and Chengdu, China (DiDi Chuxing) are leveraged. Results show that this process achieves 68\%–82\% and 53\%–60\% reduction of trip-level deadheading miles for the RideAustin and DiDi Chuxing sample operations respectively, under the assumption of unconstrained availability of short-term parking. Deadheading savings increase slightly as the maximum tolerable waiting time for the driver increases. Further, it is observed that significant deadhead savings per trip are possible, even when a small percent of the ridesourcing driver pool is provided with future ridesourcing demand information.}

Different types of roads with traffic facilities provide multi-source heterogeneous field traffic data, which contain the fundamental information and distinct features for congestion recognition. To exploit these traffic big data, in this paper, we propose a machine learning-based framework to tackle the congestion recognition problem. It can be divided in two parts, a digraph-based representation for hybrid urban traffic network and a Dirgraph Convolutional Neural Network (DGCN)-based learning model. At first, the representation incorporates the fundamental traffic variables with the correlation of different traffic flows, and partially decouples the global network topology from local traffic information. And then, to proceed with digraph-based samples, a new type of graph feature extraction method is introduced and the graph Fourier transform is defined accordingly. This distinguishes the proposed model from the conventional graph convolutional networks. Comprehensive experiments are conducted based on real traffic data. The results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed framework over the existing congestion recognition methods.}

Being heterogeneity a major source of uncertainty, to correctly frame the proposed validation methodology we have first reviewed and adapted cross-disciplinary theoretical concepts about uncertainty modelling to traffic simulation. A number of open issues, including error compensation and model overfitting, has been interpreted and clarified through the proposed framework. A two-level probabilistic approach has been applied to run stochastic simulations of three NGSIM I-80 traffic scenarios, and quantitatively infer the impact of heterogeneity. According to this approach, both the car-following and the lane-changing models of each vehicle have been calibrated against observed trajectories. Based on the estimated parameters distributions, different models of heterogeneity have been quantitatively validated against macroscopic traffic patterns. Being traffic a collective phenomenon emerging from microscopic interactions, even models calibrated on microscopic trajectories need to be quantitatively validated on macroscopic traffic patterns too. Among other results, normal distributions of the model parameters, which are customarily applied in traffic simulation practice, have been found unable to reproduce the observed congestion patterns. Parameters correlation, being claimed as highly influential in previous works, is responsible for a model overfitting in traffic scenarios with low congestion. In the end, it has been demonstrated that a thorough characterization of parameters heterogeneity cannot be left out in traffic simulation, if an ersatz representation of traffic is to be avoided.}

An optimal control problem has been formulated and solved in order to generate a set of candidate CDO trajectories per aircraft, while a mixed-integer-linear programming model has been built in order to optimally assign routes of the arrival procedure and required times of arrival (RTAs) to the arriving traffic when still in cruise. The assessment has been performed for Frankfurt am Main airport (Germany), by using arrival traffic gathered from historical data. Results show that, after assigning an RTA and a route to every arriving aircraft, it is possible to maximize the number of aircraft performing CDOs while ensuring a safe time separation throughout the arrival procedure. For low traffic scenarios, the totality of traffic can be successfully scheduled, while for high traffic scenarios this is not the case and not all aircraft can be scheduled if neutral CDOs are flown. However, by assuming different arbitrarily defined arrival times to the TMA or by considering more additional shortcuts in the trombone procedure it is possible to increase the number of aircraft scheduled. Besides improving current operations in the short-mid term, the methodology presented in this paper could become a technical enabler towards a fully deployed trajectory based operations (TBO) environment.}

It is also not uncommon for the problems to be further decomposed by direction since the use of tracks is usually direction specific in a high-speed network. In this paper, we consider the optimization problem of integrating re-timetabling and re-routing decisions within station areas for multiple stations when scheduled maintenance renders the existing, optimized schedules infeasible. We model the underlying problems using a space–time network on a mesoscopic level and propose a 0–1 binary integer programming model that can simultaneously modify the timings and routes of trains from different directions. Two different solution approaches are described. The first is a commonly used Lagrangian Relaxation (LR) approach, while the second utilizes the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) concept. For both methods, a time-dependent dynamic programming approach is used to solve the resulting subproblems. A comparison of the two approaches on instances provided by the Chinese high-speed railway indicates that the ADMM-based approach provides tighter upper bounds and typically requires fewer iterations than the Lagrangian Relaxation approach. Furthermore, the results show that a flexible track utilization policy provides better timetables, with fewer cancellations and less total delay, than a fixed, dedicated direction, track policy.}

This paper presents a brand-new data-driven based approach to accurately design the geofencing for UAs around an airport, focusing on midair collision risk between commercial flights and small UAs which is considered as the most important hazard. In premise, prevalent trajectory extraction from real flight tracks is realized based on an advanced and general model, taking the advantage of describing turning legs which is more popular in terminal area. As a key solution, a Gauss-Laplace-composite distribution is provided for rigorous estimation of flight track distribution in line with the extracted prevalent trajectory. Based on those, airport geofencing is proposed consisting of an inner critical area and an outer buffer area. This approach can be adaptive for different traffic patterns of an airport. The buffer area is an extension range to help the execution of some defense measures. Results of an empirical study for setting up geofencing for small UAs around Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport (ZUCK) show the superiority of the proposed approach, which indicates that it can provide practical application, especially varying from different target level of safety.}

The first algorithm integrates connected vehicles (CV) and loop detector data to estimate the trajectory of unconnected vehicles based on car-following concepts. The second algorithm converts the temporal point vehicle detections to a spatial vehicle distribution on a link. The signal control methodology utilizes either algorithm to estimate traffic state on all network links at a time, optimizes the signal timing parameters over a prediction period constituting several time steps, implements the optimal decisions in the next time step, and continues this process until the end of the study period. We applied the methodology to a real-world case study network simulated in Vissim. The results show that both algorithms are effective under a wide range of CV market penetration rates in all tested demand patterns: at 0\% market penetration rate, the proposed methodology reduced travel time by 2\% to 10\% and average delay by 7\% to 20\% compared to the existing signal timing parameters and traffic demand. At a 40\% penetration rate, the proposed algorithms reduced travel time by 27\% to 33\%and average delay by 50\% to 61\% compared to the existing signal and demand pattern in the case study network. Similar trends were found for all other demand patterns tested in this study.}

A comprehensive analytical framework was proposed in this study and applied to data obtained from an SP survey in the U.S. Four modeling steps were involved, to measure the attitudes, identify generational gaps, recognize potential contributors to the attitudes, and decompose the contributions into Endowment, Coefficient, and Interaction effects. The Endowment effects measure how much of the generational differences can be attributed to socioeconomic and demographic variables, while the Coefficient effects reflect the gap that is due to actual behavioral changes or attitudinal shifts between the generations. The findings of this study confirmed the existence of generational gaps in mobility attitudes and revealed that a dominant portion of the gaps stemmed from the different perspectives between the generational cohorts. This indicates that these attitudinal disparities are likely to persist and remain at significant magnitudes, reflecting the unique views and values of the Millennials. Particularly, the preferences for transit and alternative modes and less reliance on private vehicles among Millennials were more of a reflection of their preferences in lifestyle choices and not so much constrained by their socioeconomic status as the previous generation. This study provides empirical evidence of the generational gaps between Millennials and the previous generation in terms of their mobility preferences. The findings provide valuable inputs for policy development in promoting sustainable transportation and community design.}

Network-wide traffic volume information is of great benefit for traffic planning, government management and vehicle emissions control. However, it is difficult to install detectors on every intersection due to the expensive deployment and maintenance costs, and the insufficient sensor coverage across the network limits the direct availability of network-wide traffic flow information. Whereas, crowdsourcing floating car data with a high coverage rate are currently available, which creates an opportunity to address this problem. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to estimate network-wide traffic flow, which incorporates flow records and crowdsourcing floating car data into a geometric matrix completion model. Furthermore, a spatial smoothing index based on the divergence is developed to measure the difficulty of volume estimation for each road segment. We conduct extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms other benchmark models and that the proposed index is highly correlated to estimation accuracy.}

abstract = {On-demand systems in which several users can ride simultaneously the same vehicle have great potential to improve mobility while reducing congestion. Nevertheless, they have a significant drawback: the actual realization of a trip depends on the other users with whom it is shared, as they might impose extra detours that increase the waiting time and the total delay; even the chance of being rejected by the system depends on which travelers are using the system at the same time. In this paper we propose a general description of the sources of unreliability that emerge in ridesharing systems and we introduce several measures. The proposed measures are related to two sources of unreliability induced by how requests and vehicles are being assigned, namely how users’ times change within a single trip and between different realizations of the same trip. We then analyze both sources using a state-of-the-art routing and assignment method, and a New York City test case. Regarding same trip unreliability, in our experiments for different fixed fleet compositions and when reassignment is not restricted, we find that more than one third of the requests that are not immediately rejected face some change, and the magnitude of these changes is relevant: when a user faces an increase in her waiting time, this extra time is comparable to the average waiting time of the whole system, and the same happens with total delay. Algorithmic changes to reduce this uncertainty induce a trade-off with respect to the overall quality of service. For instance, not allowing for reassignments may increase the number of rejected requests. Concerning the unreliability between different trips, we find that the same origin-destination request can be rejected or served depending on the state of the fleet. And when it is served the waiting times and total delay are rarely equal, which remains true for different fleet sizes. Furthermore, the largest variations are faced by trips beginning at high-demand areas.}

Pedestrians are deemed to be the most vulnerable road users and are the major sufferers of road-incident fatalities and injuries each year. Therefore, quite a few studies have focused on pedestrian’s support and safety. On the other hand, due to imperceptible behavior, a pedestrian may also negatively impact traffic efficiency and can thus be viewed as an obstacle for fully realizing the advantages of ITS. In addition, more issues related to pedestrians have been raised with the emergence of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). In this paper, we discuss different issues related to pedestrians as road users. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive survey and classification of the different solutions of pedestrian protection. Finally, we highlight technical gaps and point out possible future research directions.}

In this work, we present a new computationally efficient method, inspired by human vision, to reduce the dimensions of a large-scale network and describe the traffic conditions with a compact, scalable and interpretable custom feature vector. This is done by extracting pockets of congestion that encompass connected 3D subnetworks as 3D shapes. We then parameterize these 3D shapes as 2D projections and construct parsimonious feature vectors from these projections. There are various applications of these feature vectors such as revealing the day-to-day regularity of the congestion patterns and building a classification model that allows us to predict travel time from any origin to any destination in the network. We demonstrate that our method achieves a 44\% accuracy improvement when compared against the consensus method for travel prediction of an urban network of Amsterdam. Our method also outperforms historical average methods, especially for days with severe congestion. Furthermore, we demonstrate the scalability of the approach by applying the method on the entire Dutch highway network and show that the feature vector was able to encapsulate the network dynamics with a 93\% prediction accuracy. There are many paths to further refine and improve the method. The compact form of the feature vector allows us to efficiently enrich it with more information such as context, weather and event without increasing the computational complexity.}

Therefore, validation of CACC running in real traffic is in urgent need. To support the validation, simulation plays a key role. This paper proposes a next-generation simulation platform for CACC evaluation and validation. It is able to not only validate the performance of a CACC platoon by itself, but also evaluate its performance when being released into the traffic. In addition, it can also quantify the impact of CACC vehicles on transportation systems. The proposed platform is generic in terms of CACC control system, background traffic condition, road geometry, and traffic control scheme. Furthermore, it is capable of capturing the dynamics of platoon formation and disengagement when CACC equipped vehicles are mixed up with human-driven vehicles. The proposed platform is validated by comparing against actual field data and previously published theoretical studies. The results confirm the credibility of the proposed platform in terms of: i) CACC control system embedded; ii) CAV and Human-driven Vehicle (HV) mixed traffic simulation; iii) managed lane simulation. It is also revealed that current CACC technology without upgrade may be a safety hazard and permitting CACC only on a dedicated CACC lane might be a good first step for CACC commercialization at this moment.}

Based on systemic thinking and taking a sustainability perspective, we investigate the long-term resilience of the road transportation systems in four cities in China from 1998 to 2017, namely Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing, respectively. The model takes into account various factors collected from multi-source data platforms involved in stages of design, construction, operation, management, and innovation in road transportation systems. We test the model with the forward inference, sensitivity analysis, and backward inference. The result shows that the overall resilience scores of all four cities’ transportation systems are within a moderate range with values between 49\% to 59\%. Although they all have an ever-increasing economic level, the levels of transportation resilience in Beijing and Tianjin decrease first and then gradually increase in a long run, which indicates a strong multi-dimensional, dynamic, and non-linear characteristic in resilience-economic coupling effect. Additionally, the results obtained from the sensitivity analysis and backward inference suggest that decision makers should pay more attention to the capabilities of quickly rebuilding and making changes to cope with future disturbances. As an exploratory study, this study clarifies the concepts of long-term multi-dimensional resilience and specific hazard-related resilience and provides an effective decision-support tool for stakeholders when building resilient infrastructure.}

Up to now, single variable optimization methods resort to rule-based control logics to equalize the inter-departure headways or adhere to the target headway values. One of them is the two-headway-based control logic which determines the holding time of a bus based on its headway with its preceding and following bus without addressing other implications, such as overcrowding. To rectify this, we introduce a new model for the single variable bus holding problem that considers the passenger demand and vehicle capacity limits. Then, we reformulate this problem to an easier-to-solve program with the use of slack variables and introduce an analytic solution that can determine the holding time of a vehicle at the respective bus stop. Our analytic solution does not add a computational burden to the two-headway-based control logic and can be applied in real time. The operational benefit of our bus holding approach compared to other analytic solutions that do not consider the vehicle capacity is investigated using actual data from bus line 302 in Singapore.}

abstract = {Among several crucial objectives of the air transportation system, minimization of fuel consumption has a profound impact on the economic viability of airline companies and their effect on the environment. Given that many large airports around the world are located in the heart of residential areas such as Chicago’s O’Hare, New York’s JFK, and Montreal’s Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GGE) released by aircraft flying through such urban airports directly impacts the health of nearby residents. In this paper, we propose a hybrid taxiing solution to reduce the airports’ impact on GGE where part of the taxiing operations is handled by tow-trucks powered by renewable energy while some other aircraft continue using their engines to complete taxiing. The main contribution of the work presented in this paper is the inclusion of collision of conflict avoidance in the formulation of taxiing operations planning with an objective to minimize fuel consumption and to maximize the desired service quality. The conflict-free taxing operations planning model is tested on Montreal’s Pierre Elliott Trudeau airport. Furthermore, the detailed economic analysis on the adoption of electric-powered tow-trucks is provided.}

The inference of departure/arrival time, mode, and purpose of a trip, for example, rely on the stop/motion patterns represented by smartphone sensor-data. As users handle smartphones for various purposes and their preferences determine different device positions while traveling, accelerometer and gyroscope, for instance, often present ambiguities that prevent accurate stop detection. To mitigate the impact of these ambiguities, we combine spatial time-series, i.e. GPS, with spatial context information retrieved from Open Street Map, which we represent as multi-dimension tensors. This project explores simple representations, such as dummy variables, and novel multidimensional representations, which are bench-marked through the classification performance of specialized artificial neural network (ANN), as well as other machine learning (ML) baselines. Our main contribution stems from this novel multidimensional representation of time-series fusion with spatial context, combined with the corresponding specialized ANN classifier. The results show a stop detection score improvement on the baselines between 3\% and 6.5\%.}

This paper proposes two parallel computation algorithms to solve a large-scale optimal control problem in the coordination of multiple connected vehicles. The coordination is formulated as a centralized optimization problem in the receding horizon fashion. A decentralized computation network is designed to facilitate the development of parallel algorithms. We use Taylor series to linearize non-convex constraints, and introduce a set of consensus constraints to transform the centralized problem to a standard consensus optimization problem. A synchronous parallel algorithm is firstly proposed to solve the consensus optimization problem by applying the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The ADMM framework allows us to decompose the coupling constraints and decision variables, leading to parallel iterations for each vehicle in a synchronous fashion. We then propose an asynchronous version of the parallel algorithm that allows the vehicles to update their variables asynchronously in the computation network. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms are validated by extensive numerical simulations.}

This personalization capacity builds on accurate modeling of user behaviors; however, in practice, a user’s behavior data is often limited, and his preferences in the discrete choice-making process may change or evolve. In this paper, we propose a new online-updating model that can accurately and efficiently estimate an individual’s preferences from his discrete choices. Our model is built on the concept of canonical structure, where a set of canonical models are identified as the common preference patterns shared by the whole population, and a membership vector is also identified for each individual to capture the degrees of the resemblance of his preferences to those common preference patterns. To allow preference to vary in the choice-making process, a time-varying model can be integrated with the canonical structure. In the current study, we use a simple cubic polynomial model with a single variant and show the detailed formulation of the integrated model. An online-updating strategy is also proposed, such that it is possible to update the parameters partially in practice. The proposed model is suitable for modeling a heterogeneous population with insufficient data from each individual. Both simulation studies and a real-world application are taken in the current study. The results show that comparing with other frequently used models, the model we proposed has the highest accuracy in preference learning and behavior prediction.}

abstract = {It is concerned that system-level benefits of connected automated vehicle control might only prevail in a far-future centralized control environment, whereas the benefits could be much offset in a near-future decentralized control system. To address this concern, this paper proposes a decentralized control model for connected automated vehicle trajectory optimization at an isolated signalized intersection with a single-lane road where each connected automated vehicle aims to minimize its own travel time, fuel consumption and safety risks. To improve the computational tractability, the original complex decentralized control model is reformulated into a discrete model. A benchmark centralized control model is also formulated to compare with the decentralized control model. The DIRECT algorithm is adopted to solve the above models. Numerical results show that the decentralized control model has better computational efficiency (with an average solution time of 10 s) than the centralized control model (with an average solution time of 60 s) without significant loss of the system optimality (with an average of 3.91\%). Finally, analysis on connected automated vehicle market penetration shows that the extra benefit of the centralized control model is not obvious either in under-saturated traffic (less than 1\%) or at a low connected automated vehicle market penetration rate in critically-saturated and over-saturated traffic (less than 3\% when the market penetration rate is lower than 20\%). The results suggest that, as apposed to the earlier concern, the near-future decentralized control scheme that requires less technology maturity and infrastructure investment can achieve benefits similar to the far-future centralized control scheme with much simpler operations in under-saturated traffic, or in critically-saturated traffic and over-saturated traffic with a low connected automated vehicle market penetration rate.}

MOD operators’ information provision, delay, and vehicle allocation strategies influence users’ preferences and RTs, which, in turn, affect which operational and information provision strategies are optimal for MOD operators. Evidence shows that preferences and RTs are sensitive to precedent decisions, information frames, risk, and time pressure. These dynamic interplaying factors are challenging to capture using a traditional discrete choice modeling framework. Hence, this study proposes a generalized diffusion model based on Decision Field Theory (DFT), multi-attribute Prospect Theory (PT), and Random Utility Theory to model these various interplaying factors. This study applies the proposed modeling approach in the context of ordering Shared-use Automated Vehicle Mobility Services (SAMS). Sensitivity analyses explore the impacts of various inputs and model parameters such as initial waiting time estimate, updated waiting time estimate, time pressure, loss aversion, and value-of-time on preferences and RTs. The proposed model can provide value to MOD operators in terms of information provision and pricing strategies. Moreover, the proposed model can assist policymakers and planners interested in the system impacts of MOD services and regulating MOD information provision and pricing strategies. The modeling framework can extend to other applications where multiple sub-decisions are necessary to make a single (travel) choice under information update, framing, risk, and time pressure.}

A related mathematical optimization model is formulated with the objective of maximizing the robustness and minimizing the total energy consumption.

This method specifically focuses on one-way line transit corridors with curbside stops and high frequency buses. In such public transit corridors, holding buses at stops may not be suitable for implementation. Instead of holding, we choose to control bus cruising speeds between stops. The relationship between holding and speed-control is discussed. A conventional holding model M0 as well as a model M1, that determines travel times between stops, are considered. In order to make control decisions easy to understand as well as to follow, an improved speed-control model M2 is also proposed. All the models allow for control decisions based on the real-time state of the entire system. The three models are programmed in a rolling horizon scheme within a simulation system. Simulation experiments are conducted to examine these models in different scenarios associated with different levels of traffic randomness. The corresponding results show that, when the traffic is highly variable, the speed-control method can reduce average passenger waiting time by more than 23\% while the holding method results in an average passenger waiting time that is almost 2 min longer than when using the speed-control method. So the speed-control model is shown to be more suitable for implementation in practice. Four strategies that can generate more driver-friendly control decisions are further proposed and tested. The practical applications of the proposed speed-control models are discussed.}

Simultaneous regression models with latent constructs were employed to estimate the expected time and cost savings. The presence of latent constructs accounts for the endogeneity in personal attitudes while the simultaneity allows the analyst to evaluate the potential correlation between the two decisions. Various socioeconomic and demographic variables and personal attitudes were explored in the model to investigate their potential influence on the willingness to adopt ride-sourcing. Analysis based on the survey data indicated an average desired time saving of 20 min per trip, and an average desired cost saving of \$116 per month to switch to on-demand services. Accordingly, individuals younger than 25 years old, between 55 and 59, those with lower education levels, Asians, low income individuals, people with previous ride-sourcing experience, and those who did not favor private car ownership showed lower expectations in view of both travel time and travel cost savings and therefore, were more willing to adopt on-demand services. On the contrary, people aged 30–39 years old (older Millennials), highly auto-dependent individuals, self-employed, people who hardly trust strangers, and those who value private ownership advantages such as privacy and convenience would demand higher savings to convince them to adopt ride-sourcing. This study provides an approach to evaluating the propensity of ride-sourcing usage in view of the desired travel time and cost savings. A better understanding on the magnitude of time and cost savings needed to motivate the public to switch to ride-sourcing options would provide policy makers with valuable information in designing effective and efficient policies and strategies in promoting shared mobility options.}

Storm avoidance constraints are enforced by approximating each cell of the storm as a moving and size-changing ellipsoid. Besides storm avoidance constraints, operational constraints, such as, following an arrival procedure or time-based separation between aircraft, are also considered. The problem is solved using nonlinear model predictive control based on hybrid optimal control with logical constraints in disjunctive form. Logical constraints in disjunctive form arise in modelling of both storm avoidance and operational constraints and also in modelling general decision making processes during flight, such as, establishing which among two or more actions should be taken to solve a contingency. The evolution of the storms is tackled using the nonlinear model predictive control scheme, which iteratively re-plans the trajectories as a new estimation of the state of the storms is available. The presence of this feedback mechanism in the trajectory planning scheme makes it substantially different from open-loop trajectory planning methods. Since it is intended for trajectory planning with very short time horizon before the departure or during the flight, it has been herein called online trajectory planning. An embedding approach is employed to transform logical constraints in disjunctive form into inequality and equality constraints which involve only continuous auxiliary variables. In this way, the hybrid optimal control problem is converted into a smooth optimal control problem, thereby reducing the computational complexity of finding the solution. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through several numerical experiments.}

Deploying UAVs from the truck enables customers located further from the depot to receive drone-based deliveries. The problem is first formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP). However, owing to the computational complexity of this problem, only trivially-sized problems may be solved directly via the MILP. Thus, a heuristic solution approach that consists of solving a sequence of three subproblems is proposed. Extensive numerical testing demonstrates that this approach effectively solves problems of practical size within reasonable runtimes. Additional analysis quantifies the potential time savings associated with employing multiple UAVs. The analysis also reveals that additional UAVs may have diminishing marginal returns. An analysis of five different endurance models demonstrates the effects of these models on UAV assignments. The model and heuristic also support anticipated future systems that feature automation for UAV launch and retrieval.}

Although their apparent use has mostly been limited to image recognition and classification in recent years, generative machine learning algorithms can be a powerful tool for travel behaviour research by replicating travel behaviour by the underlying properties of data structures. In this paper, we examine the use of generative machine learning approach for analyzing multiple discrete-continuous (MDC) travel behaviour data. We provide a plausible perspective of how we can exploit the use of machine learning techniques to interpret the underlying heterogeneities in the data. We show that generative models are conceptually similar to the choice selection behaviour process through information entropy and variational Bayesian inference. Without loss of generality, we consider a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) based algorithm with multiple discrete-continuous layers, formulated as a variational Bayesian inference optimization problem. We systematically describe the proposed machine learning algorithm and develop a process of analyzing travel behaviour data from a generative learning perspective. We show parameter stability from model analysis and simulation tests on an open dataset with multiple discrete-continuous dimensions from a data size of 293,330 observations. For interpretability, we derive the conditional probabilities, elasticities and perform statistical analysis on the latent variables. We show that our model can generate statistically similar data distributions for travel forecasting and prediction and performs better than purely discriminative methods in validation. Our results indicate that latent constructs in generative models can accurately represent the joint distribution consistently on MDC data.}

abstract = {This paper develops a model-based hierarchical control method for coordinated ramp metering on freeway networks with multiple bottlenecks and on- and off-ramps. The controller consists of two levels where at the upper level, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach is developed to optimize total network travel time by manipulating total inflow from on-ramps to the freeway network. The lower level controller distributes the optimal total inflows to each on-ramp of the freeway based on local traffic state feedback. The control method is based on a parsimonious aggregated traffic model that relates the freeway total outflow to the number of vehicles on the freeway sections. Studies on aggregated traffic modeling of networks have shown the existence of a well-defined and low-scatter Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) for urban networks. The MFD links network aggregated flow and density (accumulation). However, the MFD of freeway networks typically exhibits high scatter and hysteresis loops that challenge the control performance of MFD-based controllers for freeways. This paper addresses these challenges by modelling the effect of density heterogeneity along the freeway and capacity drop on characteristics of freeway MFD using field traffic data. In addition, we introduce a model to predict the evolution of density heterogeneity that is essential to reproduce the dynamics of freeway MFD accurately. The proposed model is integrated as the prediction model of the MPC in the hierarchical control method. The proposed coordinated ramp metering method shows desirable performance to reduce the vehicles total time spent and eliminate congestion. The control approach is compared with other coordinated ramp metering controllers based on the MPC framework with different traffic prediction models (e.g.CTM and METANET). The outcomes of numerical experiments highlight that the MFD-based hierarchical controller (i) is better able to overcome the modeling mismatch between the prediction model and the plant (process model) in the MPC framework and (ii) requires less computation effort than other nonlinear controllers.}

We examined the effects of an intelligent speed advisory (ISA) app on driving performance in a simulator. One hundred and four participants (mean age = 35.52 years; 52 male) were allocated to complete the drive with the ISA app in one of five modes: active audio visual (n = 22), active visual (n = 22), passive audio visual (n = 21), passive visual (n = 21) or control (n = 18). Another 19 participants (mean age = 27.53 years; 8 male) completed the study wearing eye-tracking glasses. Participants drove a simulated 26.4 km section of rural road which incorporated typical hazards and three speed compliance zones (100 km/h, 80 km/h and 60 km/h speed limits). The app led to good compliance with the posted speed limits, particularly during the 60 km/h road segment, where the control group drove at significantly higher speeds than the groups with the ISA app. No significant differences between the four versions of the ISA app were observed, either for speed compliance or the number of speeding alerts received. Across the entire simulated drive there were relatively few glances at the app with an average glance duration of 190 ms. The ISA app did not lead to any negative effects on driving performance; lane keeping was maintained and it did not impede participants’ ability to overtake vehicles. These findings suggest that when properly configured ISA apps have a demonstrable safety benefit and do not produce adverse distractive effects. The greatest challenge may be encouraging drivers’ to use them appropriately and consistently.}

abstract = {The approach taken by the second place winner of the TRANSFOR prediction challenge is presented. The challenge involves forecasting travel speeds on two arterial links in Xi’an City in China for two five hour periods on a single day. Travel speeds are measured from trajectory information on probe vehicles from a fleet of vehicles for a large sub-area of the city. After experimenting with several deep learning methods, we settle on a simple non-parametric kernel regression approach. The method, borrowed from previous work in fixed route transit predictions, formalizes the intuition that in urban systems most failure patterns are recurrent. Our choice is supported by test results where the method outperformed all evaluated neural architectures. The results suggest simple methods are very competitive, particularly considering the high lifecycle cost of deep learning models.}

abstract = {The traffic control of an arbitrary network of signalized intersections is considered. This work presents a new version of the recently proposed max-pressure controller, also known as back-pressure. The most remarkable features of the max-pressure algorithm for traffic signal control are: scalability, stability, and distribution. The modified version presented in this paper improves the practical applicability of the max-pressure controller by considering as input travel times instead of queue lengths. The two main practical advantages of this new version are: (i) travel times are easier to estimate than queue lengths, and (ii) max-pressure controller based on travel times has an inherent capacity-aware property, i.e., it takes into account the finite capacity of each link. Travel time tends to diverge when the queue length is close to its capacity. It should be noted that previous max-pressure algorithms rely exclusively on queue length measurements, which may be difficult to accomplish in practice. Moreover, these previous algorithms generally assume queues with unbounded capacity. This may be problematic because a model with unbounded capacity links is not able to reproduce spillbacks, which are one of the most critical phenomena that a traffic signal controller should avoid. After presenting the new version of the max-pressure controller, it is analyzed and compared with existing control policies in a microscopic traffic simulator. Moreover, results of a real implementation of the developed algorithm to a signalized intersection, located at an urban arterial in Jerusalem, are shown and analyzed. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this experiment is the first real implementation of a max-pressure controller at a signalized intersection.}

The industry practice is to adjust the dispatching time of a bus once it departs from the first stop while considering that future trips will operate as planned. In contrast, a rolling-horizon approach adjusts simultaneously the dispatching times of all trips that operate during a pre-determined time interval resulting in a coordinated effort to maintain the target headways. Due to the increased number of dispatching time decisions, this coordinated effort increases the computational burden. To reduce the computational cost, we introduce a nonlinear program and we propose a novel reformulation that limits the recursive relations of the optimization problem. Our program is proved to be convex and can be solved to global optimality under a limited computational cost. In addition, it outperforms myopic methods that adjust the dispatching time of each bus trip in isolation. The sensitivity of our method to travel time and passenger demand fluctuations is investigated on a simulation scenario of bus line 15L in Denver.}

In order to control the ship emission pollution, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has established the Emission Control Areas (ECAs). In the fierce competition of the shipping market, liner shipping companies are looking for strategies to maintain their core competencies under the emission control policy. To achieve this goal, this paper first proposes a bi-objective mixed integer linear programming model, aiming to optimize sailing routes and speeds within and outside the ECA while minimizing the total fuel cost and SO2 emissions. Then, a new algorithm is developed to solve the proposed model by combining the two-stage iterative algorithm and fuzzy logic method based on ∊-constraint. Finally, this paper compares and analyzes the navigation plan of a real sailing route considering and not considering the effects of ECA. Some experiments are conducted to analyze the effects of fuel cost, decision makers, and ECA boundaries on the total fuel cost and SO2 emissions. The results indicate that the proposed model and algorithm can contribute to save fuel cost and reduce SO2 emissions under the ECA policy and provide different Pareto optimal solutions. Thus, the effectiveness of the model and the efficiency of the algorithm are validated.}

This variation is especially important from a driver’s perspective: if a platform’s drivers experience systematic disparities in earnings because of variation in their riders’ destinations, they may perceive the pricing model as inequitable. This perception can exacerbate search frictions if it leads drivers to avoid locations where they believe they may be assigned “unlucky” fares. To characterize any such systematic disparities in productivity, we develop an analytic framework with three key components. First, we propose a productivity metric that looks two consecutive trips ahead, thus capturing the effect on expected earnings of market conditions at drivers’ drop-off locations. Second, we develop a natural experiment by analyzing trips with a common origin but varying destinations, thus isolating purely spatial effects on productivity. Third, we apply a spatial denoising method that allows us to work with raw spatial information exhibiting high levels of noise and sparsity, without having to aggregate data into large, low-resolution spatial zones. By applying our framework to data on more than 1.4 million rides in Austin, Texas, we find significant spatial variation in ride-sourcing driver productivity and search frictions. Drivers at the same location experienced disparities in productivity after being dispatched on trips with different destinations, with origin-based surge pricing increasing these earnings disparities. Our results show that trip distance is the dominant factor in driver productivity: short trips yielded lower productivity, even when ending in areas with high demand. These findings suggest that new pricing strategies are required to minimize random disparities in driver earnings.}

In the aftermath of a disruption, establishing alternative transport means to carry the affected metro passengers, such as via substitute bus (SB) service, is critical. After a particular routing and scheduling plan of SB service is determined, the question is how to assemble the SB fleet, which has different options. Few studies have addressed the issue of designing the contract with a bus company for the provision of SB, including SB availability and service start time guarantee and pricing schemes under uncertain metro system recovery time. This paper attempts to fill this gap. We investigated both the bus company’s profit in providing the SB service and the metro company’s gain in passenger loss reduction after a metro disruption for setting up the SB service contract. Two payment schemes were considered: fixed payment and linear payment. The objective is to design the SB service contract, which defines the payment scheme and guaranteed SB service start time, from both the perspective of the metro company and that of the bus company to explore feasible solutions. In addition, the scenarios of collaborative decision between the bus and metro companies, nonlinear passenger demand drop, fleet size, arrivals of new passengers, and passengers waiting time are investigated.}

abstract = {This paper extends a real-time, Connected Vehicle-based traffic signal control algorithm at isolated intersections to balance between two competing intersection objectives: efficiency and equity. In this approach, a central controller is used to collect real-time locations of connected vehicles at regular intervals, which can then be used to also identify the existence of some of the non-connected vehicles. The control algorithm then aims to optimize the discharge sequence of naturally occurring platoons of vehicles based on their proximity. Specifically, the strategy selects the platoon discharge sequence—and associated signal phase and timing plan—that minimizes average vehicle delay (measure of efficiency) while limiting the maximum delay any individual vehicle may experience (measure of equity). The latter objective is only possible with detailed vehicle-level information available from connected vehicles. The results show that without the threshold on maximum individual vehicle delay, average delay is often minimized at the expense of very large delays imposed onto some vehicles. By implementing a threshold, both the maximum vehicle delay and the distribution of individual vehicle delays—as measured by the standard deviation and a common measure of population inequity, the Gini coefficient—can be improved, often with only negligible impacts to intersection efficiency. However, the tradeoff between equity and efficiency becomes more significant as the maximum vehicle delay threshold decreases. Sensitivity tests show that this control algorithm works well for different total traffic demands and different demand patterns. The proposed algorithm is also effective under imperfect connected vehicle penetration rates when the connected vehicles make up more than 40\% of the traffic stream. The results suggest that the proposed strategy can help significantly reduce long delays and inequitable treatment of vehicles at an intersection when vehicle-level information is available to a signal controller.}

Interactions between AVs and their drivers, and interaction with other human drivers involve new types of complex behavioural processes. There is an increasing necessity to explicitly incorporate these human factor processes in simulation, which cannot be properly accounted for with most current models. In this paper, we present an extended conceptual simulation framework based on human factors processes and applicable for automated driving that does this. The framework makes use of previously constructed constructs to include the effects of driver task demand, situation awareness and fundamental diagrams of task demand to extend to automated driving. This is especially considered for the case of transition of control (ToC), as an important aspect of vehicle-driver interaction. The framework is demonstrated in two experimental cases that consider different ToC situations and is found to be face valid within the applied assumptions. Challenges remain in regard to a lack of quantitative evidence from traffic psychology, automated vehicle dynamics & control and human-vehicle interaction. With increasing amounts of research on-going in these areas, the extended framework will act as a valuable approach to further study and quantify the effects of AVs in mixed traffic in the future.}

The study employs a multivariate approach to model five behavioral dimensions simultaneously: (1) technology-savviness (TS) propensity, (2) interest in productive use of travel time (IPTT) propensity, (3) interest in work relocation, (4) interest in residential relocation, and (5) tolerance to an increase in commute travel time. Data from a web-based survey of commuters in 2017 in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metropolitan Area (DFW) is employed. The results show that both TS and IPTT, as well as demographic variables, impact relocation decisions when individuals have a private AV available for their commute. Importantly, there is considerable heterogeneity across individuals in the willingness to relocate and/or accept longer commute times in an AV future. As such, our model results may be used to inform inputs to land use and travel demand models in an AV future. Also, our results suggest that the magnitude of value of travel time savings (VTTS) decrease considered in many earlier AV impact simulation studies may be much higher than reality. Relative to 50\% and even 100\% VTTS decreases assumed in many studies, our results suggest a much more modest 30\% or so overall decrease in VTTS because of the ability to commute in a privately-owned AV. Finally, our results do predict a rather substantial extent of urban sprawl due to AVs, potentially up to a 68\% increase in the horizontal spread of cities such as Dallas-Fort Worth, unless proactive planning and policies are implemented to avert such consequences of AVs.}

Numerical examples based on real-world networks reveal that the SO of most of the tested networks can be achieved with an MCR below 23\%. Considering the low market penetration of AVs at early stages of their deployment, we further investigate a joint path-based control and pricing scheme to replicate SO. Numerical examples demonstrate the remarkable synergy of these combined instruments on reducing the MCR with little collected tolling revenue.}

Experiments have considered regulated traffic scenarios where ETOT were allocated in order to reduce departure time uncertainties. Lastly, it is analysed the impact of the parameters used by the methodology to calculate the mitigation measures: safe separation criteria, look-ahead time and number of coordinated airports.}

Logarithmic multivariate Gaussian models are trained to evaluate the performance of aircrafts at different flight phases (takeoff, ascent, cruise, etc.) separately. By including a forward synchronization, feature selection, and mini-batch training process, this model overcomes challenges introduced by the large size and high dimensionality of flight datasets. This framework also addresses the re-sampling issue in existing literature causing difficulties in handling time-series signals with different lengths. For demonstration and validation, the developed model is applied to analyze performance anomalies associated with the mechanical system and pilot operation in a historical flight dataset. Compared with existing literature focusing on similar datasets, this evaluation methodology shows promise in detecting performance anomalies especially at approach and takeoff phases. Therefore, the developed model is expected to be an effective addition to the current anomaly analysis and monitoring technologies for scheduled commercial flights. Applications include assisting transportation management systems by handling large amounts of historical flight datasets to analyze mechanical and operational anomalies, which may potentially improve future aeronautical system design and pilot training.}

The transportation network companies (TNCs) have been collecting high-granular ride-sourcing vehicle (RV) trajectory data over the past decade, while it is still unclear how the RV data can improve current dynamic network modeling for network traffic management. This paper proposes to statistically estimate network disequilibrium level (NDL), namely to what extent the dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) conditions are deviated in real-world networks. Using the data based on RV trajectories, we present a novel method to estimate the real-world NDL measure. More importantly, we present a method to compute zone-to-zone travel time data from trajectory-level RV data. This would become a data sharing scheme for TNCs such that, while being used to effectively estimate and reduce NDL, the zone-to-zone data reveals neither personally identifiable information nor trip-level business information if shared with the public. In addition, we present an NDL based traffic management method to perform user optimal routing on a small fraction of vehicles in the network. The NDL measures and NDL-based routing are examined on two real-world large-scale networks: the City of Chengdu with trajectory-level RV data and the City of Pittsburgh with zone-to-zone travel time data. We found that, on weekdays in each city, NDLs are likely high when travel demand is high (thus when congestion is mild or heavy). Generally, a weekend midnight exhibits higher NDLs than a weekday midnight. Many NDL patterns are different between Chengdu and Pittsburgh, which are attributed to unique characteristics of both demand and supply in each city. For instance, NDL in Pittsburgh is much more stable from day to day and from hour to hour, comparing to Chengdu. In addition, we observe that origin-destination pairs with high NDLs are spatially and temporally sparse for both cities. For the Pittsburgh network, we evaluate the effectiveness of NDL-based traffic routing, which shows great potential to reduce total travel time with routing a small fraction of vehicles (1\% in the experiments), even using dated NDL that is estimated in the prior hour.}

During the evaluation of treatment alternatives for a segment in a pavement network, the model considers benefits of both the evaluated treatment and its following actions. It also incorporates the influence of treatment cost and deterioration uncertainties. Treatments are selected for each segment in the pavement network using a risk-based optimization model. Three case studies are presented to illustrate the application and benefits of this new model. Results of the first two cases show that the risk-aversion coefficient in the model influences segment-level treatment selections and pavement network performance. The third case shows that the PTPD model performs better than a benefit-cost ratio model due to the incorporation of uncertainties and treatment path dependence. To obtain a similar performance level, the conventional model requires a 10.4\% higher annual budget for the given case study. The results presented here suggest that elements of this model – notably consideration of uncertainty in deterioration and cost, treatment path dependency, and explicit risk trade-offs – could be incorporated into asset management tools to improve the cost-effectiveness of pavement network planning.}

In this research, we design an optimal lane management strategy for corridors with a heterogeneous demand of human-driven, autonomous, and communicant autonomous vehicles (HVs, AVs, and CAVs). In a monocentric city setting, we dynamically control the inflow of the network by optimizing the size of CAV platoons in the corridors based on the instantaneous condition of the integrated system. These corridors can potentially have three types of lanes for vehicles with different levels of automation technology. We model the multiple lane type corridors as sets of parallel bottlenecks with general distributions of multiclass demand. The dynamics of the congestion in the network is also modeled using the macroscopic network fundamental diagram (MNFD). To study the impacts of the rise in the penetration rate of AVs and CAVs on the performance of the system, we derive a closed-form representation of the model. We show that the increase of the delay in the network with the rise in the penetration rate of AVs and CAVs can have a stable, an unstable, or a hybrid pattern. To optimize the system, we minimize a weighted summation of the experienced delay in the corridors and the total travel time in the urban network by optimizing the number of lanes of each type and the dynamic size of the CAV platoons. The results of the San Francisco case study show that implementing an optimal lane management strategy can reduce the experienced delay in the corridors up to 78\% with a rise in the AV/CAV penetration rate. By dynamically controlling the size of the CAV platoons in the automated highway of the Bay Bridge, we limit the increase of the travel time in the downtown network as low as 5\%.}

Human-drive vehicles (HDVs) are modeled by a non-equilibrium traffic flow model, i.e., Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) to capture HDV traffic's unstable nature. CAVs are modeled by a mean field game describing their non-cooperative behaviors as rational utility-optimizing agents. Working with continuum models helps avoiding scalability issues in microscopic multi-class traffic models. We demonstrate from linear stability analysis that the mean field game traffic flow model behaves differently from traditional traffic flow models and stability can only be proved when the total density is in a certain regime. We also show from numerical experiments that CAVs help stabilize mixed traffic. Further, we quantify the impact of CAV's penetration rate and controller design on traffic stability. The results may provide qualitative insights on traffic stability in mixed-autonomy for human drivers and city planners. The results also provide suggestions on CAV controller design for CAV manufacturers.}

These operations are typically managed by third-party contractors, which leverage a team of escorts and a set of wheelchairs to provide mobility assistance services. The performance of these systems relies critically on the dispatch of escorts and wheelchairs to serve each traveler request. Sub-optimal dispatch can lead to negative individual and system-wide implications, such as long passenger wait times, customer dissatisfaction or added delays in flight departures. This paper reports the outcomes of a collaboration with the Pittsburgh International Airport that involved three steps. First, the collection and digitization of data provided visibility into demand for mobility assistance services and historical performance of the system. Second, we propose an original integer programming model to optimize and support the assignment of escorts to traveler requests, and we develop an efficient solution approach based on a rolling algorithm to enable the implementation of the model with realistic problem sizes. We verify that the model’s outputs are consistent with insights obtained from the historical records of operations, and identify opportunities to enhance the level of service without increasing system capacity. In particular, the results suggest that improvements in information flows and in communication between airlines, the central dispatcher and passenger escorts can result in significant dispatch improvements. Third, we leveraged these insights by developing a tablet application to provide real-time visibility into traveler requests, dispatch recommendations, and data visualizations for continued performance assessment and enhancement.}

Field tests of the procedure have shown significant fuel savings, implying that the procedure can play an important role in the Next Generation Air Transportation System being implemented in the U.S. In this paper we study optimal departure operations at airports in the context of departure metering. More specifically, we develop a stochastic dynamic programming framework for tactical management of pushback operations at gates and for determining the optimal number of aircraft to be directed to the runway queue from the metering areas. We introduce four easy-to-implement departure metering policies, and perform comparative analyses between these practical policies and the numerical-optimization based policies. In addition, from a strategic perspective, we identify optimal capacities for metering areas to be used as part of departure metering implementations. Overall, we find that the annual fuel and operating savings for airlines could be around \$1.7 million if our proposed policies are implemented at the Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport. Such policies can also be adapted by other airports to improve the overall efficiency of surface traffic management and departure operations.}

The model addresses the issue around measurement uncertainty underlying infrastructure condition assessments for continuous distress indicators and its effect on the parametric models underlying decision-support tools. Through a case study of pavement roughness data collected as part of FHWA’s long-term pavement performance program, the new approach reduces the unexplained variance that would typically enter decision-support tools by 14\%. It also addresses concerns around heteroscedasticity surrounding conventional methods, allowing modelers to recover efficiency in their statistical estimates. The proposed methodology is of particular significance for decision-makers and stakeholders evaluating infrastructure distress data subject to considerable uncertainty. The contributions of this research will allow transportation agencies to integrate improved performance models within their asset management frameworks.}

abstract = {Connected automated vehicles (CAVs) have been currently considered as promising solutions for realization of envisioned autonomous traffic management systems in the future. CAVs can achieve high desired traffic efficiency and provide safe, energy-saving, and comfortable ride experience for passengers. However, in order to practically implement such autonomous systems based on CAVs, there exist several significant challenges to be dealt with, such as coupled spatiotemporal constraints on CAVs’ trajectories at unsignalized intersections, multiple objectives for trajectory optimization in road segments, and heterogeneous decision-making behaviors of CAVs in road networks with highly dynamic traffic demand. In this paper, we propose a cooperative autonomous traffic organization method for CAVs in multi-intersection road networks. The methodological framework consists of threefold components: an autonomous crossing strategy based on a conflict resolution approach at unsignalized intersections, multi-objective trajectory optimization in road segments, and a composite strategy for route planning considering heterogeneous decision-making behaviors of CAVs based on social and individual benefit, respectively. Specifically, we first identify a set of potential conflict points of different CAVs’ spatial trajectories at the intersection, and then design different minimum safe time headways to resolve conflicts. Under the constraints of entry and exit conditions at adjacent intersections, we propose a multi-objective optimal control model by jointly considering vehicle safety, energy conservation, and ride comfort, and then analytically derive a closed-form solution for optimizing the CAVs’ trajectories. Furthermore, with the purpose to adapt dynamic traffic demand, we propose a composite strategy for route planning by coordinating heterogeneous decision-making behaviors of CAVs in road networks. Finally, extensive simulation experiments have been performed to validate our proposed method and to demonstrate its advantage over conventional baseline schemes in terms of global traffic efficiency. Additional numerical results are also provided to shed light on the impact of the proportion of CAVs with heterogeneous decision-making behaviors on the global system performance.}

abstract = {Bridges are critical components of highways ensuring traffic can efficiently travel over obstructions such as bodies of water, valleys, and other roads. Ensuring bridges are in sound structural condition is essential for safe and efficient highway operations. Structural health monitoring (SHM) systems designed to measure bridge responses have been developed to quantitatively track the health of bridges. More recently, SHM systems have also begun to integrate measurement of vehicular loads that create the responses measured. However, precise correlation of traffic loads to bridge responses remains a costly and technically difficult strategy. To address existing technical limitations, a cyber-physical system (CPS) framework is proposed to track truck loads in a highway corridor, to trigger SHM systems to record bridge responses, and to automate the linking of bridge response data with truck weights collected by weigh-in-motion (WIM) stations installed along the corridor but not collocated with the bridges. To link truck weights to bridge responses, computer vision methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) are used to automate the detection and reidentification of trucks using traffic cameras. The single-stage CNN object detector YOLO is trained using a customized dataset to identify trucks from camera images at each instrumentation site; high precision is obtained with the YOLO detector exceeding 95\% average precision (AP) for an intersection over union (IOU) threshold of 0.75. To reidentify the same truck at different locations in the corridor, this study adopts a CNN-based encoder trained via a triplet network and a mutual nearest neighbor strategy using feature vectors extracted from images at each measurement location. The proposed reidentification method is implemented in the CPS cloud environment and obtains a F1-score of 0.97. The study also explores the triggering of bridge monitoring systems based on visual detection of trucks by a traffic camera installed upstream to the bridges. The triggering strategy proves to be highly efficient with 99\% of the triggered data collection cycles capturing truck events at each bridge. To validate, the CPS architecture is implemented on a 20-mile highway corridor that has a WIM station already installed; four traffic cameras and two bridge SHM systems are installed along the corridor and integrated with a CPS architecture hosted on the cloud. In total, over 10,000 trucks are observed at all measurement locations over one year allowing peak bridge responses to be correlated to both measured truck weights and to one another.}

This study accordingly focuses on the autonomous taxi (aTaxi) dispatching problem in hybrid request mode where travelers can either request immediate rides or reserve taxi services ahead of time. In this study, a centralized dispatcher and decentralized autonomous dispatchers are designed to plan short-term and long-term routes for aTaxis in real time, respectively. The centralized dispatcher integrates vehicle-to-passenger assignment with empty vehicle rebalance to guarantee solution quality. Decentralized autonomous dispatchers distribute a portion of the calculation to aTaxis, thus reducing the centralized dispatcher’s workload. The dispatching strategy ensures that the response to traveler requests can be made immediately, and if such requests are accepted, the travelers will receive the expected services. Finally, experiments are conducted based on the actual road network and the trip data of Manhattan to investigate the dispatching strategy. The results confirm the high performance of the proposed dispatching strategies in terms of service quality and economic efficiency. It is also found that the increase in reservation rates can enhance the robustness of the method with respect to errors in predicted requests. Moreover, when the number of vehicles is adequate and reservations are made longer ahead of time, the completion rate of requests and the revenue improve.}

abstract = {The area-based (i.e., non-lane based) heterogeneous traffic (as in developing countries) has significant differences from the lane-based homogeneous traffic (as in developed countries). In area-based traffic, drivers generally ignore the lane markings and perceive the entire road space while progressing longitudinally. The traditional car-following and lane changing models are not directly applicable to model such driving behaviour. This research aims to microscopically model the dynamics of the subject vehicle in area-based traffic flow. The modelling is conducted in two steps: area selection, and vehicle movement. In step-1, a multinomial logit (MNL) model is considered for selecting the area-based movement direction of the subject vehicle. The choice space of the subject vehicle is divided into numbers of realistic radial cones considering the possible moving directions of the subject vehicle in the next simulation time step. These radial cones form the alternatives for the decision of the subject vehicle. The attributes of the alternatives are defined in terms of angular deviation from the direction of the flow, spacing and relative speed. This model is calibrated and validated for both cars and motorcycles using real trajectory data, and the results demonstrate the good performance of the model. In step-2, a modified intelligent driving model (MIDM) is proposed to simulate the next position of the subject vehicle (along the selected direction as the outcome of the model in step-1). The parameters of the MIDM model are calibrated using real data for cars and motorcycles. The deterministic parameters for MNL model and the empirical distribution of the MIDM model parameters are utilized to stochastically simulate vehicle trajectories with the initial and boundary conditions determined by the real dataset. The comparison of the macroscopic properties between the simulated and real datasets provides promising results for the simulation applicability of the proposed modelling framework.}

In the dynamic phase, we propose a hierarchical decision-making model to describe the interactive manner between operator and passengers. The CB network design problem is formulated in a mixed-integer program with the objective of maximizing operator’s revenue. The CB passenger’s travel behavior is measured by a discrete choice model given the trip plan provided by the operator. A dynamic insertion method is developed to address the proposed model in the dynamic phase. For the network design problem in the static phase, the service network is re-optimized based on the confirmed passengers with strict time deviation constraints embedded in the static multi-vehicle pickup and delivery problem. An exact solution method is developed based on the branch-and-bound (B&B) algorithm. Numerical examples are conducted to verify the proposed models and solution algorithms.}

abstract = {This paper develops a flexible, real-time traffic signal control algorithm to optimize both phase durations and phase sequences at four-approach intersections with conflicting left-turns, based on information obtained from connected vehicles. Vehicle-to-infrastructure communications are assumed to provide the location of all connected vehicles near the signalized intersection at regular time intervals and this information is used to identify the presence of non-connected vehicles that are stopped at the intersection. All detected and identified vehicles are used to identify naturally occurring platoons in the traffic stream. The signal control algorithm then selects the optimal sequence that these platoons should discharge through the intersection to minimize average delay of all identified vehicles. Since all possible departure sequences for platoons of vehicles are considered, the problem is computationally difficult. Hence, several heuristic methods are proposed to determine optimal platoon departure sequences. These heuristics include an intelligent tree search and multiple types of genetic algorithms, including a newly developed genetic algorithm that perserves phase order sequence that is vital to this problem. Comparisons between these heuristics and the global optimal solution suggest that the heuristics are able to provide similar operational performance with significant reductions in total computation time required, such that the algorithm can be applied in real-time. In general, the intelligent tree search appears to outperform the genetic algorithm approaches in terms of operational performance but has computational requirements that increase exponentially with the number of platoons identified at the intersection. Meanwhile, the genetic algorithm methods tend to be more scalable but slightly less efficient. Overall, the results are promising for the application of the proposed flexible signal control algorithm at real intersections.}

The experiment results show that the postprocessing the residuals of Neural Network by the ARIMA analysis helps to significantly improve accuracy of traffic state prediction by 8.9–13.4\% in term of mean squared error reduction. In order to verify the efficiency of the ARIMA analysis in the postprocessing, Multidimensional Support Vector Regression (MSVR) model is also employed to replace the role of Neural Network in the comparative experiment. Two streams of comparisons, (1) NN vs. NN-ARIMA and (2) MSVR vs. MSVR-ARIMA, are performed and show consistent results. The proposed approach not only can capture network-wide co-movement pattern of traffic flows, but also seize location-specific traffic characteristics as well as sharp nonlinearity of macroscopic traffic variables.

Such construct requires less road space, which is a scarce resource in dense urban areas, and thus may be the only feasible alternative for the installation of exclusive bus corridors. The system model includes limits on bus passenger capacity. The control method for real-time operation integrates bus headway corrections and bus priority through signalized intersections, while enforcing mutual exclusion of opposing buses on the bidirectional lanes. Effectively, the control avoids bus bunching over the entire corridor and coordinates the passage of opposing buses on bidirectional lanes. The objective is to minimize the total waiting time of passengers, both onboard and at stops. Simulation results indicate the applicability of the integrated holding and priority bidirectional lane control method.}

abstract = {Origin-Destination (OD) matrix is a tableau of travel demand distributed between different zonal pairs. Essentially, OD matrix provides two types of information: (a) the individual cell value represents travel demand between a specific OD pair; and (b) group of OD pairs provides insights into structural information in terms of distribution pattern of OD flows. Comparison of OD matrices should account both types of information. Limited studies in the past developed structural similarity measures, and most studies still depend on traditional measures for OD matrices comparison. Traditional performance measures are based on cell by cell comparison, and often neglect OD matrix structural information within their formulations. We propose a methodology that adopts the fundamentals of Levenshtein distance, traditionally used to compare sequences of strings, and extends it to quantify the structural comparison of OD matrices. The novel performance measure is named as normalised Levenshtein distance for OD matrices (NLOD). The results of sensitivity analysis support NLOD to be a robust statistical measure for holistic comparison of OD matrices. The study demonstrates the practicality of the approach with a case study application on real Bluetooth based OD matrices from the Brisbane City Council (BCC) region, Australia.}

In this paper we propose a model to optimize the location of the wireless charging lanes (WCL) by taking into account their effects on road capacity and traveler’s route choice. The model is formulated as a nonlinear programming problem and solved by a linearization method. A new method is developed to reduce the maximum error in the linearization process. The model and solution method are tested on Nguyen-Dupuis and Sioux Falls networks. The numerical results show that relatively high charging power and reasonable budget are necessary to recover the investment when charging lanes are deployed on road network. It is also demonstrated that the impacts of WCL on road capacity drop and travelers’ route choice are not negligible, and should be considered in the determination of WCL location.}

Autonomous delivery vehicles (ADVs) are believed to have the potential to revolutionise last-mile delivery in a way that is more sustainable and customer focused. However, if not widely accepted, the introduction of ADVs as a delivery option can be a substantial waste of resources. At present, the research on consumers’ receptivity of innovations in last-mile delivery, such as ADVs, is limited. This study is the first that investigates the users’ acceptance of ADVs in Germany by utilising an extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) and adapted it to the context of ADVs in last-mile delivery. Quantitative data was collected through an online survey approach (n = 501) and structural equation modelling was undertaken. The results indicate that price sensitivity is the strongest predictor of behavioural intention (i.e., user acceptance), followed by performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, perceived risk, social influence and facilitating conditions, whereas no effect could be found for effort expectancy. These findings have important theoretical and practical contributions in the areas of technology acceptance and last-mile delivery.}

This paper develops a short-term traffic states forecasting algorithm based on partial least square (PLS) to help enhance real-time decision-making and build better insights into traffic data. The proposed model is capable of predicting short-term traffic states accurately and efficiently by capturing dominant spatiotemporal features and day-to-day variations from collinear and correlated traffic data. Three case studies are developed to demonstrate the proposed model in short-term traffic prediction applications.}

abstract = {Macroscopic pedestrian models are theoretically simpler than microscopic models, and they can potentially be solved faster while producing reasonable predictions of crowd dynamics. Therefore, they can be very useful for applications such as large-scale simulation, real-time state estimation and crowd management. However, the numerical methods presently used to solve macroscopic pedestrian models, which are mostly grid-based, have some shortcomings that limit their applicability. More specifically, they usually include complex procedures for grid generation and remeshing, and they produce simulation results that may not be sufficiently accurate (for example, because of unclear boundaries between flow states). Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) constitutes an alternative numerical method that could potentially overcome these limitations. SPH is a meshfree method where a crowd is represented by a set of particles that possess material properties and move according to macroscopic laws. Relevant state variables at each particle are approximated using information about the material properties of the neighboring particles and a smoothing function. This paper puts forward for the first time a generic SPH framework for solving macroscopic pedestrian models; in addition, it demonstrates that an SPH-based simulation model can produce meaningful and accurate results by means of three case studies. The first case study shows that the proposed numerical method can approximate well the analytical solution of a simple macroscopic model applied to a queue-discharge scenario. The second case study demonstrates that the proposed numerical method can potentially reproduce density dispersion (a phenomenon observed in real crowds) more accurately than grid-based methods, due to its meshfree, Lagrangian, and particle-based nature. The third case study highlights the need to reformulate the acceleration equation of the basic macroscopic model in order to reproduce lane formation in bi-directional flows (also an observed phenomenon) using the proposed SPH framework, and this paper presents a solution to do so.}

abstract = {In the foreseeable future, the traffic stream will be likely mixed with connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and regular vehicles (RVs). In the mixed traffic environment, when following a RV, due to the lack of vehicle-to-vehicle communications, it may take longer time for a CAV to sense and react than a human driver, which results in longer time headway and the loss of highway throughput. To address such a connectivity gap, this paper investigates an infrastructure-based solution, i.e., the deployment of roadside units to help CAVs in the heterogeneous traffic stream. Specifically, it is envisioned that these roadside units can sense vehicles in their coverage areas and provide the beyond-line-of-sight motion information to CAVs to empower them to react proactively, as they would do when following other CAVs. This paper is devoted to the analysis of the impacts of this type of roadside units at a strategic planning stage. In doing so, we first derive an analytical link performance function to capture their impact on the link capacity and travel time, and then develop a network equilibrium model to gauge their effect on travelers’ route choices and thus the flow distribution of both RVs and CAVs across the whole network. This modeling development will allow us to conduct a cost-benefit analysis for a given deployment plan of roadside units. For fair analyses, we further develop an optimization model to determine the optimal deployment plan for a given budget, while focusing on the worst case of its impact, because the flow distribution resulting from our network equilibrium model is not unique. Such a model provides a conservative estimate of the benefit brought by roadside units. Lastly, we offer case studies to demonstrate the models and unveil the potential of such an infrastructure-based solution.}

abstract = {In recent years, several perimeter control strategies have been proposed for traffic management in cities. The common factor found in these works is the use of Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) models to describe the dynamics of the network and optimize traffic inside the perimeter by manipulating perimeter inflows. Perimeter gating control strategies are attractive for traffic management inside the inner city. However, it inevitably creates a negative impact on the traffic outside. Most of the works in this research area have neglected vehicle re-routing outside the controlled perimeter, i.e., they do not consider demand elasticity to the central region resulting from gating and the related queues. In this paper, we propose a global modeling framework capable of assessing the effect of perimeter gating control (in terms of queue, emission, and total time spent) on the full network, considering demand elasticity resulting from Dynamic User Equilibrium (DUE). Classical Proportional-Integral (PI) control scheme is used to control traffic congestion inside a central region (reservoir). The modeling framework is comprised of: (i) an accumulation-based MFD model to reproduce traffic dynamics inside the reservoir, (ii) point-queue model to represent queuing vehicles on inbound links to the gating points, and (iii) a time-dependent travel time profile based on a steady-state approximation of MFD dynamics to characterize the alternative road network (bypass). DUE is then implemented, considering instantaneous predicted travel time. This determines how the demand to the inner region is affected by the gating. The functioning of the global system is assessed by total time spent and NOx and CO2 emissions inside the reservoir and for the full network. The presented simulation results show that the perimeter gating control helps to maintain congestion at the desired level with significant improvements in the total time spent and the mean speed in the network. However, it shows a slight increase in the queues. As expected, deviation to the bypass alternative is significant and should not be neglected when carrying out a global assessment of gating system performance.}

The realization of these opportunities requires going beyond the existing traditional ways of collecting traffic data that are based either on fixed-location sensors or GPS devices with low spatial coverage or penetration rates and significant measurement errors, especially in congested urban areas. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) or simply “drones” have been proposed as a pioneering tool of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) infrastructure due to their unique characteristics, but various challenges have kept these efforts only at a small size. This paper describes the system architecture and preliminary results of a first-of-its-kind experiment, nicknamed pNEUMA, to create the most complete urban dataset to study congestion. A swarm of 10 drones hovering over the central business district of Athens over multiple days to record traffic streams in a congested area of a 1.3 km2 area with more than 100 km-lanes of road network, around 100 busy intersections (signalized or not), many bus stops and close to half a million trajectories. The aim of the experiment is to record traffic streams in a multi-modal congested environment over an urban setting using UAS that can allow the deep investigation of critical traffic phenomena. The pNEUMA experiment develops a prototype system that offers immense opportunities for researchers many of which are beyond the interests and expertise of the authors. This open science initiative creates a unique observatory of traffic congestion, a scale an-order-of-magnitude higher than what was available till now, that researchers from different disciplines around the globe can use to develop and test their own models.}

This paper aims to employ a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to model idle e-hailing drivers’ optimal sequential decisions in passenger-seeking. Transportation network companies (TNC) or e-hailing (e.g., Didi, Uber) drivers exhibit different behaviors from traditional taxi drivers because e-hailing drivers do not need to actually search for passengers. Instead, they reposition themselves so that the matching platform can match a passenger. Accordingly, we incorporate e-hailing drivers’ new features into our MDP model. The reward function used in the MDP model is uncovered by leveraging an inverse reinforcement learning technique. We then use 44,160 Didi drivers’ 3-day trajectories to train the model. To validate the effectiveness of the model, a Monte Carlo simulation is conducted to simulate the performance of drivers under the guidance of the optimal policy, which is then compared with the performance of drivers following one baseline heuristic, namely, the local hotspot strategy. The results show that our model is able to achieve a 17.5\% improvement over the local hotspot strategy in terms of the rate of return. The proposed MDP model captures the supply-demand ratio considering the fact that the number of drivers in this study is sufficiently large and thus the number of unmatched orders is assumed to be negligible. To better incorporate the competition among multiple drivers into the model, we have also devised and calibrated a dynamic adjustment strategy of the order matching probability.}

As FCW directly affects how vehicles interact longitudinally with one another, it may also influence car-following behavior such as reaction time, which has been little researched. To investigate these effects, driving data were collected from the Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study. Five data-collecting vehicles were equipped with Mobileye® systems, which included an FCW function with headway display and warning system. Participants drove the vehicles for two months, with the Mobileye® system activated the second month only. From the 161,055 km of naturalistic driving data collected from 60 drivers, 3,000 car-following events were selected, and the effects of FCW on car-following headway and reaction time, and on the parameter values of the Gazis-Herman-Rothery (GHR) model were examined. Results showed that (1) drivers tended to maintain shorter headway with FCW enabled, while the proportion of time in short headways did not increase; (2) FCW reduced car-following reaction time when the lead vehicle was accelerating and when the relative speed between the lead and following vehicle was large; and (3) a reduction in the space headway exponent of the GHR was observed when FCW was enabled, indicating that drivers follow more closely with FCW because the system increases drivers’ sensitivity to changes in following gaps. Results of this study suggest that an FCW system with a headway monitoring function may increase traffic efficiency and stability without degrading safety.}

This study proposes a method to reconstruct vehicle trajectories in fully sampled traffic flow on freeways that consists of human-driven vehicles (HVs) and CAVs by using the mobile sensing data acquired from CAVs. The expected behavior of vehicles within the detection range of CAVs is determined based on the driving state classified by the Wiedemann model, i.e., free driving, emergency, closing, and following. If the actual behavior is different from the expected, it is deemed to be influenced by the undetected HVs. Then, new HVs are inserted based on the estimated local traffic density and speed of the freeway. The trajectories of the inserted HVs are further reconstructed by using the established update rules of cellular automation, i.e., uniform motion, acceleration, deceleration, randomization and position update. Last, the proposed method was examined by simulation experiments under different traffic densities and PRs of CAVs. The results show that the trajectories of fully sampled mixed traffic flow can be reconstructed reasonably well, not only under traffic conditions without explicit congestion but in congested environments.}

Facility utilization can be improved without affecting travelers’ charging demand under correct pricing scheme for most cost-sensitive users. Smart grid charging strategy can greatly reduce the total number of operating chargers during the same time in a day, and BEV users’ charging behaviors have minor impact on this improvement.

The deployment of charging infrastructures, as well as the number of stand-by buses available, has a significant effect on the operational efficiency of electric bus systems. In this work, a stochastic integer program has been developed to jointly optimise charging station locations and bus fleet size under random bus charging demand, considering time-of-use electricity tariffs. The stochastic program is first approximated by its sample average and is solved by a customised Lagrangian relaxation approach. The applicability of the model and solution algorithm is demonstrated by applications to a series of hypothetical grid networks and to a real-world Melbourne City bus network.

Real-world data obtained from an LCS on I-66 in Northern Virginia was used to calibrate and validate a baseline simulation model. Further, the current lane control scenarios utilized in the Northern Virginia LCS were identified and relevant data resulting from implementation of those scenarios were collected to model the LCS in a simulation environment. The performance of real-world LCS was then compared to a prototype CAV-enabled LCS application developed in this research. The CAV-enabled LCS application consistently outperformed the traditional LCS with increased throughput and speeds. On average, an increase of 18.4\%, 9.6\% and 12.8\% in throughput was observed for three selected scenarios under the best case of a 1 sec headway. Furthermore, the CAV-enabled LCS application was also found to reduce volatility, represented by variation in acceleration and deceleration regimes, by an average of 25.6\% and 49.6\%. The reduction in turbulence in the traffic stream may indicate potential improved safety with the CAV system.}

abstract = {Network state degradation probabilities increase with traffic density. Specifically, at critical or congested densities, any over-input traffic flow may cause degradation, local traffic jams, and even hysteresis of the road network. Existing macroscopic traffic control methods usually target the maximum capacity or minimum delay to improve the road network efficiency and do not consider the negative effect of perimeter control on the state transfer of the road network. This study provides a method to prevent the transfer of the network state when implementing boundary control. First, according to the data detected for the road network, the concept of a conditional value at risk is used to establish a risk decision model that considers the influence of the boundary input flow rate on sub-region state degradation. Then, based on the risk decision model, we propose a state transfer risk decision (STRD) perimeter control method for a large-scale traffic network with multiple sub-regions. This perimeter control method predicts the traffic demand of every sub-region, selects an acceptable traffic flow range at the sub-region boundary by risk interval, regards the maximum trip completion flow and the minimum total travel time as the decision-making objectives, and controls multiple sub-region boundaries. The simulation results show that compared with proportional integral (PI) control and no STRD (NSTRD) control, the STRD control scheme can effectively prevent the state transfer of all sub-regions, improve the trip completion flow, and decrease the travel delay of the network.}

abstract = {In today’s era of mega ships, rail is increasingly being recognized as an important and sustainable mode to transport containers in and out of congested marine terminals. However, rail’s potential impact on terminal and road congestion is highly dependent on the ability to fully utilize the available train space. This paper contributes to the literature by presenting an optimization model that can create high-utilization loading plans for double stack trains at marine terminals. To facilitate the solution of the model, it will be shown how the initial binary nonlinear model can be linearized. Model properties will also be derived and discussed. To illustrate the usefulness of the proposed model in a practical setting, a realistic case study is conducted. The results demonstrate that the model is able to find optimal loading plans for double-stack trains in realistic settings.}

The model is formulated in Lagrangian coordinates considering the heterogeneous behavior of human drivers. We further derive a first and second order approximation of the stochastic model describing the mean and the covariance dynamics, respectively, under different combinations of HVs and AVs in the traffic stream (e.g., randomly distributed in the stream, at the front of the stream, in the middle of the stream and in the rear of the stream). The proposed model allows us to explicitly investigate the interaction between AVs and HVs considering the uncertainty of human driving behavior. Six performance metrics are proposed to measure the impact of AVs on the uncertainty of HVs’ behavior, as well as on the stability of the system. The numerical experiment results show that AVs have significant impact on the uncertainty and stability of the mixed traffic flow system. Larger AV penetration rates can reduce the uncertainty inherent in HV behavior and improve the stability of the mixed flow substantially. Whereas AVs’ reaction time only has subtle impact on the uncertainty of the mixed stream; as well as the position of AVs in the traffic stream has marginal influence in terms of reducing uncertainty and improving stability.}

It contains two aspects: dynamic rebalancing within each station and static rebalancing among stations. Firstly, we give a new flow-type task window (F-window) by defining the consistency index of travelers. It is more suitable as a task window for rebalancing than time-type task window (T-window) based on three aspects analysis. Through three assumptions, the temporal-distribution learning model including task window and station storage configuration, are built to realize new dynamic rebalancing. The spatial-distribution learning method is introduced to divide management areas for static rebalancing. The empirical results show that F-window can better match the strong time-sensitive of demand fluctuation. Compared with traditional rebalancing needs hours, each rebalancing within a station can be completed within average 4 min. By setting the station storage configuration, it makes rebalancing in this paper meets the demand of 28.3 times the hourly rebalancing within one week. And the number of vehicles visiting stations has dropped below 20\%.}

abstract = {Energy efficiency of train operations is influenced largely by the speed control and the scheduled running time in the train timetable. In practice, the running time of a train is often determined in the train timetabling process at the macroscopic level while the energy-efficient speed control of a train on a segment is often determined at the microscopic level with the given timetable. They are usually optimized separately due to limited computational resources, which however may result in sub-optimal solutions. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel integrated micro-macro approach for better incorporating train energy-efficient speed control into the railway timetabling process. Firstly, we formulated the integrated train timetabling and speed control optimization problem as a nonlinear mixed-integer programming model. Due to its complexity, we reformulate it on the basis of flow conservation theory in a space–time-speed (STS) network and solve the problem in two steps. In the first step, a set of pre-solved energy-efficient train trajectory templates is generated by a segment-level optimization approach with consideration of train travel time, entry speed and exit speed to save computation time. In the second step, a near-optimum train energy-efficient timetable solution is found by a fast algorithm, which consists of the shortest generalized cost path algorithm, conflict detection and resolution algorithm, and calculation of dynamic headways between two successive trains. The numerical experiments demonstrate that the developed approach provides better outcomes than the benchmark case in terms of both train journey time and energy consumption.}

A cell-based map-matching technique is proposed to link vehicle trajectories with road geometries, and to produce network-wide spatio-temporal speed matrices. Data limitations are addressed using the Schatten p-norm matrix completion algorithm, which can minimize speed estimation errors even with high rates of data unavailability. A case study using data from Chengdu, China, demonstrates that the algorithm performs well even in situations involving continuous data loss over a few hours, and consequently, addresses large-scale network-wide traffic state estimation problems with missing data, while at the same time outperforming other data recovery techniques that were used as benchmarks. Our approach can be used to generate congestion maps that can help monitor and visualize traffic dynamics across the network, and therefore form the basis for new traffic management, proactive congestion identification, and congestion mitigation strategies.}

While some efforts have been made to understand why people would use AVs, few of them have investigated the role of social and personal factors in AV acceptance. The present study aimed to fill in this research gap. An AV acceptance model was proposed by extending the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with social and personal factors, i.e., initial trust, social influence, and the Big Five personality and sensation seeking traits. The validity of the proposed model was confirmed with a questionnaire survey administrated to 647 drivers in China. Results revealed that at the very beginning of AV commercialization, perception factors (i.e., perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness) from the original TAM showed significant influence on users’ intention to use AVs. But more importantly, it was social influence and initial trust that contributed most to explain whether users would accept AVs or not. Some personality traits also played certain roles in AV usage intention. In particular, sensation seekers and those with a higher openness to experience were more likely to trust AVs and had a higher intention to adopt them. In contrast, neurotic people showed a lower level of trust and were less likely to accept AVs. Practically, these findings suggest that promotion of AVs to influential individuals that could help form good social opinions would have significant downstream effects on AV acceptance at the early state of its marketization.}

The plan is however latent or unobserved as the driver may or may not be able to move to the target lane due to the constraints imposed by the surrounding traffic. Hence, only the actions of the driver (as manifested by their final lane occupancies) are observed in the trajectory data. This paper analyses such mandatory lane changing behaviour in a roadworks environment in detail with data from a controlled driving simulator experiment and a simple stated preference survey with the same group of participants. While in the former drivers face similar constraints in implementing the plans as in the real world, in the simple stated choice survey the same drivers elicit their preferred target lanes without a need to put the plan into action. We contrast the findings from the two sources and also show correlations between the latent plan and stated target components in a latent class model. The results provide new insights into lane changing behaviour that may be useful for example for traffic management purposes. Furthermore, using stated choice data potentially reduces the cost of data collection for model development.}

This shared automated mobility system is expected to provide a seamless door-to-door service for urban travellers, much like what the existing transportation network companies (TNC) do, but with decreased labour cost and more flexible relocation operations due to the vehicles’ automation. We propose an integer non-linear programming (INLP) model that optimizes the routing of the ATs to maximize the system profit, depending on dynamic travel times, which are a non-linear function of the ATs’ flows. It is important to involve traffic congestion in such a routing problem since for a growing number of ATs circulating in the city their number will lead to delays. The model is embedded within a rolling horizon framework, which divides a typical day into several horizons to deal with the real-time travel demand. In each horizon, the routing model is solved with the demand at that interval and assuring the continuity of the trips between horizons. Nevertheless, each horizon model is hard to solve given its number of constraints and decision variables. Therefore, we propose a solution approach based on a customized Lagrangian relaxation algorithm, which allows identifying a near-optimal solution for this difficult problem. Numerical experiments for the city of Delft, The Netherlands, are used to demonstrate the solution quality of the proposed algorithm as well as obtaining insights about the AT system performance. Results show that the solution algorithm can solve the proposed model for hard instances. Ride-sharing makes the AT system more capable to provide better service regarding delay time and the number of requests that can be attended by the system. The delay penalty on the profit objective function is an effective control parameter on guaranteeing the service quality while maintaining system profitability.}

With the gradual and rapid adoption of GPS-enabled smart devices in modern society, this task greatly benefits from the massive volume of GPS trajectories generated. However, existing identification approaches heavily rely on manual annotation of these trajectories with their accurate travel mode information, which is both economically inefficient and error-prone. In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised deep ensemble learning approach for travel mode identification to use a minimal number of annotated data for the task. The proposed approach accepts GPS trajectories of arbitrary lengths and extracts their latent information with a tailor-made feature engineering process. We devise a new deep neural network architecture to establish the mapping from this latent information domain to the final travel mode domain. An ensemble is accordingly constructed to develop proxy labels for unannotated data based on the rare annotated ones so that both types of data contribute to the learning process. Comprehensive case studies are conducted to assess the performance of the proposed approach, which notably outperforms existing ones with partially-labeled training data. Furthermore, we investigate its robustness to noisy data and the effectiveness of its constituting components.}

Since the maintenance provider is typically not the owner of a wind farm, it needs to adhere minimum service requirements that specify the required service. We consider three of such settings: (1) perform all maintenance tasks, (2) allow for a fraction of unscheduled tasks, and (3) incentivize to perform maintenance rather quickly. We provide a two-stage stochastic mixed integer programming model for the three SMFTPO settings, and solve it by means of Sample Average Approximation. In addition, we provide an overview of the, what we discovered, non-aligned modeling assumptions in the literature regarding operational decisions. By providing a series of special cases of the second-stage problem resembling the different modeling assumptions, we aim to establish a common consensus regarding the key modeling decisions to be taken in maintenance planning problems for offshore wind farms. We provide newly constructed, and publicly available, benchmark sets. We extensively compare the different SMFTPO settings and its special cases on those benchmark sets, and we show that the special case reformulations are very effective for solving the second-stage problems. In addition, we find that for particular cases, established modeling techniques result in overestimations and increased running times.}

The primary objective of this paper is to improve estimation of the network travel time reliability with network partitioning. We partition a heterogeneous large-scale network into homogeneous regions (clusters) with well-defined Network Fundamental Diagrams (NFD) using directional and non-directional partitioning approaches. To estimate the network travel time reliability, a linear relationship is estimated that relates the mean travel time with the standard deviation of travel time per unit of distance at the network level. The impact of different partitioning approaches, as well as the number of clusters, on the network travel time reliability relationship are also explored. To estimate individual vehicle travel times, we use two distinct approaches to allocate vehicle trajectories to different time intervals, namely trajectory and sub-trajectory methods. We apply the proposed framework to a large-scale network of Chicago using a 24-h dynamic traffic simulation. Partitioning and travel time reliability estimation are conducted for both morning and afternoon peak periods to demonstrate the impacts of travel demand pattern variations. The numerical results show that the sub-trajectory method for the network travel time reliability estimation and the directional partitioning with three clusters have the highest performance among other tested methods. The analyses also demonstrate that partitioning a heterogeneous network into homogeneous clusters may improve network travel reliability estimation by estimating an independent relationship for each cluster. Also, comparing morning and afternoon peak periods suggests that the estimated parameter for the linear network travel time reliability relationship is directly related to the coefficient of variation of density as a measure of spatial distribution of congestion across the network.}

abstract = {Whereas deep neural network (DNN) is increasingly applied to choice analysis, it is challenging to reconcile domain-specific behavioral knowledge with generic-purpose DNN, to improve DNN’s interpretability and predictive power, and to identify effective regularization methods for specific tasks. To address these challenges, this study demonstrates the use of behavioral knowledge for designing a particular DNN architecture with alternative-specific utility functions (ASU-DNN) and thereby improving both the predictive power and interpretability. Unlike a fully connected DNN (F-DNN), which computes the utility value of an alternative k by using the attributes of all the alternatives, ASU-DNN computes it by using only k’s own attributes. Theoretically, ASU-DNN can substantially reduce the estimation error of F-DNN because of its lighter architecture and sparser connectivity, although the constraint of alternative-specific utility can cause ASU-DNN to exhibit a larger approximation error. Empirically, ASU-DNN has 2–3\% higher prediction accuracy than F-DNN over the whole hyperparameter space in a private dataset collected in Singapore and a public dataset available in the R mlogit package. The alternative-specific connectivity is associated with the independence of irrelevant alternative (IIA) constraint, which as a domain-knowledge-based regularization method is more effective than the most popular generic-purpose explicit and implicit regularization methods and architectural hyperparameters. ASU-DNN provides a more regular substitution pattern of travel mode choices than F-DNN does, rendering ASU-DNN more interpretable. The comparison between ASU-DNN and F-DNN also aids in testing behavioral knowledge. Our results reveal that individuals are more likely to compute utility by using an alternative’s own attributes, supporting the long-standing practice in choice modeling. Overall, this study demonstrates that behavioral knowledge can guide the architecture design of DNN, function as an effective domain-knowledge-based regularization method, and improve both the interpretability and predictive power of DNN in choice analysis. Future studies can explore the generalizability of ASU-DNN and other possibilities of using utility theory to design DNN architectures.}

First, we revisit the parking pricing scheme at P + R parking facility with parking restraint and find that it fails to eliminate extra costs arising from competition for inadequate parking spots. Fortunately, competition for inadequate parking spots can be eliminated by a strategy of parking permits distribution. Then we investigate the optimal number of parking permits distributed to each OD pair in a many-to-one park and ride network. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). However, parking permit management is less efficient than parking pricing at P + R facility when parking provision is sufficient. Therefore, we propose two hybrid management schemes with parking pricing and parking permit to reduce system travel cost. Joint implementation of parking pricing and parking permit not only alleviates the traffic congestion but also eliminates the competition for inadequate parking space. Next, the bi-level programming models are proposed to determine the optimal parking fees at P + R parking facilities in the hybrid management schemes. In the bi-level programming models, the number of parking permits assigned or held by each OD pair is an implicit function with respect to parking fee. A global optimum oriented solution algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm are used to solve the MILP and bi-level programming models respectively. Numerical examples are carried out to show that the hybrid schemes with parking pricing and parking permits are more effective than both pure parking pricing scheme and pure parking permits management scheme.}

Factors influencing takeover performance, such as takeover lead time and the engagement of non-driving-related tasks, have been studied in the past. However, despite the important role emotions play in human-machine interaction and in manual driving, little is known about how emotions influence drivers’ takeover performance. This study, therefore, examined the effects of emotional valence and arousal on drivers’ takeover timeliness and quality in conditionally automated driving. We conducted a driving simulation experiment with 32 participants. Movie clips were played for emotion induction. Participants with different levels of emotional valence and arousal were required to take over control from automated driving, and their takeover time and quality were analyzed. Results indicate that positive valence led to better takeover quality in the form of a smaller maximum resulting acceleration and a smaller maximum resulting jerk. However, high arousal did not yield an advantage in takeover time. This study contributes to the literature by demonstrating how emotional valence and arousal affect takeover performance. The benefits of positive emotions carry over from manual driving to conditionally automated driving while the benefits of arousal do not.}

The optimal control is formulated based upon the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation of kinematic wave model. Following the problem decomposition under the decentralised scheme, we introduce the use of semi-analytical performance derivatives when developing the decentralised solution algorithm. The proposed control strategies are applied to a set of test scenarios constructed from a real road network in Central London in the UK. Specific interests in the investigation include comparison of the performance gain and computational effort of the two strategies under different circumstances. We also investigate effect of network decomposition strategies on the performance of the solution algorithm. This study generates insight on urban traffic management with use of traffic flow theory, decentralised optimisation, and network decomposition techniques.}

A model-predictive control algorithm is also used so that time-varying metering rates are generated based on their forecasted impacts. Our scalable algorithm can do this for an arbitrary number of cordoned neighborhoods within a city. Unlike its predecessors, the proposed model accounts for the time-varying constraining effects that cordon queues impose on a neighborhood’s circulating traffic, as those queues expand and recede over time. The model does so at every time step by approximating a neighborhood’s street space occupied by cordon queues, and re-scaling the MFD to describe the state of circulating traffic that results. The model also differentiates between saturated and under-saturated cordon-metering operations. Computer simulations of an idealized network show that these enhancements can substantially improve the predictions of both, the trip completion rates in a neighborhood and the rates that vehicles cross metered cordons. Optimal metering policies generated as a result are similarly shown to do a better job in reducing the Vehicle Hours Traveled on the network. The VHT reductions stemming from the proposed model and from its predecessors differed by as much as 14\%.}

A strategy to deal with this randomness is bus injection, in which buses are kept in specific points along the route ready to be dispatched when an event such as an extremely long headway occurs. In this work, a stochastic model based on the second moment of the headways distribution is developed to determine if one or more buses are worth reserving for injection in a public transport service. A single stop approach is initially used to determine an expression for the optimal headway threshold triggering the injection. Then, a model for the complete service is developed and used to determine when the empty bus should be injected within the headway once the decision to inject it has been taken. We show that the bus should be injected approximately when 57\% of the headway has passed. Simulations with real data are used to test the proposed model, proving its accuracy in terms of measuring the impact on waiting times. The results show that reserving a bus to be injected can be better than operating the entire fleet continuously.}

This study extends the analysis to a two-dimensional network, in which several alternative routes exist for each OD, with consideration of the route choice behaviours of users. Our proposed method employs sequential Bayesian filtering with a cell transmission model (CTM) for the flow model and probe vehicle data. From the probe vehicle data, not only cell densities but also diverging ratios are assumed to be measured and these measurements are assimilated into the flow model.

abstract = {Emergent cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) strategies being proposed for platoon formation in the connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) context mostly assume idealized fixed information flow topologies (IFTs) for the platoon, implying guaranteed vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications for the IFT assumed. In reality, V2V communications are unreliable due to failures resulting from communication-related constraints such as interference and information congestion. Since CACC strategies entail continuous information broadcasting, communication failures can occur in congested CAV traffic networks, leading to a platoon’s IFT varying dynamically. To explicitly factor IFT dynamics and to leverage it to enhance the performance of CACC strategies, this study proposes the idea of dynamically optimizing the IFT for CACC, labeled the CACC-OIFT strategy. Under CACC-OIFT, the vehicles in the platoon cooperatively determine in real-time which vehicles will dynamically deactivate or activate the “send” functionality of their V2V communication devices to generate IFTs that optimize the platoon performance in terms of string stability under the ambient traffic conditions. The CACC-OIFT consists of an IFT optimization model and an adaptive Proportional-Derivative (PD) controller. Given the adaptive PD controller with a two-predecessor-following scheme, and the ambient traffic conditions and the platoon size just before the start of a time period, the IFT optimization model determines the optimal IFT that maximizes the expected string stability in terms of the energy of speed oscillations. This expectation is because each IFT has specific degeneration scenarios whose probabilities are determined by the communication failure probabilities for that time period based on the ambient traffic conditions. The optimal IFT is deployed for that time period, and the adaptive PD controller continuously determines the car-following behaviors of the vehicles based on the unfolding degeneration scenario for each time instant within that period. The effectiveness of the proposed CACC-OIFT is validated through numerical experiments in NS-3 based on NGSIM field data. The results indicate that the proposed CACC-OIFT can significantly enhance the string stability of platoon control in an unreliable V2V communication context, outperforming CACCs with fixed IFTs or with passive adaptive schemes for IFT dynamics.}

There is a growing literature on express services that focuses on route design and performance evaluation. In this work, we study a simplified transit corridor where a regular service operates in tandem with an end-to-end express service. Assuming that passengers minimize their expected travel and waiting times, we show that, even if the system has enough aggregate capacity, it may present a specific range of frequencies for the express service where it attracts more demand than it can actually fulfill. We call this range the “danger zone” of express services. When frequencies fall within the danger zone, a queue of passengers will form at the station. Applying queuing theory, we obtain expressions to estimate these queues and the associated waiting times, expected travel times and social costs of the system. We show that even when the station has unlimited passenger capacity, the performance of the system can be greatly affected in the danger zone. If the station has indeed limited capacity, the scenario can be much worse: if the queue grows to the point of saturating the station, a vicious circle ensues that amplifies the negative effects of the danger zone.}

abstract = {This paper examines the time-dependent bus dispatching problem in a multi-modal context. Traditional studies along this line often optimize the bus frequency or schedule. However, they may fail as the realized bus frequency or schedule is constrained by the time-varying traffic congestion on the road. Adding more buses to service does not necessarily increase the service frequency. Given this, we look into the time-dependent bus dispatching (number of buses in service on road) when taking into account complex multi-modal and multi-directional flow interactions on the road. In particular, the traffic dynamics over clock time is modeled through an aggregate traffic representation with flow interactions between cars and buses, and interactions between traffic in opposite moving directions. Instead of explicitly optimizing the size of dispatched bus fleet, we propose an adaptive fleet size adjustment mechanism where we have a target level of bus loading factor. This adaptive or responsive approach, by taking advantage of the doubly dynamical system proposed in Liu and Geroliminis (2017), adjusts the size of dispatched bus fleet over calendar time and accommodates day-to-day variations of mode choices and traffic patterns. Numerical studies show that the proposed approach can help bus operator to reduce operating cost and improve net benefit while maintaining comparable user costs for passengers. This study offers a new perspective for dynamic bus dispatching strategy and improves our understanding of multi-modal traffic dynamics.}

The main premise is that the heterogeneity in preferred acceleration rate, desired speed, and car-following (CF) behavior (e.g., reaction pattern and sensitivity to a traffic disturbance) will change traffic properties in ways that can undermine traffic flow throughput. This paper first decomposes the mechanism into two elements – one driven by acceleration and one by time-varying CF response to disturbances – and then investigates their compounded effect. This paper also provides unifying frameworks to analyze the behavior of RVs and CAVs to facilitate analytical investigations. The results reveal how heterogeneous acceleration and CF behavior may create persistent voids and diminish traffic throughput. Integrating all the elements, throughput reduction is quantified via numerical simulations.}

The surrogate model is further enhanced by the reproducing kernel Hilbert space and adaptive sampling to reduce approximation error and improve computational efficiency. To solve the proposed surrogate-based DUE problem on reduced networks, we develop a customized algorithm that integrates the kernel trick with the generalized projection framework. A pre-computation scheme is proposed, which calculates and stores the of kernel matrices and vectors, could further reduce the computational burden. Numerical experiments of the proposed methods show significant reduction of the computational times, by up to 90\%, while maintaining low approximation errors (MAPE below 6\%), when compared to the exact models and solution methods.}

The proposed framework extends the existing variational theory (VT) approaches by: (i) introducing a probabilistic VT graph, where the costs are computed using an efficient stochastic shortest path algorithm; (ii) capturing the effects of stochastic moving bus bottlenecks and the correlation of bus arrival times; (iii) incorporating a macroscopic passenger model that reflects the passenger dynamics for the different modes; and (iv) accounting for the effects that the traffic conditions might have on bus operations. Using a Monte-Carlo simulation and empirical data from a bi-modal corridor in Zurich, Switzerland, we not only successfully validate the results yielded by our stochastic VT approach, but also show its applicability on a real corridor. A comparison with a deterministic VT approach reveals the value of the proposed framework, especially for corridors with a high bus frequency and considerable stochasticity. The results demonstrate that incorporating stochasticity and the traffic conditions is essential if buses run with relatively short and variable headways. Moreover, we introduce an innovative application example for the evaluation of different bus lane layouts, aiming to maximize the passenger throughput along a bi-modal urban corridor. The application example shows that the proposed framework can be used as an efficient modeling tool for practitioners. In particular, it can be used to identify a proper lane allocation strategy by computing the critical density of cars when a mixed lane should be switched to a dedicated bus lane or vice versa. It is important to note that such application would not have been possible without our proposed VT extensions, which account for both passenger dynamics and the impact of traffic conditions. Finally, given that the proposed methodology is generic, it can be easily extended to various traffic problems involving stochasticity.}

By assessing requirements and opportunities, the controller aims to limit consecutive delays resulting from trains that entered a control area behind schedule by sequencing them at a critical location in a timely manner, thus representing the practical requirements of railway operations. This approach depends on an approximation to the value function of dynamic programming after optimisation from a specified state, which is estimated dynamically from operational experience using reinforcement learning techniques. By using this approximation, the ADP avoids extensive explicit evaluation of performance and so reduces the computational burden substantially. In this investigation, we explore formulations of the approximation function and variants of the learning techniques used to estimate it. Evaluation of the ADP methods in a stochastic simulation environment shows considerable improvements in consecutive delays by comparison with the current industry practice of First-Come-First-Served sequencing. We also found that estimates of parameters of the approximate value function are similar across a range of test scenarios with different mean train entry delays.}

The various taxi services provide similar door-to-door rides, thus compete with each other. Meanwhile, the expanding fleet size of e-hailing taxis, together with considerable number of traditional taxicabs, influence the urban road network performance, which can also in turn affect taxi mode choice and operation. In this study, we propose an innovative modeling structure for the competitive taxi market and capture the interactions not only within the taxi market but also between the taxi market and urban road system. The model is built on a network linking a certain number of queues, derived from both the taxi and urban road system. Considering both the passenger and vehicle arrivals, we utilize an assembly-like queue SM/M/1 for passenger-vehicle matching within the taxi system, which controls how many and how frequently vehicles drive from the taxi system to the urban road system. A common multi-server M/M/c queue that can account for road capacity is proposed for the urban road system and a feedback of network states is sent back to the taxi system. Then the stationary state distributions, as well as asymptotic properties, of the queueing network are discussed. An example is designed based on data from New York City. Numerical results show that the proposed modeling structure, together with the corresponding approximation method, can capture dynamics within high demand areas and, in particular, a spatially balanced system. Overall, this study shows how the queueing network approach can measure aggregated performance of various taxi services, for instance, not only the waiting/searching time during passenger-vehicle matching but also the delays in the urban road network. Furthermore, the model can be generalized to study the control and management of taxi markets.}

The discrete nature of travel behavior naturally leads to limited observability. We overcome this problem by designing a measurement function from which additional information can be solicited. Additionally, the inherent trade-offs between factors that affect travel choices result in an infinite set of solutions. We thus propose two solutions: (1) the divide and conquer strategy in which a multi-dimensional conditional probability function is proposed; and (2) use of domain knowledge to restrict that preference values fall in certain ranges and are consistent with certain distributions. The performance of preference learning with these two solutions applied is shown via simulation tests and an online experiment involving human participants. For departure time choices, we show an average acceptance ratio of 0.68 for all participants when being promoted with alternatives with personalized incentives. We also show that changes in individual departure time choices will lead to 48\% reduction in total travel time on a simple transportation network.}

Unlike existing freight assignment models, we focus on the interactions between individual truck operators that solely compete for loads advertised on an online freight exchange. The competitors are assumed to follow optimal bidding and routing strategies – represented using a hyperpath – to maximize their expected profit. The proposed DTE model (1) predicts system-wide truck flows (including empty truck flows), (2) identifies efficiency improvements gained by network-wide visibility, and (3) lays the foundation for building a system optimal model. We rewrite the DTE conditions as a variational inequality problem (VIP) and discuss the analytical properties of the formulation, including solution existence. A heuristic solution algorithm is developed to solve the VIP, which consists of three modules: a dynamic network loading procedure for mapping hyperpath flows onto the freight network, a column generation scheme for creating hyperpaths as needed, and a method of successive average for equilibrating profits on existing hyperpaths. The model and the solution algorithm are validated by numerical experiments constructed from empirical data collected in China. The results show that the DTE solutions outperform with wide margin the benchmark solutions that either ignore inter-truck interactions or operate trucks according to suboptimal routing and bidding decisions.}

To address this question, a joint transit network redesign and SAMS fleet size determination problem (JTNR-SFSDP) is introduced, and a bi-level mathematical programming formulation and solution approach are presented. The upper-level problem modifies a transit network frequency setting problem (TNFSP) formulation via incorporating SAMS fleet size as a decision variable and allowing the removal of bus routes. The lower-level problem consists of a dynamic combined mode choice-traveler assignment problem (DCMC-TAP) formulation. The heuristic solution procedure involves solving the upper-level problem using a nonlinear programming solver and solving the lower-level problem using an iterative agent-based assignment-simulation approach. To illustrate the effectiveness of the modeling framework, this study uses traveler demand from Chicago along with the region’s existing multimodal transit network. The computational results indicate significant traveler benefits, in terms of improved average traveler wait times, associated with optimizing the joint design of multimodal transit networks and SAMS fleets compared with the initial transit network design.}

abstract = {The fundamental challenge of the origin-destination (OD) matrix estimation problem is that it is severely under-determined. In this paper we propose a new data driven OD estimation method for cases where a supply pattern in the form of speeds and flows is available. We show that with these input data, we do not require an iterative dynamic network loading procedure that results in an equilibrium assignment, nor do we need an assumption on the kind of equilibrium that emerges from this process. The minimal number of ingredients which are needed are (a) a method to estimate/predict production and attraction time series; (b) a method to compute the N shortest paths from each OD zone to the next; and (c) two—possibly OD-specific—assumptions on the magnitude of N; and on the proportionality of path flows between these origins and destinations, respectively. The latter constitutes the most important behavioral assumption in our method, which relates to how we assume travelers have chosen their routes between OD pairs. We choose a proportionality factor that is inversely proportional to realized travel time, where we incorporate a penalty for path overlap. For large networks, these ingredients may be insufficient to solve the resulting system of equations. We show how additional constraints can be derived directly from the data by using principal component analysis, with which we exploit the fact that temporal patterns of production and attraction are similar across the network. Experimental results on a toy network and a large city network (Santander, Spain) show that our OD estimation method works satisfactorily, given a reasonable choice of N, and the use of so-called 3D supply patterns, which provide a compact representation of the supply dynamics over the entire network. Inclusion of topological information makes the method scalable both in terms of network size and for different topologies. Although we use a neural network to predict production and attraction in our experiments (which implies ground-truth OD data were needed), there are straight-forward paths to improve the method using additional data, such as demographic data, household survey data, social media and or movement traces, which could support estimating such ground-truth baseline production and attraction patterns. The proposed framework would fit very nicely in an online traffic modeling and control framework, and we see many paths to further refine and improve the method.}

abstract = {Sags and tunnels are major bottlenecks, where the road capacity is reduced, and the “capacity drop” phenomenon occurs; however, there is no simple model or theory that can explain the formation and other characteristics of capacity drop. This paper presents a car-following model, which is equivalent to a continuum model in the Lagrangian coordinates. The model is built on two main assumptions: (i) inhomogeneous fundamental diagrams with location-dependent time gaps, and (ii) bounded acceleration. We first demonstrate that the stationary speed profiles, the low acceleration rates, the dropped capacity, and the approximate time duration of the capacity drop formation in the model are consistent with empirical observations. Then the impacts on the stationary states and dropped capacity of the numerical viscosity caused by the discretization method are investigated, and it is shown that the dropped capacity converges to the theoretical value. Further, a one-dimensional iterated function system is proposed to model the formation mechanism of the capacity drop, which is derived by investigating the spatial pattern of equilibrium and bounded acceleration traffic states that arises in a lead-vehicle problem. Utilizing this model, we uncover a set of properties of the capacity drop such as existence, uniqueness, global convergence, and convergence speed. Finally, the model is applied to analyze the impacts of heterogeneous drivers. The model and insights in this study will help to develop control and management schemes to alleviate capacity drop effects with connected and autonomous vehicles in the future.}

The proposed framework allows for the consideration of perception subjectivity and judgement errors that may lead to unsafe acceleration driving maneuvers with the possibility of real-end collisions. The modeling approach relies on a generalized utility-based formulation with three specific types of subjective utility functions (SUFs): Prospect Utility (PT) subjective utility function, Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) subjective utility function, and an Exponential Constant Relative Risk Aversion (ECRA) subjective utility function. The formulation is assessed in terms of its homogeneous macroscopic properties (thus leading to a triangular fundamental diagram) and its non-homogeneous microscopic properties (thus leading to realistic following behavior facing different traffic scenarios). Once tested in terms of feasibility, the modeling approach is calibrated against real-life trajectory data. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) method is adopted to minimize a spacing-mixed-error term while considering inter-driving heterogeneity. The three models (i.e. PT, CRRA and ECRA) produce acceptable error values with the PT model showing the best fit, followed by the ECRA model, followed by the CRRA model. Even though the CRRA and the PT models show similar intensity in the acceleration response to the behavior of a lead vehicle with more disturbance (stochasticity/randomness) seen with the CRRA SUF, the PT and the ECRA models show more realistic wave formation despite their difference in terms of individual acceleration distribution functions. The ECRA model results in an amplified sensitivity to the behavior of the lead vehicle with the acceleration probability distribution function skewed to the left (i.e. towards decelerating rather than accelerating). The calibration exercise is followed by a simulation exercise. The three suggested models produce a homogeneous congestion phase, but a clear transient single/multiple wave formation is seen with the PT and the ECRA models. These latter models are able to reproduce all the congestion regimes observed on real-world surface transportation networks. The ECRA is characterized by a decreased capacity and increased traffic disturbances with additional shockwave formation. Finally, the different models allow the possibility of perception or judgement errors with the explicit incorporation of a collision probability and a collision weight in the suggested formulation approach.}

This study considers estimating the cumulative flow over space and time, i.e., N(x,t), using relative flow data collected by stationary and moving observers. Stationary observers, e.g., loop-detectors, can observe flow at fixed position over time. Furthermore, automated or other equipped and connected vehicles can serve as moving observers that observe flow relative to their position over time. To present the value of relative flow data, in this paper, we take the perspective of a model-based estimation approach. In this approach, the data is used in two processes: (1) information assimilation of real-time data and models and (2) learning of the models used in information assimilation based on historical data. This paper focuses on traffic state estimation on links. However, we explain that, in absence of stationary observer that are positioned at the link boundaries, it is valuable to consider the information propagation over nodes. Throughout this study a LWR-model with a triangular fundamental diagram (FD) is used to develop the principles that can be used for the two processes. These principles are tested in a simulation (VISSIM) study. This study shows that we can find the traffic flow model parameters and can partially estimate the link boundary conditions based on relative flow data collected by moving observers alone. It also shows that the traffic flow behavior differs partially from the LWR-model with triangular FD, and therefore, we recommend the option to learn and use other traffic flow models in future research. Overall, relative flow data is considered valuable to obtain model learning datasets and to estimate the traffic state.}

It aims at reducing peak-hour congestion in the urban transit system with alternative options catering for various commuters. In the H-FRS, a commuter will be rewarded with a free ride during the periods preceding or following a given shoulder period after taking a certain number of paid rides during the central period in peak hours. In the H-UFS, a commuter needs to pay a different but uniform fare during peak hours. Commuters will have the opportunity to join either of the sub-schemes according to their scheduling flexibility of departure time choice. The hybrid fare scheme determines the free fare intervals, the rewarding ratio, and the new fares for the sub-schemes. Our results demonstrate that the proposed HFS is not only revenue-preserving but also Pareto-improving. Depending on the original fare, an optimally designed hybrid fare scheme can achieve a reduction in total time costs by at least 25\% with the optimal free fare interval.}

However, it is still problematic for private operators to share data with the public due to risks to competitive advantages. A privacy control algorithm is proposed to overcome this key obstacle for private operators sharing complex network-oriented data objects. The algorithm is based on information-theoretic k-anonymity and, using tour data as an example, where an operator’s data is used in conjunction with performance measure accuracy controls to synthesize a set of alternative tours with diffused probabilities for sampling during a query. The algorithm is proven to converge sublinearly toward a constrained maximum entropy under certain asymptotic conditions with measurable gap. Computational experiments verify the applicability to multi-vehicle fleet tour data; they confirm that reverse engineered parameters from the diffused data result in controllable sampling error; and tests conducted on a set of realistic routing records from travel data in Long Island, NY, demonstrate the use of the methodology from both the adversary and user perspectives.}

However, current literature on the demand-driven bus scheduling generally assumes fixed bus capacity and exclusively optimizes bus dispatch headways. With the advent of connected and autonomous vehicle technology and the introduction of autonomous minibus/shuttle, the joint design of bus capacity and dispatch headway holds promises to further improving the system efficiency while reducing operating and passenger costs. This paper formulates this problem as an integer nonlinear programming model for transit systems operating with mixed human-driven and autonomous buses. In such mixed operating environment, the model simultaneously considers: (1) dynamic capacity design of autonomous bus, i.e., autonomous buses with varying capacity can be obtained by assembling and/or dissembling multiple autonomous minibuses; (2) trajectory control of autonomous bus, i.e., autonomous bus can dynamically adjust its running time as a function of its forward and backward headways; and (3) stop-level passenger boarding and alighting behavior. The objective of the model is designed to balance the trade-off between the operating costs of dispatching different types of bus and the costs of increased passenger waiting time due to inadequate bus dispatching. The model is solved using a dynamic programming approach. We show that the proposed model is effective in reducing passenger waiting time and total operating cost. Sensitivity analysis is further conducted to explore the impact of miscellaneous factors on optimal dispatching decisions, such as penetration rate of autonomous bus, bus running time variation, and passenger demand level.}

In this paper, we present a semiparametric regression modelling framework to determine the underlying drivers of journey time variance in urban metro systems, using the London Underground as a case study. We merge train location and passenger trip data to decompose total journey times into three constituent parts: access times as passengers enter the system, on-train times, and egress times as passengers exit at their destinations. For each journey time component, we estimate non-linear functional relationships which we then use to derive elasticity estimates of journey times with respect to service supply and demand factors, including operational and physical characteristics of metros as well as passenger demand and passenger-specific travel characteristics. We find that the static fixed physical characteristics of stations and routes have the greatest influence on journey time, followed by train speeds, and headways, for which the average elasticities of total journey time are −0.54 and 0.05, respectively. The results of our analysis could inform operators about where potential interventions should be targeted in order to improve journey time performance.}

With the objective to improve road safety, this paper develops an on-line approach for vehicle running state monitoring and aggressive driving identification, using kinematic parameters captured by the in-vehicle recorder under naturalistic driving conditions. To characterize the roads in reality, a novel road conceptual model is proposed. It accounts for not only the curve on the horizontal plane but also the slope on the vertical plane, as well as the cross slope. For each position where the vehicle is driving, the vehicle motion is decomposed into two circular motions on the horizontal and vertical planes. On each plane, the vehicle maneuver is first identified. Then, aggressive driving is identified according to the limit equilibrium of driving safety or comfortability. Based on the proposed method called “three-elements”, the vehicle maneuver, radius and slope angle on the vertical plane can be solved in an on-line manner. The novel approach is an elaborate analytical model with clear physical meaning but small computation load, and therefore is potential to be implemented in the mobile devices to assist in real-time aggressive driving identification and labeling. The developed approach is applied to a real case on the curved and sloped route in Nanjing, China. Empirical results of extensive experiments, based on the kinematic parameters collected from the in-vehicle data recorder under naturalistic driving conditions, demonstrate that aggressive driving behaviors are mostly found on the pavements with curve and slope, and can be identified by the developed approach.}

However, as of now, automated entities do not necessarily outperform human drivers under all circumstances, particularly under certain road and environmental factors such as bright light, heavy rain, poor quality of road and traffic signs, etc. Therefore, in certain conditions it is safer for the driver to take over the control of the vehicle. However, switching control back and forth between the human driver and the automated driving entity may itself pose a short-term, elevated risk, particularly because of the out of the loop (OOTL) issue for humans. In this study, we develop a mathematical framework to determine the optimal driving-entity switching policy between the automated driving entity and the human driver. Specifically, we develop a Markov decision process (MDP) model to prescribe the entity in charge to minimize the expected safety cost of a trip, considering the dynamic changes of the road/environment during the trip. In addition, we develop a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model to accommodate the fact that the risk posed by the immediate road/environment may only be partially observed. We conduct extensive numerical experiments and thorough sensitivity and robustness analyses, where we also compare the expected safety cost of trips under the optimal and single driving entity policies. In addition, we quantify the risks associated with the policies, as well as the impact of miss-estimating road/environment condition risk level by the driving entities, and provide insights. The proposed frameworks can be used as a policy tool to identify factors that can render a region suitable for level four autonomy.}

This paper proposes a two-phase model for optimizing trip planning and operations by integrating a ride-sharing process in short-notice evacuations, to allow a joint optimization of driver-rider matching and necessary transfer connections among shared vehicle trips. In the first phase, following network topology information and personal requests, a vehicle-space-time hyper dimensional network is developed by constructing vehicle-space-time vertexes and arcs. In the second phase, based on the constructed vehicle-space-time network, a new time-discretized multi-rider multi-driver network flow model is built to formulate ride-sharing with connecting transfers. A Lagrangian relaxation solution approach is designed to solve the model in a real-world network scenario. Numerical analyses are conducted with considerations given to the three operating parameters (detour tolerance of driver, penalty factor for transfer time, and maximum allowable parking time) in the method, and the analysis results show that the proposed model can not only meet the evacuation trip needs of the participating parties but it also supports personalized requests and on-demand accesses. A small sample network is used to theoretically test the whole model and the underlying concepts and solution strategy to show each step implemented in details, and finally the applicability of the method is demonstrated using the Chicago City network.}

Ubiquitous mobile phones and data generated from the events of these mobile devices provide a promising approach for traffic status detection. This paper proposes a novel approach solely using cellular event data without the cellphone GPS information to detect traffic status on arterial roads. Different from the conventional methods, the proposed approach uses features derived only from cellular data to estimate traffic status, not requiring any cellphone location information. Both handoff (HO) and location update (LU) events generated at each cellular station were extracted from the original data to form a candidate feature set. A feature selection method based on joint mutual information (JMI) was used to select features to cover the maximum information, which can resolve issues such as loss of useful information caused by conventional feature selection techniques. A support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was then employed to model the relationship between the selected features and traffic status (low, medium, and high-traffic). Finally, the proposed method was validated by both a field experiment in Taicang, China with 1-hour-time-interval samples and a simulation experiment on VISSIM with 5-minute-time-interval samples. This study provides a new perspective for traffic status detection which may help design strategies for traffic management and route navigation to improve traveling efficiency, especially for the cities lack of traffic surveillance devices.}

It can be estimated based on empirical or simulation data, or approximated analytically. Two main analytical approximation methods to derive the MFD for arterial roads and urban networks exist at the moment. These are the method of cuts (MoC) and related approaches, as well as the stochastic approximation (SA). This paper systematically evaluates these methods including their most recent advancements for the case of an urban arterial MFD. Both approaches are evaluated based on a traffic data set for a segment of an arterial in the city of Munich, Germany. This data set includes loop detector and signal data for a typical working day. It is found that the deterministic MoC finds a more accurate upper bound for the MFD for the studied case. The estimation error of the stochastic method is about three times higher than the one of the deterministic method. However, the SA outperforms the MoC in approximating the free-flow branch of the MFD. The analysis of the discrepancies between the empirical and the analytical MFDs includes an investigation of the measurement bias and an in-depth sensitivity study of signal control and public transport operation related input parameters. This study is conducted as a Monte-Carlo-Simulation based on a Latin Hypercube sampling. Interestingly, it is found that applying the MoC for a high number of feasible green-to-cycle ratios predicts the empirical MFD well. Overall, it is concluded that the availability of signal data can improve the analytical approximation of the MFD even for a highly inhomogeneous arterial.}

The use of UAVs raises a series of restrictions and considerations that did not appear previously in routing problems; most notably, aspects such as the limited power-life of batteries used by the UAVs and the determination of rendezvous points where they are replaced by fully-charged new batteries. These difficulties have until now limited the mathematical formulation of truck-drone routing problems and their resolution to mainly small-size cases. To overcome these limitations we propose an iterated greedy heuristic based on the iterative process of destruction and reconstruction of solutions. This process is orchestrated by a global optimization scheme using a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. We test our approach in a large set of instances of different sizes taken from literature. The obtained results are quite promising, even for large-size scenarios.}

Autonomous driving technology enables vehicles to follow the instructions sent from the controller precisely. Autonomous intersection management considers each vehicle as an agent and coordinates vehicle trajectories to resolve vehicle conflicts inside an intersection. This study proposes an autonomous intersection management algorithm called AIM-ped considering both vehicles and pedestrians which is able to produce the total optimal throughput when combined with max pressure control. This study analyzes the stability properties of the algorithm based on a simpler version of AIM-ped, which is a conflict region model of the autonomous intersection management. To implement the proposed algorithm in simulation, this study combines the max-pressure control with an existing trajectory optimization algorithm to calculate optimal vehicle trajectories. Simulations are conducted to test the effects of pedestrian demand on intersection efficiency. The simulation results show that delays of pedestrians and vehicles are negatively correlated and the proposed algorithm can adapt to the change in the pedestrian demand and activate vehicle movements with conflicting trajectories.}

The problem is to determine the optimal locations of EV charging stations in a network under a limited budget that minimize the accumulated range anxiety of concerned travelers over the entire trips. A compact mixed-integer nonlinear programming model is first developed for the problem without resorting to the path and detailed charging pattern pre-generation. After examining the convexity of the model, we propose an efficient outer-approximation method to obtain the ε-optimal solution to the model. The model is then extended to incorporate the charging impedance, e.g., the charging time and cost. Numerical experiments in a 25-node benchmark network and a real-life Texas highway network demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed models and solution method and analyze the impact of the battery capacity, path deviation tolerance, budget and the subset of OD pairs on the optimal solution and the performance of the system.}

This paper investigates, on the one hand, how travel information affects route choice behaviour, and on the other hand, the impact of the travel time representation on the interpretation of parameter estimates and prediction accuracy. To this end, we estimate recursive models using data from an innovative data collection effort consisting of route choice observation data from GPS trackers, travel diaries and link travel times on the overall network. Though such combined data sets exist, these have not yet been used to investigate route choice behaviour. A dynamic network in which travel times change over time has been used for the estimation of both recursive logit and nested models. Prediction and estimation results are compared to those obtained for a static network. The interpretation of parameter estimates and prediction accuracy differ substantially between dynamic and static networks as well as between models with correlated and uncorrelated utilities. Contrary to the static results, for the dynamic, where travel times are modelled more accurately, travel information does not have a significant impact on route choice behaviour. However, having travel information increases the travel comfort, as interviews with participants have shown.}

In this article we present a generic framework for the conflict resolution problem that clearly separates the trajectory and conflict models from the resolution. It is able to handle any kind of maneuver and detection models, though we propose our own realistic 3D maneuvers and conflict detection that takes into account uncertainties on the positioning of aircraft. Based on these models, realistic scenarios are built, for which potential conflicts are detected using an efficient GPU-based algorithm. The resulting instances of the conflict resolution problem are provided to the community as a public benchmark. To efficiently solve this problem, we also introduce a generic framework for the cooperation of optimization algorithms. The framework benefits from the various optimization algorithms plugged to it by sharing relevant information among them, and is implemented as a distributed application for better performance. We illustrate its behavior on the conflict resolution problem with the cooperation between a Memetic Algorithm and an Integer Linear Program which consistently outperforms previous approaches by orders of magnitude. Instances with up to 60 aircraft are optimally solved within a few minutes using this framework, while each algorithm taken individually only provides sub-optimal solutions. This cooperative approach thus seems appropriate for application in a real-time context.}

Although a crucial part of the aircraft performance model, the aerodynamic property of aircraft is rarely available for public research purposes, as it is protected by aircraft manufacturers for commercial reasons. In many studies, a simplified quadratic drag polar model is assumed to compute the drag of an aircraft based on the required lift. In this paper, using surveillance data, we take on the challenge of estimating the drag polar coefficients based on a novel stochastic total energy model that employs Bayesian computing. The method is based on a stochastic hierarchical modeling approach, which is made possible given accurate open aircraft surveillance data and additional analytical models from the literature. Using this proposed method, the drag polar models for 20 of the most common aircraft types are estimated and summarized. By combining additional data from the literature, we propose additional methods allowing aircraft total drag to be calculated under other configurations, such as when flaps and landing gears are deployed. We also include additional models allowing the calculation of wave drag caused by compressibility at high Mach number. Though uncertainties exist, it has been found that the estimated drag polars agree with existing models, as well as CFD simulation results. The trajectory data, performance models, and results related to this study are shared publicly.}

abstract = {With the advent of seemingly unstructured big data, and through seamless integration of computation and physical components, cyber-physical systems (CPS) provide an innovative way to enhance safety and resiliency of transport infrastructure. This study focuses on real-world microscopic driving behavior and its relevance to school zone safety – expanding the capability, usability, and safety of dynamic physical systems through data analytics. Driving behavior and school zone safety is a public health concern. The sequence of instantaneous driving decisions and its variations prior to involvement in safety critical events, defined as driving volatility, can be a leading indicator of safety. By harnessing unique naturalistic data on more than 41,000 normal, crash, and near-crash events featuring over 9.4 million temporal samples of real-world driving, a characterization of volatility in microscopic driving decisions is sought at school and non-school zone locations. A big data analytic methodology is proposed for quantifying driving volatility in microscopic real-world driving decisions. Eight different volatility measures are then linked with detailed event-specific characteristics, health history, driving history/experience, and other factors to examine crash propensity at school zones. A comprehensive yet fully flexible state-of-the-art generalized mixed logit framework is employed to fully account for distinct yet related methodological issues of scale and random heterogeneity, containing multinomial logit, random parameter logit, scaled logit, hierarchical scaled logit, and hierarchical generalized mixed logit as special cases. The results reveal that both for school and non-school locations, drivers exhibited greater intentional volatility prior to safety-critical events. Volatility in positive and negative vehicular jerk in longitudinal and lateral directions associates with increases the probability of unsafe outcomes (crashes or near-crashes) at school zones. A one-unit increase in intentional volatility measured by positive vehicular jerk in longitudinal direction associates with a 0.0528 increase in the probability of crash outcome. Importantly, the effect of negative vehicular jerk (braking) in longitudinal direction on the likelihood of crash outcome is almost double. Methodologically, Hierarchical Generalized Mixed Logit model resulted in best-fit, simultaneously accounting for scale and random heterogeneity. When accounted for separately, more parsimonious models accounting for scale heterogeneity performed comparably to the less parsimonious counterparts accounting for random heterogeneity. Importantly, even after accounting for random heterogeneity, substantial heterogeneity due to a “pure scale-effect” is still observed, underscoring the importance of scale effects in influencing the overall contours of variations in the modeled relationships. The study demonstrates the value of observational study design and big data analytics for understanding extreme driving behaviors in safe vs. unsafe driving outcomes. Implications for designing personalized school zone behavioral countermeasures are discussed.}

In early traffic forecasting studies, time-series models were adopted to accommodate autocorrelations between traffic states. The incorporation of spatial correlations into the forecasting of traffic states, however, involved a computational burden. Deep learning technologies were recently introduced to traffic forecasting in order to accommodate the spatio-temporal dependencies among traffic states. In the present study, we devised a novel graph-based neural network that expanded the existing graph convolutional neural network (GCN). The proposed model allowed us to differentiate the intensity of connecting to neighbor roads, unlike existing GCNs that give equal weight to each neighbor road. A plausible model architecture that mimicked real traffic propagation was established based on the graph convolution. The domain knowledge was efficiently incorporated into a neural network architecture. The present study also employed a generative adversarial framework to ensure that a forecasted traffic state could be as realistic as possible considering the joint probabilistic density of real traffic states. The forecasting performance of the proposed model surpassed that of the original GCN model, and the estimated adjacency matrices revealed the hidden nature of real traffic propagation.}

This study proposes a centralized control strategy that converts the pavement-related challenges of truck platooning into opportunities. This strategy leverages the auto-pilot technologies in CATs by optimizing the lateral position of each platoon or group of platoons. The efficiency of the proposed control strategy was demonstrated in a case study. Results showed that pavement life-cycle costs could be reduced up to 50\% by controlling the lateral position of the platoons for each day.}

These problems include (i) the effects of lateral friction often observed in HOV lanes and diverge bottlenecks, (ii) the relaxation phenomenon at merge bottlenecks, (iii) the occurrence of accidents due to lane changing, and (iv) traffic models for autonomous vehicles (AVs). We conjecture that traditional car-following models, where the lateral dimension is discretized into lanes, struggle with these problems and one has to resort to ad-hoc rules conceived to directly achieve the desired effect, and that are difficult to validate. We argue that the distance maintained by drivers in order to avoid collisions in all directions plays a fundamental role in all these problems. To test this hypothesis, we propose a simple two-dimensional microscopic car-following model based on the social force paradigm, and build simulation experiments that reproduce these phenomena. These phenomena are reproduced as an indirect consequence of the model’s formulation, as opposed to ad-hoc rules, thus shedding light on their causes. A better understanding of the behavior of human drivers in the lateral dimension can be translated to improving autonomous driving algorithms so that they are human-friendly. In addition, since AV technology is proprietary, we argue that the proposed model should provide a good starting point for building AV traffic flow models when real data becomes available, as these data come from sensors that cover two-dimensional regions.}

abstract = {With growing consumer demand and expectations, companies are attempting to achieve cost-efficient and faster delivery operations. The integration of autonomous vehicles, such as drones, in the last-mile network design can curtail many operational challenges and provide a competitive advantage. This paper deals with the problem of delivering orders to a set of customer locations using multiple drones that operate in conjunction with a single truck. To take advantage of the drone fleet, the delivery tasks are parallelized by concurrently dispatching the drones from a truck parked at a focal point (ideal drone launch location) to the nearby customer locations. Hence, the key decisions to be optimized are the partitioning of delivery locations into small clusters, identifying a focal point per cluster, and routing the truck through all focal points such that the customer orders in each cluster are fulfilled either by a drone or truck. In contrast to prior studies that tackle this problem using multi-phase sequential procedures, this paper presents mathematical programming models to jointly optimize all the decisions involved. We also consider two polices for choosing a cluster focal point - (i) restricting it to one of the customer locations, and (ii) allowing it to be anywhere in the delivery area (i.e., a customer or non-customer location). Since the models considering unrestricted focal points are computationally expensive, an unsupervised machine learning-based heuristic algorithm is proposed to accelerate the solution time. Initially, we treat the problem as a single objective by independently minimizing either the total cost or delivery completion time. Subsequently, the two conflicting objectives are considered together for obtaining the set of best trade-off solutions. An extensive computational study is conducted to investigate the impacts of restricting the focal points, and the influence of adopting a joint optimization method instead of a sequential approach. Finally, several key insights are obtained to aid the logistics practitioners in decision making.}

Two SRDT choice models are proposed to incorporate imperfect travel information: One based on multinomial Logit (MNL) model and the other on sequential, mixed multinomial/nested Logit model. These two variants, serving as base models, are further extended with two features: bounded rationality (BR) and information sharing. BR is considered by incorporating the indifference band into the random utility component of the MNL model, forming a BR-based DTD stochastic model. A macroscopic model of travel information sharing is integrated into the DTD dynamics to account for the impact of incomplete information on travelers’ SRDT choices. These DTD choice models are combined with within-day dynamics following the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) fluid dynamic network loading model. Simulations on large-scale networks (Anaheim) illustrate the interactions between users’ adaptive decision making and network conditions (including local disruption) with different levels of information availability and user behavior. Our findings highlight the need for modeling network transient and disequilibriated states, which are often overlooked in equilibrium-constrained network design and optimization.

Participants selectively received information allowing them to know the nature of each exit. The conditions under which nobody/everybody knew a priori the configuration of the room were tested alongside the condition where only wheelchair users had access to this information. The results show that evacuation time was greatly reduced when the three wheelchair users (out of 52 participants) were informed of exit location and nature. A further but more limited improvement was seen when all participants received the same information. A more detailed analysis indicates that the smooth motion of wheelchair users has benefits in relation to the surrounding crowd dynamics, highlighting the importance of improving accessibility for disabled people and making available to them information on exit route characteristics. The same results were obtained using the simulation model developed to account for the presence of wheelchair users and employed to investigate more detailed scenarios. More generally, this study suggests that information provision to specific groups of pedestrians could be more efficient and achieve similar results in comparison with trying to reach the largest possible number of pedestrians. The results and the methods presented in this study are particularly relevant to the development of automatic information systems, which are becoming the backbone of large pedestrian facilities.}

Specifically, we transplanted context and literal meaning of compound words into mobility and location attributes of stations. Using smart card data, we trained stacked autoencoders (SAE) with designed flow matrices as an embedding method to learn the mobility attributes. Subsequently, to discover the location attributes, we have applied affinity propagation clustering to classify 9 point of interest (POI) categories. Combined with urban planning knowledge, we manage to comprehend the land use meanings of 9 POI clusters. The location semantics is chosen from those categories reflecting its urban land use pattern. By choose meaningful combination of mobility and location semantics for stations’ similarity case studies, we summarized potential applications of this semantic framework.}

This study examines the battery-electric transit vehicle scheduling problem (BET-VSP) with stationary battery chargers installed at transit terminal stations. Two equivalent versions of mathematical formulations of the problem are provided. The first formulation is based on the deficit function theory, and the second formulation is an equivalent bi-objective integer programming model. The first objective of the math-programming optimization is to minimize the total number of EVs required, while the second objective is to minimize the total number of battery chargers required. To solve this bi-objective BET-VSP, two solution methods are developed. First, a lexicographic method-based two-stage construction-and-optimization solution procedure is proposed. Second, an adjusted max-flow solution method is developed. Three numerical examples are used as an expository device to illustrate the solution methods, together with a real-life case study in Singapore. The results demonstrate that the proposed math-programming models and solution methods are effective and have the potential to be applied in solving large-scale real-world BET-VSPs.}

Since each driver/rider may have several potential matches, to achieve a high performance level, the ridesharing operator needs to make the matching decisions based on a global view of the system that includes all active riders and drivers. Consequently, the ride-matching problem that needs to be solved can become computationally expensive, especially when the system is operating over a large region, or when it faces high demand levels during certain hours of the day. This paper develops a graph partitioning methodology based on the bipartite graph that arises in the one-to-one ride-matching problem. The proposed method decomposes the original graph into multiple sub-graphs with the goal of reducing the overall computational complexity of the problem as well as providing high quality solutions. We further show that this methodology can be extended to more complex ride-matching problems in a dynamic ride-sharing system. Using numerical experiments, we showcase the advantages of the new partitioning method for different forms of ride-matching problems.

Given a set of demand management and supply regulation strategies, whether the vehicular traffic on a network would approach or not to a steady state under certain assumptions of behavioral realism is of importance and great interest in practice. Moreover, one primary reason for understanding the long-term traffic evolution dynamics is to control or influence the system trajectory in an efficient manner. To address these problems, we focus on a dynamic feedback control design and its subsequent steady-state analysis for a class of day-to-day (DTD) disequilibrium process so that the network traffic would evolve towards the desired stable traffic equilibrium. We propose an interconnected dynamic system framework for the stability and convergence analysis of DTD traffic adjustment process under the dynamic feedback control. Distinguished from the existing studies, we introduce a notion of output stability as well as the Lyapunov-like conditions to carry out the investigation noting that the steady states of the dynamic tolls that correspond to the Lagrange multipliers of the traffic equilibrium problem can be non-unique. The proposed method gives rise to a new approach to selecting pricing strategy. The proposed method involves only two adjustment parameters with well-identified physical meanings while the requirement on adjustment parameters for convergence and stability is mild. Finally, several numerical examples are presented to illustrate the insightful findings. It is found that, with dynamic feedback control, the network traffic state can converge to the desired equilibrium in a much faster manner than the case without control. The dynamic feedback controller can be implemented as demand management and supply regulation strategies such as road pricing and signal control.}

By using a space-time network framework, all the involved transportation activities are well characterized in an extended space-time network, in which the train space-time travel arcs, passenger travel arcs, transfer arcs, etc., are all taken into account. Two performance measures are proposed to evaluate the network-based timetable of the last trains. Through considering the route choice behaviors, the problem of interest is formulated as 0–1 linear programming models from the perspective of a space-time network design. To effectively solve the proposed models, we dualize the hard constraints into the objective function to produce the relaxed models by introducing a set of Lagrangian multipliers. Then, the sub-gradient algorithm is proposed to iteratively minimize the gap of the lower and upper bounds of the primal models. Finally, two sets of numerical experiments are implemented in an illustrative network and the Beijing metro network, respectively, and experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and performance of the proposed methods.}

To obtain an effective BN structure, we first analyze the dependencies of the involved factors on each station and among adjacent stations, given domain knowledge and expertise about operational characteristics. We then put forward four candidate BN structures, integrating expert knowledge, the interdependencies learned from real-world data, and real-time prediction and operational requirements. Next, we train the candidate structures based on a 5-fold cross-validation method, using the operational data from Wuhan-Guangzhou (W-G) and Xiamen-Shenzhen (X-S) high-speed railway (HSR) lines in China. The best performing structure is nominated to predict the consequences of disruptions and disturbances in the two HSR lines. Comparisons results show that the proposed model outperforms three other commonly used predictive models, reaching an average prediction accuracy of 96.6\%, 74.8\%, and 91.0\% on the W-G HSR line, and 94.8\%, 91.1\%, and 87.9\% on the X-S HSR line for variables L, N, and T, respectively.}

This paper proposes an ensemble learning framework to predict the customer booking behaviour and demand using the observed data of a suburban On-Demand Transport service where data scarcity is a challenge.

Although there is considerable research into the effects of information and communication technologies (ICT) on activity-travel choices, there is little understanding of the inter-relationships between online and in-person activity participation and the extent to which the two worlds complement one another or substitute for one another. Shopping is one of the activity realms in which the virtual and physical spaces are increasingly interacting. This paper aims to unravel the relationships between online and in-person activity engagement in the shopping domain, while explicitly distinguishing between shopping for non-grocery goods, grocery products, and ready-to-eat meals. Data from the 2017 Puget Sound household travel survey is used to estimate a multivariate ordered probit model of the number of days in a week that a sample of households engages in in-person activity engagement and online activity engagement for each of these shopping activity types – leading to a model of six endogenous outcomes. Model results show that there are intricate complementary and substitution effects between in-person and online shopping activities, that these activities are considered as a single packaged bundle, and that the frequencies of these activities are significantly affected by income, built environment attributes, and household structure. The findings suggest that travel forecasting models should incorporate model components that capture the interplay between in-person and online shopping engagement and explicitly distinguish between non-grocery and grocery shopping activities. Policies that help bridge the digital divide so that households of all socio-economic strata can access goods and services in the virtual world would help improve quality of life for all. Finally, the paper highlights the need to bring passenger and freight demand modeling, at least within urban contexts, into a single integrated structure.}

Traditionally, quay cranes can handle one container at a time. However, this is expected to change with the recently patented next-generation quay crane: The Ship to Shore Multi-trolley Portal Gantry Container Crane. These next-generation cranes can access two bays simultaneously and can operate on four containers at a time. In this work, we introduce a mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation and an exact solution approach to solve the next-generation quay crane scheduling problem. The solution technique breaks the main problem into two sequential stages. The first stage uses a fast set-partitioning formulation to solve the general case and a closed form analytic approach to solve specific cases, while the second stage uses a partitioning heuristic combined with a branch-and-price algorithm. A real-workload case study and simulated-workload case studies are used to assess the performance of the next-generation cranes versus traditional ones. Results show that the use of two to three next-generation cranes can generally reduce the service time beyond the best possible service time achieved by traditional cranes. Moreover, average service times can be reduced by up to 65\%. Finally, results of a computational study and sensitivity analyses show that the proposed solution approach has low sensitivity to the different parameters and clearly outperforms CPLEX in that it can solve real-sized cases rapidly; in the computational study all cases were solved in less than 20 s.}

Since spatial price differentiation raises the issue of privacy infringement, two hybrid pricing schemes are proposed to internalize travelers’ privacy cost. Under these schemes, a traveler is given the options to maintain her anonymity and pay a “regular” toll, or compromise her privacy and receive a discount. One of the hybrid schemes allows the traveler’s privacy cost to be dependent on the link composition of the traveler’s path. In other words, she can choose to disclose none, part, or all of her path information. We prove that the minimum toll burden—with or without the privacy cost—required to decentralize a system optimum gradually decreases as the toll becomes more spatially differentiated. We also show that the new hybrid scheme demonstrates some interesting analytical properties compared to existing schemes.}

abstract = {GPS based campaigns have been hailed as an alternative to transportation surveys that promise relatively high accuracy at a relatively low burden on the participants and fewer forgotten trips. However they still necessitate the recruitment of participants and are thus potentially biased and certainly not encompassing significant parts of the population. Given the high penetration of mobile phones, passive tracking by telephone providers would alleviate those two shortcomings at the cost of reduced sampling frequency and positional accuracy. The trade-off in quality has not yet been quantified and therefore recommendations on sensible thresholds are not yet available. In this study therefore, instead of presenting yet another method for mode of transport classification, we therefore compare the performance of existing mode detection schemes under deteriorating sampling rates and positional accuracies. As a possibility to compensate for the deteriorating signal we also calculate features from users’ positional histories that could be beneficial if their behaviour is repetitive. The evaluation is not only based on pointwise accuracy, but includes quality measures that pertain to trips as a whole. We find that the necessary accuracy and sampling rate for applications will depend on whether the information of whole trajectories can be used, or whether only the current information is available. The former being relevant to ex-post analyses while the latter situation appears more frequently in near-time analyses. For segmentwise classification, there is no major impact on the quality of the classification by the tested levels of spatial accuracies as long as the sampling intervals can be kept at or below a minute, whereas for point based classification the sampling interval should be between 30 s and a minute and increasing spatial accuracy always improves the classification.}

Accordingly, we study the integrated rail-mounted yard crane and AGV scheduling problem as a multi-robot coordination and scheduling problem in this paper. Based on a discretized virtualized network, we propose a multi-commodity network flow model with two sets of flow balance constraints for cranes and AGVs. In addition, two side constraints are introduced to deal with inter-robot constraints to reflect the complex interactions among terminal agents accurately. The Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) method is adopted in this study as a market-driven approach to dualize the hard side constraints; therefore, the original problem is decomposed into a set of crane-specific and vehicle-specific subtasks. The cost-effective solutions can be obtained by iteratively adjusting both the primal and dual costs of each subtask. We also compare the computational performance of the proposed solution framework with that of the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) model using commercial solvers. Comparison results indicate that our proposed approach could efficiently find solutions within 2\% optimality gaps. Illustrative and real-world instances show that the proposed approach effectively serves the accurate coordination of AGVs and cranes in automated terminals.}

To bridge this gap, we designed and conducted a set of field experiments to reveal differences in car-following behaviors between a human driver following-AV and following-HV on both constant speed traffic characteristics with discrete speeds ({10,20,…,60}km/h) and dynamic car-following behaviors with continuous speeds (within 0–60 km/h) in both the indifferentiable and differentiable appearance settings of the AV. We recruited 10 drivers for the experiment (14 runs for each driver and collected position and speed data of the tested vehicles along their complete trajectories based on vehicle gaps, headways, and standard deviations of vehicle speed. A K-means clustering algorithm was applied to classify drivers based on their responses in following-AV vs. following-HV with both constant speed and dynamic speed characteristics. The analyses of the differentiable appearance setting show that different drivers exhibit different behaviors in following-AV vs. following-HV: some are AV-believers, some are AV-skeptics, and the others are insensitive. Yet in the indifferentiable appearance setting, there is no significant difference between following a lead AV and following a lead HV. This reveals that drivers’ response to the lead vehicle depends on their subjective trusts on AV technologies rather than the actual driving behavior. The results suggest that, depending on the characteristics and composition of the drivers, classic car-following behavior in pure HV traffic may need to be updated for modeling mixed traffic in the near future.}

Airspace reconfiguration involves, on the other side, adjusting the opening schemes of predefined configurations, or creating new ones (if needed) through dynamic sectorisation. Results suggest that, using the proposed approach, the required system delay can be reduced remarkably, whereas the number of opened sectors (and thus operating cost) and the total capacity provision (supplied by the Air Navigation Service Providers) decrease at the same time, due to the increased capacity utilisation per operating sector.}

abstract = {Automated monitoring of pedestrians on non-motorized facilities with high pedestrian flows is challenging. Several automated sensor solutions are commercially available that have been evaluated in the literature including traditional point-based sensors, such as inductive loop detectors for bicycles and infrared sensors for pedestrians. More recently, image-based systems, based on video cameras or thermal video cameras, have been developed. Despite the various options, some key limitations of existing solutions exist, in particular, the lack of low-cost solutions using embedded systems capable of performing in real-time under high volume (flow) conditions. This work aims at developing and evaluating the performance of a novel, real-time counting system, developed for environments with high pedestrian flows. The proposed system is based on emerging LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology. As an input, the system uses the distance measurements from a two-dimensional LiDAR sensor with a set of distinct laser channels and a given angular resolution between each channel. The developed system processes those measurements using a clustering algorithm to detect, count, and identify the direction of travel of each pedestrian. The system’s performance is evaluated by comparing its directional counting outputs with manual counts (ground truth) using disaggregate and aggregate (15-minutes interval) counts at two different monitoring locations. The results demonstrate that the system accurately counts more than 97\% of the pedestrians at the disaggregate level, with a false direction detection rate of 1.1\%. The over-counting error is 0.7\% and the under-counting errors are 1.3\% and 2.7\% for the two selected sites. At the aggregate level (15-minutes interval), the average absolute percentage deviations (AAPDs) are 1.6\% and 4.3\% while the weighted AAPDs are 1.5\% and 3.5\% for the first and second sites, respectively. The accuracy of the proposed system is higher than the traditional technologies used for the same purpose.}

Through Basic Safety Message (BSM) data from the Michigan Safety Pilot Program, this study applies a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to understand driving behavior in terms of acceleration, deceleration and maintaining speed decisions. Personally Revealed Choices (PRC) that maximize the expected sum of rewards for individual drivers are obtained by analyzing detailed data from 120 trips and the application of MDP. Specifically, this paper defines states based on the number of objects around the host vehicle and the distance to the front object. Given the states, individual drivers’ reward functions are estimated using the multinomial logit model and used in the MDP framework. Optimal policies (i.e. PRC) are obtained through a value iteration algorithm. The results show that as the number of objects increases around a host vehicle, the driver prefer to accelerate in order to escape the crowdedness around them. In addition, when trips are segmented based on the level of crowdedness, increased levels of trip crowdedness results in a fewer number of drivers accelerating because the traffic conditions constrain them to maintaining constant speed or deceleration. One potential application of this study is to generate short-term predictive driver decision information through historical driving performance, which can be used to warn a host vehicle driver when the person substantially deviates from their own historical PRC. This information could also be disseminated to surrounding vehicles as well, enabling them to foresee the states and actions of other drivers and potentially avoid collisions.}

The control strategy comprises three distinct actions: (i) gradual decrease of ACC time-gaps at near-capacity traffic in order to increase capacity; (ii) minimum time-gaps and (iii) acceleration increase, both at the very vicinity of active bottlenecks in order to increase the discharge flow. The behaviour and impact of the control strategy, and of each of its parts separately, are demonstrated for different ACC penetration rates via microscopic simulation applied to a real motorway stretch. The simulation results show that, even for low penetration rates of ACC-vehicles, the proposed strategy leads to sensible improvements regarding the average vehicle delay and fuel consumption by delaying the onset of congestion (thanks to increased capacity); and by speeding up its dissolution (thanks to the mitigation of capacity drop).}

For building an efficient Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and shared-control systems, the vehicle needs to understand the drivers’ intent and their activities to generate assistant and collaborative control strategies. In this study, a driver intention inference system that focuses on the highway lane change maneuvers is proposed. First, a high-level driver intention mechanism and framework are introduced. Then, a vision-based intention inference system is proposed, which captures the multi-modal signals based on multiple low-cost cameras and the VBOX vehicle data acquisition system. A novel ensemble bi-directional recurrent neural network (RNN) model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units is proposed to deal with the time-series driving sequence and the temporal behavioral patterns. Naturalistic highway driving data that consists of lane-keeping, left and right lane change maneuvers are collected and used for model construction and evaluation. Furthermore, the driver's pre-maneuver activities are statistically analyzed. It is found that for situation-aware, drivers usually check the mirrors for more than six seconds before they initiate the lane change maneuver, and the time interval between steering the handwheel and crossing the lane is about 2 s on average. Finally, hypothesis testing is conducted to show the significant improvement of the proposed algorithm over existing ones. With five-fold cross-validation, the EBiLSTM model achieves an average accuracy of 96.1\% for the intention that is inferred 0.5 s before the maneuver starts.}

abstract = {In this paper a new multi-class urban traffic model is proposed based on the features of a single-class urban traffic model and the characteristics of a multi-class freeway traffic model. The heterogeneous traffic flow is represented using the concept of Passenger Car Equivalent (PCE) for congestion and free-flow regimes separately. The proposed multi-class urban traffic model is intended for model-based control applications. The single-class model and the proposed multi-class traffic model are compared with microscopic simulation data obtained using the SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) open-source simulator. The two models are calibrated through optimal parameter estimation and their performance is evaluated and compared by taking into account the error index between the models and the simulation data. Simulation results show that the multi-class model gives a significantly better fit.}

abstract = {The technological barriers to automated driving systems (ADS) are being quickly overcome to deploy on–road vehicles that do not require a human driver on–board. ADS have opened up possibilities to improve mobility, productivity, logistics planning, and energy consumption. However, further enhancements in productivity and energy consumption are required to reach CO2–reduction goals, owing to increased demands on transportation. In particular, in the freight sector, incorporation of automation with electrification can meet necessities of sustainable transport. However, the profitability of battery electric heavy vehicles (BEHVs) remains a concern. This study found that ADS led to profitability of BEHVs, which remained profitable for increased travel ranges by a factor of four compared to that of BEHVs driven by humans. Up to 20\% reduction in the total cost of ownership of BEHVs equipped with ADS could be achieved by optimizing the electric propulsion system along with the infrastructure for a given transportation task. In that case, the optimized propulsion system might not be similar to that of a BEHV with a human driver. To obtain the results, the total cost of ownership was minimized numerically for 3072 different transportation scenarios that showed the effects of travel distance, road hilliness, average reference speed, and vehicle size on the incorporated electrification and automation, and compared to that of conventional combustion–powered heavy vehicles.}

abstract = {Most perimeter control methods in literature are the model-based schemes designing the controller based on the available accurate macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) function with well known techniques of modern control methods. However, accurate modeling of the traffic flow system is hard and time-consuming. On the other hand, macroscopic traffic flow patterns show heavily similarity between days, and data from past days might enable improving the performance of the perimeter controller. Motivated by this observation, a model free adaptive iterative learning perimeter control (MFAILPC) scheme is proposed in this paper. The three features of this method are: (1) No dynamical model is required in the controller design by virtue of dynamic linearization data modeling technique, i.e., it is a data-driven method, (2) the perimeter controller performance will improve iteratively with the help of the repetitive operation pattern of the traffic system, (3) the learning gain is tuned adaptively along the iterative axis. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is tested comparing with various control methods for a multi-region traffic network considering modeling errors, measurement noise, demand variations, and time-changing MFDs. Simulation results show that the proposed MFAILPC presents a great potential and is more resilient against errors than the standard perimeter control methods such as model predictive control, proportional-integral control, etc.}

This paradigm shift demands on new infrastructure that serves and boosts local cycling rates. This creates the need for novel data sources, tools, and methods that allow us to identify and prioritize locations where to intervene via properly planned cycling infrastructure. Here, we define potential demand as the total trips of the population that could be supported by bicycle paths. To that end, we use information from a phone-based travel demand and the trip distance distribution from bike apps. Next, we use percolation theory to prioritize paths with high potential demand that benefit overall connectivity if a bike path would be added. We use Bogotá as a case study to demonstrate our methods. The result is a data science framework that informs interventions and improvements to an urban cycling infrastructure.}

Trajectory data is large-scale, high-dimensional, and sparse in nature and, thus, requires an efficient privacy-preserving data publishing (PPDP) algorithm with high data utility. This paper describes the investigation of the publication of non-interactive sanitized trajectory data under a Differential Privacy (DP) definition. To this end, a new prefix tree structure, an incremental privacy budget allocation model, and a spatial-temporal dimensionality reduction model are proposed to enhance the sanitized data utility as well as to improve runtime efficiency. The developed algorithm is implemented and applied to real-life metro smart card data from Shenzhen, China, which includes a total of 2.8 million individual travelers and over 220 million records. Numerical analysis finds that, compared with previous work, the proposed model outputs sanitized dataset with higher utilities, and the algorithm is more efficient and scalable.}

abstract = {Lanes used by taxis and other shared-ride vehicles at airports and rail terminals are often congested. The present paper examines congestion-mitigating strategies for a special type of lane inside of which taxis are prohibited from overtaking each other while dropping-off patrons. Taxis must therefore often wait in first-in-first-out (FIFO) queues that form in the lane during busy periods. Patrons may be discharged from taxis upon reaching a desired area near the terminal entrance. When wait times grow long, however, some taxis discharge their patrons in advance of that desired area. The Nanjing South Railway Station in China is selected as a case study. Its FIFO drop-off lane is presently managed by police officers who allow taxis to enter the lane in batched fashion. Inefficiencies are observed because curb space near the upstream and downstream ends of the lane often goes unused. A microscopic simulation model is developed in-house, and is painstakingly calibrated to data measured in the study site’s FIFO lane. Simulation experiments indicate that rescinding the lane’s present batching strategy can increase taxi outflow by more than 25\%. Further experiments show that even greater gains can be achieved by requiring taxis to discharge patrons when forced by downstream queues to stop a prescribed distance in advance of a desired drop-off area. Further gains were predicted by requiring the lead taxi in each batch to discharge its patron(s) only after travelling a prescribed distance beyond a desired location. The above findings are confirmed for scenarios calibrated with field data collected on two different days, and for hypothetical scenarios with varying input parameters. Roles that technology can play in implementing these new lane-management strategies are discussed. So are their practical implications in light of the present boom in shared-ride services.}

The key point to make full use of ACC advantages and make up human’s weakness on supervising task is the reasonable arrangement of control time of ACC and human driver. In this paper, an MPC (Model Predictive Control) based optimized switching strategy of longitudinal driving authority transition is proposed, which aims to provide proper advice for human drivers to handover and takeover control authority, through minimizing the overall index consisted of the operation workload, fuel consumption, takeover risk and tracking errors. In addition, a new driver longitudinal model considering actual reaction time delay and insensitive distance perception of human drivers is proposed as well, which combines with ACC to constitute a typical switched control system called the switched driving model as the predictive model for MPC. The stable condition of the new driver longitudinal model is derived by using describing function method and a sufficient condition to ensure steady switched system is given by using the Lyapunov method and LMI approach. The results of simulator experiments show that the new driver model describes the car-following behavior of real human driver better. What’s more, the simulation results demonstrate that the performance index of switched driving is smaller than the human driving and ACC driving only, and the optimization time is short enough to meet the requirement of engineering practice.}

Such systems could potentially address some of the inherent shortcomings of a line/schedule based public transport system. Previous studies either assumed that flexible on-demand services are used as an exclusive door-to-door service or offered as a feeder connection to high-capacity public transport services. However, users may combine line/schedule based public transport systems (Fixed PT) and on-demand services (Flexible PT) so that their travel impedance is minimized. To this end, we propose a multimodal route choice and assignment model that allows users combining Fixed and Flexible PT or use them as individual modes while demand for these services is endogenously determined. The model takes into account the dynamic demand–supply interaction using an iterative learning framework. Flexible public transport can be used to perform any part of the trip, ranging from a first/last mile service to an exclusive direct door-to-door connection. The developed model is implemented in an agent based simulation framework. The model is applied to a network centered around the city of Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Scenarios where Fixed PT and Flexible PT are offered as mutually exclusive modes or can be combined into a single journey, are analysed. Results indicate that Flexible PT is predominantly used for covering <30\% of the trip length, indicating that it is mainly used as an access or egress mode to Fixed PT. This results with an overall increase in the share of public transport trips. Also, the average waiting time of Flexible PT users when used in combination with Fixed PT are lower than the scenario where each of them is used as an exclusive mode.}

Thus far, the majority of the CACC studies have been focusing on the overall network performance with limited insights on the potential impacts of CAVs on human-driven vehicles (HVs). This paper aims to quantify such impacts by studying the high-resolution vehicle trajectory data that are obtained from microscopic simulation. Two platoon clustering strategies for CACC- an ad hoc coordination strategy and a local coordination strategy-are implemented. Results show that the local coordination outperforms the ad hoc coordination across all tested market penetration rates (MPRs) in terms of network throughput and productivity. According to the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, however, the distributions of the hard braking events (as a potential safety impact) for HVs change significantly under local coordination strategy. For both of the clustering strategy, CAVs increase the average lane change frequency for HVs. The break-even point for average lane change frequency between the two strategies is observed at 30\% MPR, which decreases from 5.42 to 5.38 per vehicle. The average lane change frequency following a monotonically increasing pattern in response to MPR, and it reaches the highest 5.48 per vehicle at 40\% MPR. Lastly, the interaction state of the car-following model for HVs is analyzed. It is revealed that the composition of the interaction state could be influenced by CAVs as well. One of the apparent trends is that the time spent on approaching state declines with the increasing presence of CAVs.}

This paper proposes an integrated optimization with tactical cross-line planning and an operational express train mode to fully utilize line capacities and reduce the total trip time without additional operating costs and investments. In this paper, a new mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model is proposed for systemically exploring the benefits of cross-line express trains to achieve both passenger travel time and operation cost savings; in this model, the frequencies, stopping patterns and operation zones of cross-line express trains and local trains are simultaneously optimized. The characteristics of same-line trips (SLT) and cross-line trips (CLT) under various stopping patterns are investigated. Additionally, a genetic algorithm (GA) is developed based on the MINLP model. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model and heuristic algorithm is verified through a set of real-life instances based on the Beijing URT network. The results show that the number of transfers can be reduced by 78\%, with a 3.34\% savings of travel time and a 4.66\% savings of operating costs, when the cross-line express operating mode is properly adjusted.}

abstract = {At present, en-route flight traffic is carried out on a system of predefined routes with a low number of intersections between aircraft trajectories. This enables the air traffic controllers to control and supervise the traffic, especially around these intersections. Consequently, the route system leads to a low ratio of used to unused airspace, where not necessarily the shortest route is used for each flight. To reduce trajectory length, the idea of free routing has been developed, whereby each aircraft uses the direct connection between origin and destination airport, generating a traffic distribution which uses nearly the entire available airspace. As a consequence, many intersections between flight trajectories occur, making it more difficult for controllers to handle. We use these intersections as the basis of a so-called main-flow system with trajectories consisting of intersection points instead of waypoints. The intersections of all trajectories of a traffic sample are clustered and the resulting cluster centres are used as nodes in a route system. Additional processing is applied to identify a system of main flows and reduce the number of intersections to an acceptable amount. Our approach is able to identify major traffic flows within unstructured great-circle traffic and to create a main-flow system which is a compromise between the flexibility of free routing and the easier surveillance by controllers in the case of a predefined route network. To prove the ability of the proposed method to identify main flows, it was applied to a scenario of planned flights following the standard route structure. Subsequent tests with two different free-routing scenarios led to new route systems where the median adapted trajectory length for flights of the traffic sample is merely 0.9\% (respectively 4.1\%) higher than the direct connections. Furthermore, structural complexity is lower for intersections (cluster centres) of the new main-flow system compared to those of direct or great-circle scenarios.}

Although current research works model and simulate transportation resilience from different perspectives, the real-world resilience of urban road network is still unclear. In this paper, a novel end to end deep learning framework is proposed to estimate and predict the spatiotemporal patterns of transportation resilience under extreme weather events. Diffusion Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network and a dynamic-capturing algorithm of transportation resilience jointly form the backbone of this framework. The presented framework can capture the spatiotemporal dependencies of urban road network and evaluate transportation resilience based on real-world big data, including on-demand ride services data provided by DiDi Chuxing and grid meteorological data. Results show that aggregate data of related precipitation events could be used for transportation resilience modeling under extreme weather events when facing sample imbalance problem due to limited historical disaster data. In terms of observed transportation resilience, transportation network demonstrates different characteristics between sparse network and dense network, as well as general precipitation events and extreme weather events. The response time is double or triple of the recovery time, and an elastic limit exists in the recovery process of network resilience. In terms of resilience prediction, the proposed model outperforms competitors by incorporating topological information and has better predictions of the system performance degradation than other resilience indices. The above results could assist researchers and policy makers clearly understand the real-world resilience of urban road networks in both theory and practice, and take effective responses under emergent disruptive events.}

However, the market share of their pooled version (ridesharing, e.g., UberPOOL or LyftLine) is still low, despite its potential in addressing the mobility challenges that dense urban cities are facing. In this research, we analyse user preferences towards pooled on-demand services regarding their time-reliability-cost trade-offs. We study, via stated preference experiments, the value of time (VOT) and value of reliability (VOR) of the different trip stages (waiting stage, in-vehicle stage, and transfer stage when combined with line-based public transport). We target urban Dutch individuals (N = 1006), and address commuting and leisure trips. Results show in-vehicle VOT for pooled on-demand services to amount to 7.88–10.80 €/h. These values are somewhat higher than known values of traditional public transport. We also find waiting VOT (both before the trip and during the transfer stage) to be lower than values previously reported in literature. In general, we find VOR to be lower than VOT: the reliability ratio (VOR/VOT ratio) for both the waiting stage and the in-vehicle stage being around 0.5. In order to understand different preferences, we also estimate latent class choice models. The analysis shows that the main difference between classes pertains to the overall time-cost and reliability-cost trade-offs (VOT and VOR values) rather than in different valuations of the reliability ratio. In addition to serving as input for demand forecasting models such as macroscopic static assignment and agent-based simulation models, our findings can support service providers in developing their strategy when designing pooled on-demand services.}

Then the FD of mixed HV and CAV traffic is developed with CAV penetration and platooning intensity taken into consideration. A Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is applied to model the stochastic headway, based on which the stochastic FD is derived. Impact of CAV penetration and platooning intensity on the stochasticity of FD is studied. Results from theoretical analysis and case study show that increasing CAV penetration can reduce the scattering of FD, while higher platooning intensity may result in more scattering of FD.}

From their initial diffusion centres in North America and Europe, these on-demand mobility services are increasingly becoming available in developing countries. Yet, empirical research from these contexts on the impact of ride-hailing services is lacking. To address this gap, this paper examines the factors driving the adoption of ride-hailing and the associated travel characteristics and mode substitution effects in Ghana, Sub-Saharan Africa. Using data from a large sample survey (N = 1188) of commuters in a multi-variable structural equation model, the paper shows that socio-demographic factors, perceived benefits and ease of use of ride-hailing, perceived safety risks and car-dependent lifestyles influence adoption and use of ride-hailing services. Similar to other contexts, individuals’ reference ride-hailing trips were mainly for ‘special occasion’ purposes (51\%), but work and school journeys were also high (41\%). Shorter travel times (≤30 min) and single passenger journeys within inner-suburban and outer-suburban localities typify ride-hailing trips. This contrasts with other contexts where ride-hailing is used frequently by urban dwellers and less so by those in the suburbs. Ride-hailing use replaced conventional taxis (51\%), public transport (36\%), private car (10\%) and walking (1\%), suggesting mode substitution effects for individuals’ reference trips. Further exploration of a full day’s travel mode choices also revealed that individuals use other available modes of transport in addition to ride-hailing services. However, multi-modal integration is weak, suggesting that ride-hailing tends to be used alone for full door-to-door journeys, instead of complementing other existing modes in serving first/last mile access for example. The implications of the findings for sustainable mobility are discussed.}

abstract = {Modern traffic control and management systems in urban networks require real-time estimation of the traffic states. In this paper, a novel approach for modeling traffic flow in urban networks that is especially suitable for state estimation is proposed. The complexity of the urban traffic model is reduced by assuming availability of connected vehicle data. We first investigate the observability issue in urban traffic networks using a graphical approach. Then, the proposed model for the evolution of the traffic flow in urban traffic networks is developed and used in two layers, i.e., link layer and network layer, to estimate, in high-resolution (second-by-second), the traffic states in the whole network. Traffic states in the link layer include queue tail location and the number of vehicles in the queue, while in the network layer, estimation of the total number of vehicles per link and turning rates at the intersections is carried out. In a first step, it is shown that the estimation approach only requires the detectors at the borders of the network. We further demonstrate that in the proposed scheme, one may reduce or drop the need for spot detectors for the price of reduced, but still reasonable estimation accuracy. The validation of the approach has been undertaken by comparing the produced estimates with realistic micro-simulation results as ground truth, and the achieved simulation results are promising.}

abstract = {Autonomous Vehicles (AV) may become widely diffused as a road transport technology around the world. However, two conditions of successful adoption of AVs are that they must be synchronously shared, to avoid negative transport network and environmental consequences, and that high levels of public acceptance of the technology must exist. The implications of these two conditions are that travellers must accept sharing rides with unfamiliar others in Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAV). Two factors that have been identified as being positive influencers of acceptance are comfort and trust. The present paper undertakes a novel examination as to how comfort and trust ratings are affected by specific attributes of the ride experience of travelling in a fully-automated real-world, shared vehicle. To this end, 55 participants experienced riding in an SAV shuttle under experimental conditions at a test facility. Each experimental run involved two unrelated participants, accompanied by a safety operative and a researcher, undertaking four trips in the SAV, during which two conditions were presented for each of the independent variables of ‘direction of face’ (forwards/backwards) and ‘maximum vehicle speed’ (8/16 km/h). Order of presentation was varied between pairs of participants. After each run, participants rated the dependent variables ‘trust’ and ‘comfort’ (the latter variable comprised by six comfort factors). Expected and evaluative ratings were also obtained during pre-experimental orientation and debriefing sessions. Statistically significant relationships (p < .001) were found between trust and each of the independent variables, but for neither variable in the case of perceived comfort. A strong correlation was found between comfort and trust, interpreted as indicating trust in the SAV as an important predictor of perceived comfort. The before and after-experiment ratings for both variables showed statistically significant increases, and particularly for daily car drivers.}

However, the open-access environment makes the cooperating platoon CAVs vulnerable to cyberattacks, causing concerns on traffic safety and mobility. So far, due to the lack of analytical models integrating malicious effects of manipulated information into CAV dynamics, we have limited knowledge on CAV platoon performance under cyberattack. It necessities a modeling framework to support a comprehensive analysis of the CAV platoon performance in a capricious travel environment. This study seeks to bridge this critical gap from the following three aspects. First, we review potential safety-related cyberattacks faced by CAVs, related to manipulation of vehicle position, speed, and acceleration. Based on the review, these cyberattacks are categorized into three types: bogus messages, replay/delay, and collusion attack. Second, we develop a generalized vehicle dynamics model that accounts for the cyberattack effects on CAV dynamics. The proposed model, labeled cooperative intelligent driver model (CIDM), integrates the dynamic communication topological structure to enable the analysis of effects of manipulated information on CAV dynamics. The dynamic communication structure is a time-varying function which is determined by the communication range and the distance between two vehicles. Upon the proposed CIDM, the third aspect focuses on simulation analysis of CAV platoon safety and efficiency under cyberattacks, which demonstrate the cyberattack effects at the platoon level. This study contributes to the fundamental understanding of CAV platoon dynamics under cyberattacks and lays a foundation to enhance the cybersecurity of CAV systems.}

These modules are combined via residual connections to capture the spatial, temporal and extraneous dependencies of travel demand. The end-to-end trainable RSTN redefines the traditional prediction problem as a learning residual function with regard to the travel density in each time interval. Further more, a dynamic request vector (DRV)-based data representation scheme is presented, which catches the intrinsic characteristics and variation of the trend, to improve the performance of forecasting. Simulations with two real-word data sets show that the proposed method outperforms the existing forecasting algorithms, reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) by up to 17.87\%.}

Nowadays, there is a need for prominent solutions capable of mining information from messy and multidimensional road traffic data sets with few modeling constraints. In that sense, we propose a unique and versatile model to address different major challenges of traffic forecasting in an unsupervised manner. We formulate the road traffic forecasting problem as a latent variable model, assuming that traffic data is not generated randomly but from a latent space with fewer dimensions containing the underlying characteristics of traffic. We solve the problem by proposing a variational autoencoder (VAE) model to learn how traffic data are generated and inferred, while validating it against three different real-world traffic data sets. Under this framework, we propose an online unsupervised imputation method for unobserved traffic data with missing values. Additionally, taking advantage of the low dimension latent space learned, we compress the traffic data before applying a prediction model obtaining improvements in the forecasting accuracy. Finally, given that the model not only learns useful forecasting features but also meaningful characteristics, we explore the latent space as a tool for model and data selection and traffic anomaly detection from the point of view of traffic modelers.}

With the rise of artificial intelligence, many recent studies attempted to use deep neural networks to extract comprehensive features from traffic networks to enhance prediction performance, given the volume and variety of traffic data has been greatly increased. Considering that traffic status on a road segment is highly influenced by the upstream/downstream segments and nearby bottlenecks in the traffic network, extracting well-localized features from these neighboring segments is essential for a traffic prediction model. Although the convolution neural network or graph convolution neural network has been adopted to learn localized features from the complex geometric or topological structure of traffic networks, the lack of flexibility in the local-feature extraction process is still a big issue. Classical wavelet transform can detect sudden changes and peaks in temporal signals. Analogously, when extending to the graph/spectral domain, graph wavelet can concentrate more on key vertices in the graph and discriminatively extract localized features. In this study, to capture the complex spatial-temporal dependencies in network-wide traffic data, we learn the traffic network as a graph and propose a graph wavelet gated recurrent (GWGR) neural network. The graph wavelet is incorporated as a key component for extracting spatial features in the proposed model. A gated recurrent structure is employed to learn temporal dependencies in the sequence data. Comparing to baseline models, the proposed model can achieve state-of-the-art prediction performance and training efficiency on two real-world datasets. In addition, experiments show that the sparsity of graph wavelet weight matrices greatly increases the interpretability of GWGR.}

abstract = {Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are bringing challenges and opportunities to urban traffic systems. One of the crucial challenges for traffic managers and local authorities is to understand the nonlinear change in road capacity with increasing AV penetration rate, and to efficiently reallocate the Right-of-Way (RoW) for the mixed flow of AVs and Human Driven Vehicles (HDVs). Most of the existing research suggests that road capacity will significantly increase at high AV penetration rates or an all-AV scenario, when AVs are able to drive with smaller headways to the leading vehicle. However, this increase in road capacity might not be significant at a lower AV penetration rate due to the heterogeneity between AVs and HDVs. In order to investigate the impacts of mixed flow conditions (AVs and HDVs), this paper firstly proposes a theoretical model to demonstrate that road capacity can be increased with proper RoW reallocation. Secondly, four different RoW reallocation strategies are compared using a SUMO simulation to cross-validate the results in a numerical analysis. A range of scenarios with different AV penetration rates and traffic demands are used. The results show that road capacity on a two-lane road can be significantly improved with appropriate RoW reallocation strategies at low or medium AV penetration rates, compared with the do-nothing RoW strategy.}

The framework can be used to redistribute vehicles when the travel demand and taxi supply is either spatially or temporally imbalanced in a transportation network. While previous works mostly focus on using model-based methods, the goal of this paper is to explore the policy-based deep reinforcement learning algorithm as a model-free method to optimize the rebalancing strategy. In particular, we propose an actor-critic algorithm with feed-forward neural networks as approximations of both policy and value functions, where the policy function provides the optimal dispatch strategy and the value function estimates the expected costs at each time stamp. Our numerical studies show that the algorithm converges to the theoretical upper bound with less than 4\% optimality gap, whether the system dynamics are deterministic or stochastic. We also investigate the scenario where we consider user priority and fairness, and the results indicate that our learned policy is capable of producing a superior strategy that balances equity, cancellation, and level of service when user priority is considered.}

Energy storage and rapid battery recharge remain nonetheless challenging owing to the significant energy and power requirements of even small aircraft. By modifying algorithms developed in the field of scheduling theory, we propose power optimized and power-investment optimized strategies for electric aircraft battery swaps and recharges. Several aspects are considered: electric energy expenditures, capital expenditures, and flight schedule integrity. The first strategy optimizes the swaps and recharges to minimize the peak-power draw from the grid and reduce electric energy expenditures. The second strategy optimizes the swaps and recharges to minimize electricity expenditures and capital expenditures associated with battery and charger procurement. In both cases, the optimization is decomposed into two steps. The first step determines the combinations of numbers of chargers and batteries that yield a feasible recharge schedule. It is based on a network flow representation of the battery swap and recharge. The second step builds a recharge schedule for the previously determined numbers of chargers and batteries. Together, they enable the estimation of peak power demand, electric expenditures, and capital expenditures used to implement the power optimized and power-investment optimized strategies. Both strategies are applied to the operations of two commuter airlines and are contrasted with a benchmark non-optimized power-as-needed strategy. Promising results are obtained with up to 61\% reduction in peak-power draw and up to 25\% reduction in electricity costs.}

We overcome predefined stereotypical expectations of user behavior by using a bottom-up data driven two-step clustering approach that first clusters charging sessions and thereafter portfolios of charging sessions per user. From the first clustering (Gaussian Mixture) 13 distinct charging session types were found; 7 types of daytime charging sessions (4 short, 3 medium duration) and 6 types of overnight charging sessions. The second clustering (Partition Around Medoids) clustering result in 9 user types based on their distinct portfolio of charging session types. We found (i) 3 daytime office hours charging user types (ii) 3 overnight user types and (iii) 3 non-typical user types (mixed day and overnight chargers, visitors and car sharing). Three user types show significant peaks at larger battery sizes which affects the time between sessions. Results show that none of the user types display solely stereotypical behavior as the range of behaviors is more varied and more subtle. Analysis of population composition over time revealed that large battery users increase over time in the population. From this we expect that shifts charging portfolios will be observed in future, while the types of charging remain stable.}

The urgent and outstanding issue is how to incorporate the unobserved heterogeneity in loyalty—in other words, how to reflect the effects of the frailty to terminate subscription. This study fills the research gap through an empirical study in Dalian, China. Three different survival models are developed to investigate the mechanism of subscription behaviors, among which the shared frailty model considering the unobserved heterogeneity is demonstrated to be the most appropriate. The results indicate that the historical purchase characteristics are the most important to CB user loyalty modeling and forecasting. Males are more sensitive than females to the number of intermediate stations because of the potentially increased uncertainty in waiting time related to the intermediate stations. The heterogenous frailties resulting from the heterogeneity of the perceptible service quality in terms of convenience and efficiency in subscribing/returning tickets and information availability in the progress of the CB system significantly contribute to user loyalty deviations.}

abstract = {Bus bunching has been a long-standing problem that undermines the efficiency and reliability of public transport services. The most popular countermeasure in practice is to introduce static and dynamic holding control. However, most previous holding control strategies mainly consider local information with a pre-specified headway/schedule, while the global coordination of the whole bus fleet and its long-term effect are often overlooked. To efficiently incorporate global coordination and long-term operation in bus holding, in this paper we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MDRL) framework to develop dynamic and flexible holding control strategies for a bus route. Specifically, we model each bus as an agent that interacts with not only its leader/follower but also all other vehicles in the fleet. To better explore potential strategies, we develop an effective headway-based reward function in the proposed framework. In the learning framework, we model fleet coordination by using a basic actor-critic scheme along with a joint action tracker to better characterize the complex interactions among agents in policy learning, and we apply proximal policy optimization to improve learning performance. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to evaluate the proposed MDRL framework against multiple baseline models that only rely on local information. Our results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework and show the promise of applying MDRL in the coordinative control of public transport vehicle fleets in real-world operations.}

As an innovation compared with the posterior LC risk prediction methods proposed in previous studies, this study develops a pre-emptive LC risk level prediction (P-LRLP) method, which is able to estimate the crash risk level of an LC event in advance before the LC car completes the LC maneuver. The basic concept of this method is to apply a machine learning classifier to predict the LC risk level based on cars’ key space-series features at the beginning of the LC event. To boost the prediction performance, an innovative resampling method, namely ENN-SMOTE-Tomek Link (EST), and an advanced machine learning classifier, namely LightGBM, are proposed and employed in the development of the P-LRLP method. Meanwhile, an algorithm which can measure the stability of the selected key features in terms of the randomness and size of training samples is developed to evaluate the feature selection methods. A digitalized vehicles’ trajectory dataset, the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) is used for method validation. The validation results manifest that the EST can achieve satisfactory resampling performance while Random Forest (RF), as an embedded FS method, achieves remarkable performance on both stability of selected features and prediction of risk level. The results also show that the LC risk level can be most accurately predicted when the LC car moves to the position where the distance between the longitudinal center line of the LC car and the marking line separating the two lanes equals 1.5ft. As an innovative LC risk level prediction technique, the P-LRLP method could be integrated with advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication to remedy potential risky LC maneuver in the future.}

A hierarchical control framework for merging areas is first outlined, where we assume that the merging sequence is decided by a higher control level. The focus of this paper is the lower level of the control framework that establishes a set of control algorithms for cooperative CAV trajectory optimization, defined for different merging scenarios in the presence of mixed traffic. To exploit complete cooperation flexibility of the vehicles, we identify six scenarios, consisting of triplets of vehicles, defined based on the different combinations of CAVs and conventional vehicles. For each triplet, different consecutive movement phases along with corresponding desired distance and speed set-points are designed. Through the movement phases, the CAVs engaged in the triplet cooperate to determine their optimal trajectories aiming at facilitating an efficient merging maneuver, while complying with realistic constraints related to safety and comfort of vehicle occupants. Distinct models are considered for each triplet, and a Model Predictive Control scheme is employed to compute the cooperative optimal control inputs, in terms of acceleration of CAVs, accounting also for human-driven vehicles’ uncertainties, such as drivers’ reaction time and desired speed tracing error. Simulation investigations demonstrate that the proposed cooperative merging algorithms ensure efficient and smooth merging maneuvers while satisfying all the prescribed constraints.}

Solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation takes center stage in yielding solutions to the optimal control problem. At the core of solving the HJB equation is the value function that represents choosing a sequence of actions to optimize the system performance. However, this problem generally becomes intractable for possible discontinuities in the solution and the curse of dimensionality for systems with all but modest dimension. To address these challenges, a neural network is used to approximate the value function to obtain the optimal controls through policy iteration. Furthermore, a saturated operator is embedded in the neural network approximator to handle the difficulty caused by the control and state constraints. This policy iteration can be implemented as an iterative data-driven technique that integrates with the model-based optimal design based on real-time observations. Numerical experiments are conducted to show that the neuro-dynamic programming approach can achieve optimization goals while stabilizing the system by regulating the traffic state to the desired uncongested equilibrium.}

abstract = {Transportation agencies are starting to leverage increasingly-available GPS trajectory data to support their analyses and decision making. While this type of mobility data adds significant value to various analyses, one challenge that persists is lack of information about the types of vehicles that performed the recorded trips, which clearly limits the value of trajectory data in transportation system analysis. To overcome this limitation of trajectory data, a deep Convolutional Neural Network for Vehicle Classification (CNN-VC) is proposed to identify the vehicle’s class from its trajectory. This paper proposes a novel representation of GPS trajectories, which is not only compatible with deep learning models, but also captures both vehicle-motion characteristics and roadway features. To this end, an open source navigation system is also exploited to obtain more accurate information on travel time and distance between GPS coordinates. Before delving into training the CNN-VC model, an efficient programmatic strategy is also designed to label large-scale GPS trajectories by means of vehicle information obtained through Virtual Weigh Station records. Our experimental results reveal that the proposed CNN-VC model consistently outperforms both classical machine learning algorithms and other deep learning baseline methods. From a practical perspective, the CNN-VC model allows us to label raw GPS trajectories with vehicle classes, thereby enriching the data and enabling more comprehensive transportation studies such as derivation of vehicle class-specific origin-destination tables that can be used for planning.}

abstract = {Safer and more efficient airport ground movements can be planned by routing and scheduling systems based on the 4-dimensional trajectory (4DT). In order to achieve the benefits envisioned in the planning stage, an effective taxiing guidance system is indispensable. The Follow-the-Greens (FtG) guidance concept provides an augmented means for 4DT based taxiing with pilot in the loop, which is expected to guide the piloted aircraft by dynamically adjusting the lit position of green ground navigation lamps according to the assigned 4DTs. This paper presents a simulation study to investigate the feasibility of FtG based on a control theoretic modeling of the taxiing system. The 4DT conformance errors with different navigation lamp control strategies are investigated. The key performance indices, including temporal constraint violation and fuel consumption, are analysed. The results demonstrate that it is feasible to follow conflict-free 4DTs through FtG if an appropriate lamp controller is available. The results also highlight the need to proactively handle the potential conformance errors in the routing and scheduling stage.}

The proposed range- and mode-specific purchase subsidy aims to maximize the social benefits from vehicle electrification and automation. In this study, we first classify electric vehicles (EVs) into several classes based on electric driving ranges. Each EV class contains two driving modes, i.e., human driving and automated driving. We provide a simplified model to estimate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and the inconvenience costs of vehicle charging. The nested logit model is used to characterize users’ vehicle choice behaviors. A mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is formulated for the purchase subsidy design problem. A customized branch-and-bound (B&B) method is developed to seek a globally optimal solution to the formulated MINLP model. The numerical examples show that the developed solution method can effectively solve the proposed problem in a reasonable time. The local search strategy embedded in the customized B&B method helps reduce 7\% computation time on average. Some managerial insights obtained from the numerical experiments are discussed, which can help the government agency to achieve a reasonable budget allocation between HDEVs and AEVs with different electric driving ranges.}

This work proposes a probabilistic topic model, adapted from Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to discover representative and interpretable activity categorization from individual-level spatiotemporal data in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, the activity-travel episodes of an individual user are treated as words in a document, and each topic is a distribution over space and time that corresponds to certain type of activity. The model accounts for a mixture of discrete and continuous attributes—the location, start time of day, start day of week, and duration of each activity episode. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using pseudonymized transit smart card data from London, U.K. The results show that the model can successfully distinguish the three most basic types of activities—home, work, and other. As the specified number of activity categories increases, more specific subpatterns for home and work emerge, and both the goodness of fit and predictive performance for travel behavior improve. This work makes it possible to enrich human mobility data with representative and interpretable activity patterns without relying on predefined activity categories or heuristic rules.}

The trajectory of CAVs is continuously optimized via a central methodology, while a new “white” phase is introduced to enforce CHVs to follow their immediate front vehicle. The movement of CHVs is incorporated in the optimization framework utilizing a customized linear car-following model. During the white phase, CAVs lead groups of CHVs through an intersection. The proposed formulation determines the optimal signal indication for each lane-group in each time step. We have developed a receding horizon control framework to solve the problem. The case study results indicate that the proposed methodology successfully controls the mixed CAV-CHV traffic under various CAV market penetration rates and different demand levels. The results reveal that a higher CAV market penetration rate induces more frequent white phase indication compared to green-red signals. The proposed program reduces the total delay by 19.6\%–96.2\% compared to a fully-actuated signal control optimized by a state-of-practice traffic signal timing optimization software.}

An expressway network integrating adjacent signalized intersections was used as the studied object, where no signal light is set on ramps and ramp metering is achieved only through the use of signal lights at adjacent intersections. An improved cell transmission model (CTM) for each segment of the studied object, comprising a mainline, an on-ramp, an off-ramp, side roads, and adjacent intersections, was established. Each node of the system was defined, and a node coupling model integrating adjacent signalized intersections was also established. The coordinated controller was designed, with the signal timings of adjacent intersections used as decision variables. Using the stability theory of complex networks, the concrete pinning nodes corresponding to the subsystems of regulating the inflow from on-ramps adjacent intersections to mainline could be obtained, and the signal timing schemes at intersections could be optimized. The outflow from the mainline to off-ramps adjacent intersections could be appropriately regulated in order to mitigate off-ramp congestion. The proposed method was validated through simulation experiments. The results indicate that the traffic jam phenomenon can be suppressed utmost, off-ramp congestion can be mitigated, and the operational efficiency can be enhanced at minimal control cost.}

It forecasts a congestion score, defined as the ratio of the vehicle accumulation inside a neighborhood to its trip completion rate. Inputs include congestion scores measured at earlier times in neighborhoods within a region, and three other real-time measures of regional traffic. The ideas are tested using Newell’s simplified theory of kinematic waves. Simplified street networks are featured first. Initial tests demonstrate the suitability of the congestion score for characterizing neighborhood traffic conditions, and that the score can be predicted using the four inputs. Further tests of the simplified networks illustrate the value of the deep learning approach, as compared against the use of three benchmark models. A next round of tests shows that the model can be made robust, even to adverse settings. A final round of tests features a pared-down version of the freeway network in the San Francisco Bay Area. The final tests show that the model is scalable. The model is thereafter improved by representing the inputs through weighted undirected graphs that incorporate the route-choice of individuals, and learning features through graph convolutions. A framework for better interpreting the contributions of the model’s inputs to its output is developed. A demonstration of the model’s usefulness in designing traffic control schemes is presented as well.}

The main aim of the framework is to minimize aircraft noise impact on communities around an airport, and the associated fuel consumption. The proposed framework features two consecutive steps. In the first step, for each given Standard Instrument Departure (SID), multi-objective trajectory optimization is utilized to generate a comprehensive set of possible alternative routes. The obtained set is subsequently used as input for the optimization problem in the second step. In this step, the selection of routes for each SID and the distribution of aircraft movements among these routes are optimized simultaneously. To ensure the feasibility of optimized solutions for an entire operational day, the sequence and separation requirements for aircraft on runways and along selected routes are included in this second phase. In order to address these issues, three novel techniques are developed and added to a previously developed multilevel optimization framework, viz., a runway assignment model, a conflict detection algorithm, and a rerouting technique. The proposed framework is applied to a realistic case study at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in the Netherlands, in which 599 departure flights and 13 different SIDs are considered. The optimization results show that the proposed model can offer conflict-free solutions, one of which can lead to a reduction in the number of people annoyed of up to 21\%, and a reduction in fuel consumption of 8\% relative to the reference case solution.}

Large-scale LPR systems have seen rapid development in many parts of the world. However, limited by privacy considerations, LPR data are seldom available to the research community, which lead to huge research gap in data-driven applications. In this study, we propose a complete solution using LPR data for link-based traffic state estimation and prediction for arterial networks. The proposed integrative data-driven framework provides the inference of both cycle maximum queue length states and average travel times of links using LPR data from a subset of intersections in an arterial network. The framework contains three novel data-driven sub-components that are highly customized based on the characteristics of LPR data, including: a traffic signal timing inference model to find signal timing information from the LPR timestamp sequences; a light-weighted queue length approximation model to estimate lane-based cycle maximum queue lengths and a network-wide traffic state inference model to perform network-level estimation and prediction using partially observed data. This study exploits and utilizes the unique features of LPR data and other similar vehicle re-identification data for urban network-wide link-based traffic state estimation and prediction. A six days’ LPR dataset from a small road network in the city of Langfang in China and a more comprehensive link-level field experiment dataset are used to validate the model. Numerical results show that the framework provides good estimation and prediction accuracy. The proposed framework is efficient and calibration-free, which can be easily implemented in urban networks for various real-time traffic monitoring and control applications.}

On the other hand, there is little evidence if smartphone apps that target shared rides have any influence on reducing traffic levels. We study the effects of a shared-mobility service offered by a start-up in Mexico City, Jetty, which is used by travelers to book a shared ride in a car, van or bus. A large-scale user survey was conducted to study trip characteristics, reasons for using the platform and the general travel choices of Jetty users. We calculate travel distance per trip leg, for the current choices and for the modes that riders would have chosen if the platform was not available. We find that the effect of the platform on vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) depends on the rate of empty kilometers introduced by the fleet of vehicles, the substitution of public versus private transport modes, the occupancy rate of Jetty vehicles and assumptions on the occupancy rate of substituted modes. Following a sensitivity analysis approach for variables with unavailable data, we estimate that shared rides in cars increase VKT (in the range of 7 to 10 km/passenger), shared vans are able to decrease VKT (around −0.2 to −1.1 km/passenger), whereas buses are estimated to increase VKT (0.4 to 1.1 km/passenger), in our preferred scenarios. These results stem from the tradeoff between the effects of the occupancy rates per vehicle (larger vehicles are shared by more people) and the attractiveness of the service for car users (shared vans attract more car drivers than buses booked through Jetty). Our findings point to the relevance of shared rides in bigger vehicles such as vans as competitors to low occupancy car services for the future of mobility in cities, and to the improvement of public transportation services through the inclusion of quality attributes as provided by new shared-mobility services.}

This is considered one aspect of resiliency for transportation systems. Although unmet demand has been proposed as one measure of resilience for freight transportation, it has rarely been used for general transportation systems. This study takes unmet demand and total travel time as two measures in modeling the restoration plan problem and proposes a bi-objective bi-level optimization framework to determine an optimal transportation infrastructure restoration plan. The lower-level problem uses Elastic User Equilibrium to model the imbalance between demand and supply and measures the unmet demand for a given transportation network. The upper-level problem, formulated as bi-objective mathematical programming, determines optimal resource allocation for roadway restoration. The bi-level problems are solved by a modified active set algorithm and a network representation method derived from Network Design Problems. The Weighted Sum Method is adopted to solve the Pareto Frontier of this bi-objective optimization problem. The proposed restoration plan optimization method was applied to a typical road network in Sioux Falls, to verify the effectiveness of the methodology. For a given failure scenario, the Pareto Frontier of this bi-objective bi-level optimization problem with various budget levels, cross-referring to the travel efficiency of each solution, was illustrated to demonstrate how the proposed method can support decision-making for road network restoration. To further study the performance of the proposed method, different scenarios were generated with one to five links disrupted and the proposed methodology was applied with different budget levels. The statistical analysis of the optimized solutions for these scenarios demonstrates that a higher budget could help reduce unmet demand in the system by providing more restoration options.}

To optimize driving performance, a reward function is developed by referencing human driving data and combining driving features related to safety, efficiency, and comfort. With the developed reward function, the RL agent learns to control vehicle speed in a fashion that maximizes cumulative rewards, through trials and errors in the simulation environment. To avoid potential unsafe actions, the proposed RL model is incorporated with a collision avoidance strategy for safety checks. The safety check strategy is used during both model training and testing phases, which results in faster convergence and zero collisions. A total of 1,341 car-following events extracted from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset are used to train and test the proposed model. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated by the comparison with empirical NGSIM data and with adaptive cruise control (ACC) algorithm implemented through model predictive control (MPC). The experimental results show that the proposed model demonstrates the capability of safe, efficient, and comfortable velocity control and outperforms human drivers in that it 1) has larger TTC values than those of human drivers, 2) can maintain efficient and safe headways around 1.2s, and 3) can follow the lead vehicle comfortably with smooth acceleration (jerk value is only a third of that of human drivers). Compared with the MPC-based ACC algorithm, the proposed model has better performance in terms of safety, comfort, and especially running speed during testing (more than 200 times faster). The results indicate that the proposed approach could contribute to the development of better autonomous driving systems.

The results of this study offer city planners and policymakers an opportunity to better understand the factors underlying modality styles, and which priorities to focus on when designing a sustainable development plan for resident-centric Smart Cities. According to the results, age, work status, education, auto availability, and the built environments are among the significant contributors to the modality styles.

Our analysis reveals that there is definitely a market for MaaS in Australia. Depending on the service offering, we find that up to 46 per cent of the Australian population would be willing to adopt MaaS. On average, consumers prefer pay-as-you-go schemes to bundled schemes that offer unlimited access to one or more transport modes and services at fixed monthly costs. Local public transport, taxis and long-distance public transport are the most popular transport services; bikeshare is the least popular. Willingness to use MaaS is strongly correlated with age and lifecycle stage: young individuals who are employed full-time are most likely to use MaaS; older adults who have retired from the workforce and whose children have left home are least likely to use MaaS. Our analysis identifies Melbourne, Canberra and Sydney as good markets for MaaS trials and early launches.}

Existing studies only optimized given BSS from the system operational perspective (i.e. rebalancing), with predetermined bike fleet size and rebalancing frequencies. However, the bike fleet size and rebalancing should also be optimized from the life cycle’s perspective. This study proposes a framework to obtain the optimal bike fleet size and rebalancing strategy to minimize the system’s life cycle GHG emissions, integrating a simulation model for fleet size estimation, an optimization model for bike rebalancing, and a life cycle assessment (LCA) model to quantify the system’s GHG emission rate. The framework is applied to a dock-less BSS in Xiamen, China as a case study to evaluate the tradeoff between having more bikes (requiring less rebalancing) and more frequent rebalancing (requiring fewer bikes). Our results show that (1) the current BSS in Xiamen is significantly oversupplied, with only 15\% of current bikes needed to serve the same demands; (2) decreasing bike fleet size through more frequent rebalancing will increase the system’s life cycle GHG emissions; and (3) choosing appropriate rebalancing fleet size, loading capacity, and setting multiple depots can reduce a BSS’ rebalancing GHG emissions.}

Making accurate imputation is critical to many applications in intelligent transportation systems. In this paper, we formulate the missing data imputation problem in spatiotemporal traffic data in a low-rank tensor completion (LRTC) framework and define a novel truncated nuclear norm (TNN) on traffic tensors of location × day × time of day. In particular, we introduce an universal rate parameter to control the degree of truncation on all tensor modes in the proposed LRTC-TNN model, and this allows us to better characterize the hidden patterns in spatiotemporal traffic data. Based on the framework of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), we present an efficient algorithm to obtain the optimal solution for each variable. We conduct numerical experiments on four spatiotemporal traffic data sets, and our results show that the proposed LRTC-TNN model outperforms many state-of-the-art imputation models with missing rates/patterns. Moreover, the proposed model also outperforms other baseline models in extreme missing scenarios.}

However, evidence-based knowledge regarding the impacts of different design configurations, utilization policies, and the design of their access/egress on traffic safety and efficiency is limited. In order to develop an adequate design for DLs, first, a conceptual framework describing the relations and interrelations between these factors and traffic safety and efficiency is needed. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework accounting for the factors that could affect the safety and efficiency of DLs. This conceptual framework is underpinned based on relevant literature on how the deployment of C/AVs, driver behaviour, and DL design and operation affect traffic safety and efficiency. Based on the conceptual framework, the knowledge gaps on DL design for C/AVs were identified and a research agenda, including prioritization of the research needs, is proposed. Following the developed conceptual framework, the necessary building blocks for investigating the impacts of different design configurations, utilization policies, and the design of their access/egress on traffic safety and efficiency are: (1) to specify the types of vehicles with certain capabilities allowed to drive on DLs; (2) to incorporate existing algorithms of C/AVs, which reflect more realistically their behaviour, in both driving simulator experiments and microscopic simulation; (3) to translate the empirical data regarding human behavioural adaptation collected from field tests and driving simulator studies to mathematical models and implement them in traffic flow simulation platform. It is also recommended to develop automated lane change algorithms, taking into account connectivity between C/AVs which can be also implemented in driving simulators and traffic flow simulation platforms. Finally, it is recommended that future research investigate the combined effects of traffic safety and efficiency in designing DLs while considering driver behaviour adaptation and control transitions between manual and automated operation.}

The developed model reproduces the scenario where travelers with their own cars may choose to be a solo-driver, a ridesharing driver, a ridesharing rider, or a public transit passenger while travelers without their own cars can only choose to be either a ridesharing rider or a public transit passenger. The developed model can capture the (clock) time-dependent choices of travelers and the evolution of traffic conditions, i.e., the within-day traffic dynamics. In particular, the within-day traffic dynamics in a city region is modeled through an aggregate traffic representation, i.e., the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD). This paper further develops a doubly dynamical system that examines how the within-day time-dependent travelers’ choices and traffic conditions will evolve from day to day, i.e., the day-to-day dynamics. Based on the doubly dynamical framework, this paper proposes two different congestion pricing schemes that aim to reduce network congestion and improve traffic efficiency. One scheme is to price all vehicles including both solo-driving and ridesharing vehicles (for ridesharing trips, the price is shared by the driver and rider), while the other scheme prices the solo-driving vehicles only in order to encourage ridesharing. The pricing levels (under each scheme) can be determined either through an adaptive adjustment mechanism from period to period driven by observed traffic conditions, or through solving a bi-level optimization problem. Numerical studies are conducted to illustrate the models and effectiveness of the pricing schemes. The results indicate that the emerging ridesharing platform may not necessarily reduce traffic congestion, but the proposed congestion pricing schemes can effectively reduce congestion and improve system performance. While pricing solo-driving vehicles only may encourage ridesharing, it can be less effective in reducing the overall congestion when compared to pricing both solo-driving and ridesharing vehicles.}

Although conventional data may offer good ‘content’, it is widely observed that it lacks context i.e. who and why people are travelling. Transportation modelling has developed within these boundaries, with implications for the planning, design and management of transportation systems and policy-making. This paper establishes the potential of passively collected GPS-based “Track & Trace” (T&T) datasets of individual mobility profiles towards enhancing transportation modelling and policy-making. T&T is a type of New and Emerging Data Form (NEDF), lying within the broader ‘Big Data’ paradigm, and is typically collected using mobile phone sensors and related technologies. These capture highly grained mobility content and can be linked to the phone owner/user behavioural choices and other individual context. Our meta-analysis of existing literature related to spatio-temporal mobile phone data demonstrates that NEDF’s, and in particular T&T data, have had little mention to date within an applied transportation planning and policy context. We thus establish there is an opportunity for policy-makers, transportation modellers, researchers and a wide range of stakeholders to collaborate in developing new analytic approaches, revise existing models and build the skills and related capacity needed to lever greatest value from the data, as well as to adopt new business models that could revolutionise citizen participation in policy-making. This is of particular importance due to the growing awareness in many countries for a need to develop and monitor efficient cross-sectoral policies to deliver sustainable communities.}

In this study, we develop an innovative data-driven approach for devising efficient vehicle relocation policy for OMS that (1) proactively relocates vehicles before the demand is observed and (2) reduces the inequality among drivers’ income so that the proactive relocation policy is fair and is likely to be followed by drivers. Our approach represents the fusion of optimization and machine learning methods, which comprises three steps: First, we formulate the optimal proactive relocation as an optimal/stable matching problems and solve for global optimal solutions based on historical data. Second, the optimal solutions are then grouped and fed to train the deep learning models which consist of fully connected layers and long short-term memory networks. Low rank approximation is introduced to reduce the model complexity and improve the training performances. Finally, we use the trained model to predict the relocation policy which can be implemented in real time. We conduct comprehensive numerical experiments and sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the performances of the proposed method using New York City taxi data. The results suggest that our method will reduce empty mileage per trip by 54–70\% under the optimal matching strategy, and a 25–32\% reduction can also be achieved by following the stable matching strategy. We also validate that the predicted relocation policies are robust in the presence of uncertain passenger demand level and passenger trip-requesting behavior.}

abstract = {This study proposes an addition to the architecture of the context-aware Driver Assistance Systems (DASs) by introducing a context identification layer to the reasoning subsystem. The proposed layer contains two algorithms that work in sequence: the infrastructure detection algorithm and the driver classification algorithm, respectively. The infrastructure detection algorithm aims to identify intersection-related driving when the driver adjusts his or her behavior due to the presence of an intersection ahead. Then, the driver classification algorithm categorizes drivers into cautious, normal, and aggressive at both locations. Data from 64 drivers in a Naturalistic Driving Study was used to prove the concept of the proposed layer. Several behavioral measures were extracted, including following distance, relative speed, headway, acceleration, time-to-collision, and jerk. These behavioral measures were then used to train the algorithms in the context identification layer. The results of both algorithms supported the concept of the proposed layer. These results have implications related to driver behaviors including i) the intersection-related driving behavior can be detected, ii) the drivers tend to be relatively aggressive at intersections when compared to segments, and iii) the driver classification, which ignores the driver’s relative location to intersections, were more likely to misclassify drivers as aggressive when they were in high intersection density areas such as downtown cores. The findings of this study emphasized the importance of context-aware DAS architecture that acknowledges and integrates the variation in driver behavior due to both a change in the surrounding environment and drivers’ individual needs.}

abstract = {Real-time crash prediction is essential for proactive traffic safety management. However, developing an accurate prediction model is challenging as the traffic data of crash and non-crash cases are extremely imbalanced. Most of the previous studies undersampled non-crash cases to balance the data, which may not capture the heterogeneity of the full non-crash data. This study aims to use the emerging deep learning method called deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) model to fully understand the traffic data leading to crashes. With the full understanding of the traffic data of crashes, the DCGAN model could generate more synthetic data related to crashes to balance the dataset. All non-crash data could be used for developing the prediction models. To capture the correlations between different variables, the data are augmented to 2-D matrix as the input for the DCGAN model. The suggested model is evaluated based on data from expressways and compared to two counterparts: (1) synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE); (2) random undersampling technique. The results suggest that the DCGAN could better understand the crash data characteristics by generating data with better fit of the real data distribution. Four different crash prediction algorithms (i.e., logistic regression model, support vector machine, artificial neural network, and convolutional neural network) are developed based on each balanced data and totally twelve models were estimated. The results indicate that the convolutional neural network model based on the DCGAN balanced data could provide the best prediction accuracy, validating that the proposed oversampling method could be used for the data balance. Besides, compared to other two models, only the DCGAN-based model could identify the significant effects of speed difference between the upstream and downstream locations which could help guide traffic management strategies. With the prediction model developed based on the balanced data by DCGAN, it is expected that more crashes could be predicted and prevented with more appropriate proactive traffic safety management strategies such as Variable Speed Limits (VSL) and Dynamic Message Signs (DMS).}

The empirical high-fidelity trajectory data of 621 vehicles were extracted. The major findings include: (1) Macroscopic perspective: Three traffic states (free flow, metastable traffic flow, and jam) were observed with different spatiotemporal physical structures and their critical characteristics in a continuous first-order phase transition. The spontaneous spatiotemporal traffic breakdown and capacity drop were also captured, the critical points of which were also recorded. The features of widening synchronized flow pattern, general pattern, and the nature of nucleation described in the three-phase traffic theory were identified, which provides a new observational cognition for congestion formation and development. (2) Microscopic perspective: The impact of lane changes on immediate vehicles were modeled and quantified with the fluctuation magnitude of speed and the theoretical lag distance, which provides a method to identify the source of perturbation and determine the microscopic critical threshold of vehicle between macroscopic phase transitions. The research shows a lane changer could cause a forced deceleration of an immediate vehicle on a target lane after inserting itself with critical spacing headway below approximately 15–20 m. The average deceleration duration of vehicles in different traffic states can be captured as crucial driving features from downstream to help predict traffic state transition in a real bottleneck.}

Due to the widespread usage of mobile phones, there have been several trajectory-based studies focusing on extracting the characteristics of human mobility from georeferenced mobile phone data. Mobile positioning data is generally generated as scattered points in CDRs (Call Detail Records). Even though CDR data can be regarded as an inexpensive scalable source of information on human mobility, mobility studies in urban settings based on such data sources still prove to be a research challenge due to the coarseness of CDR spatial granularity. Motivated by the need for transforming large-scale CDRs to movement trajectories, the present study offers a new solution which is made of two principal building blocks: (1) Developing a Bayesian-based induction method through adopting a GIS-based wave propagation model to solve the GSM-based localization problem when methods such as triangulation are not applicable due to the lack of measurements from more than one base station; (2) Reconstruction of movement trajectories from cellular location information using overlapping relations existing between observed cells as well as detection of ping-pong phenomena as auxiliary information. A case study employing CDR and GPS records obtained from an experimental survey on one of the central urban zones of Tehran was conducted, which showed the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in comparison to current approaches with respect to three perspectives, including movement path exploration, individual-oriented movement features extraction, and crowd-movement modelling.}

In this study, we developed a reinforcement learning-based approach for modeling and simulation of people mass movement using the global positioning system (GPS) data. Unlike traditional travel demand modeling approaches, our method focuses on the problem of inferring the spatio-temporal preferences of individuals from the observed trajectories, and is based on inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) techniques. We applied the model to the data collected from a smartphone application and attempted to replicate a large amount of the population’s daily movement by incorporating with agent-based multi-modal traffic simulation technologies.

The approach uses traffic conflicts extracted from informative vehicle trajectories as an intermediate for crash prediction and develops generalized extreme value (GEV) models based on conflict extremes. Moreover, a Bayesian hierarchical structure is developed for the GEV model to combine conflict extremes of different intersections, and the aim is to further improve safety estimates through borrowing strength from different intersections and accounting for non-stationarity and unobserved heterogeneity in conflict extremes. The proposed approach was applied to four signalized intersections in City of Surrey, British Columbia. Traffic conflicts measured by modified time to collision and three cycle-level traffic parameters (traffic volume, shock wave area, and platoon ratio) were extracted from collected video data using computer vision techniques, and a best fitted model was then developed. Two safety indices, risk of crash (RC) and return level of a cycle (RLC), were derived from the GEV model to quantitatively measure the safety cycle-by-cycle. The results show that the non-negative RC can directly point out cycles with crash prone traffic conditions with RC > 0, and RLC is a more flexible safety index which can differentiate between safety levels even for “safe” cycles with RC = 0. The real time crash prediction results are validated at an aggregate level by comparing to observed crashes.}

Unlike approaches based solely on computational intensive optimization models, the proposed methodology is based on three eminently solvable analytical models. These formulations sequentially apply train holding and speed control strategies with the objective of reducing social cost. In the initial phase immediately following a disruption, one of the holding models determines the magnitude of the holds to be imposed on each train on the line. Once the trains are moving again and the recovery period begins, the other holding model and the speed control model take over, defining respectively the train holdings at each of the stations and the train speeds between them. Simulation results demonstrate that the framework’s performance is similar to that of an optimization model applying overall control to the entire system. The methodology can also be used to reveal the effects of different relevant parameters on the control decisions to be taken.}

In this paper, we investigate the intrinsic long-term driving characteristics and its short-term changes after driver experiences an external stimulus. A long- and short-term driving (LSTD) model is proposed to incorporate such changes into car-following driving behavior modelling. The long-term driving characteristics are extracted through a cluster analysis, and the changes after an external stimulus are identified and measured as the indicator of the short-term driving characteristics. NGSIM data are used to demonstrate the existence of LSTD characteristics, and the soundness of the LSTD model. Two classical car-following models (i.e. the intelligent driver model, Gipps’ model) are integrated with the LSTD model, and the integrated models show a promising performance as the errors decrease by 36.7\% and 35.7\%, respectively.}

abstract = {Traffic forecasting is a classical task for traffic management and it plays an important role in intelligent transportation systems. However, since traffic data are mostly collected by traffic sensors or probe vehicles, sensor failures and the lack of probe vehicles will inevitably result in missing values in the collected raw data for some specific links in the traffic network. Although missing values can be imputed, existing data imputation methods normally need long-term historical traffic state data. As for short-term traffic forecasting, especially under edge computing and online prediction scenarios, traffic forecasting models with the capability of handling missing values are needed. In this study, we consider the traffic network as a graph and define the transition between network-wide traffic states at consecutive time steps as a graph Markov process. In this way, missing traffic states can be inferred step by step and the spatial–temporal relationships among the roadway links can be incorporated. Based on the graph Markov process, we propose a new neural network architecture for spatial–temporal data forecasting, i.e. the graph Markov network (GMN). By incorporating the spectral graph convolution operation, we also propose a spectral graph Markov network (SGMN). The proposed models are compared with baseline models and tested on three real-world traffic state datasets with various missing rates. Experimental results show that the proposed GMN and SGMN can achieve superior prediction performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Besides, the proposed models’ parameters, weights, and predicted results are comprehensively analyzed and visualized.}

Three crowding metrics are considered: (1) the probability of getting a seat on boarding, (2) the expected travel time standing, and (3) the excess perceived travel time compared to uncrowded conditions. The methodology combines prediction models of passenger loads and alighting counts based on lasso regularized regression and multivariate PLS regression, a probabilistic seat allocation model and a bias correction step in order to predict the crowding metrics. Depending on data availability, the prediction method can use a combination of historical passenger counts, real-time vehicle locations and real-time passenger counts. We evaluate the prediction methodology in a real-world case study for a bus line in Stockholm, Sweden. The results indicate that personalized, predictive crowding information that is robust to varying data availability can be provided sufficiently early to be useful to travellers. The methodology is of value for agencies and operators in order to increase the attractiveness and capacity utilization of public transport.}

abstract = {Operating speed profiles represent drivers’ responses to roadway geometry and are widely used to evaluate safety performance of roadway design. To predict operating speed profile, the majority of early research followed a two-step modeling procedure: (1) estimate speeds at start, middle, and end points of road segments, and (2) fill the profile between the points with assumed driver behavior. This sparse-spot-based modeling strategy has been shown to be inadequate for capturing the complex speed changes resulting from the overlapping horizontal and vertical curves on mountainous roads. This paper proposes a high-resolution modeling approach for operating speeds measured in a dense series of equidistant spots along a road. This type of model is more conducive to analysis of mountainous freeway alignments as operating speeds are predicted along the entire roadway. The high-resolution data were obtained, using the Tongji University Driving Simulator, from a simulated section of mountainous freeway. The estimated linear mixed model includes geometric variables representing the road upstream and downstream of each data collection spot. To determine the suitable lengths of the upstream and downstream segments, the data were extracted from several alternative segment lengths, including fixed lengths and varying downstream length accordingly to sight distances. The model with a spherical structure of error covariance, using geometric data extracted from 300-meter upstream and downstream segments, performed the best. An out-of-sample evaluation of the model has the mean absolute error of 3.2 km/h and the root mean square error of 4.2 km/h, which indicates a promising prediction ability of the proposed model.}

There is an emerging trend of using reinforcement learning methods for VSL control. Currently, deep learning is enabling reinforcement learning to develop autonomous control agents for problems that were previously intractable. In this paper, a more effective deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model is developed for differential variable speed limit (DVSL) control, in which dynamic and distinct speed limits among lanes can be imposed. The proposed DRL model uses a novel actor-critic architecture to learn a large number of discrete speed limits in a continuous action space. Different reward signals, such as total travel time, bottleneck speed, emergency braking, and vehicular emissions are used to train the DVSL controller, and a comparison between these reward signals is conducted. The proposed DRL-based DVSL controllers are tested on a freeway with a simulated recurrent bottleneck. The simulation results show that the DRL based DVSL control strategy is able to improve the safety, efficiency and environment-friendliness of the freeway. In order to verify whether the controller generalizes to real world implementation, we also evaluate the generalization of the controllers on environments with different driving behavior attributes. and the robustness of the DRL agent is observed from the results.}

The implication is that it is currently not possible to identify the contribution of individual system components – stations and track segments – to overall passenger delay and thus prioritize investments and disruption management measures accordingly. To this end, we propose a novel method for attributing passenger delays to individual transit network elements from individual passenger trajectories. We decompose the delay along a passenger trajectory into its corresponding track segment delay, initial waiting time and transfer delay. Using these delay components, we construct a solvable system of equations, using which the delays on each network component can be computed. The estimation method is demonstrated on one year of data from the Washington DC metro network. Our approach produces promising results by compressing millions of individual trajectories into 3D networks, leading to a dimensionality reduction of 94\%. Moreover, the mean slack variable value (that can be interpreted as proxies for estimation errors) is smaller than five seconds per passenger, and has the desired positive sign for almost 90\% of all travelers. Applications using the estimation results include revealing network-wide recurrent delay patterns, modeling delay propagation and detecting disruptions.}

Theoretical studies have verified that carpooling is not only beneficial to drivers and passengers but also to the environment. Nevertheless, despite carpooling having a huge potential market in car commuters, it is not widely used in practice worldwide. In this paper, we develop a passenger-to-driver matching model based on the characteristics of a private-car based carpooling service, and propose an estimation method for time-based costs as well as the psychological costs of carpooling trips, taking into account the potential motivations and preferences of potential carpoolers. We test the model using commuting data for the Greater London from the UK Census 2011 and travel-time data from Uber. We investigate the service sensitivity to varying carpooling participant rates and fee-sharing ratios with the aim of improving matching performance at least cost. Finally, to illustrate how our matching model might be used, we test some practical carpooling promotion instruments. We found that higher participant role flexibility in the system can improve matching performance significantly. Encouraging commuters to walk helps form more carpooling trips and further reduces carbon emissions. Different fee-sharing ratios can influence matching performance, hence determination of optimal pricing should be based on the specific matching model and its cost parameters. Disincentives like parking charges and congestion charges seem to have a greater effect on carpooling choice than incentives like preferential parking and subsidies. The proposed model and associated findings provide valuable insights for designing an effective matching system and incentive scheme for carpooling services in practice.}

Previous research has demonstrated that their integration can significantly improve the quality of a train timetable, especially for commuter railways with flexible service frequencies and multiple stop plans. However, solving the dilemma of the mathematical tractability and practicality of the model is still an open challenge. To obtain a high-quality timetable and simultaneously consider more realistic conditions, an integrated combination optimization model of both train stop plans and timetables under time-dependent passenger demand is proposed in this article. More realistic conditions, such as no predefined schedule, a variable total number of trains and oversaturation, are taken into account. The problem is modeled as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP) to optimize passenger travel efficiency and mainly consists of (1) the total waiting time at stations, (2) the delay time for trains due to a train stop, and (3) the minimization of the total train running time. An extended adaptive large-scale neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm is developed to solve the problem. A numerical experiment is designed to test the validity of the model and the algorithm. Then, the integrated approach is applied in a real-world case. The results show that the proposed approach can simultaneously reduce the passenger total waiting time and delay time as well as the train running time within a short computation time and demonstrate the effectiveness of the model and the approach.}

In this paper, we propose the Multiple Spatio-Temporal Information Fusion Networks (MSTIF-Net), a novel deep learning approach to better fuse multiple situation awareness information and graphs representation. MSTIF-Net model integrates structures of Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN), Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) and Sequence to Sequence Learning (Seq2seq) model to obtain the joint latent representation of urban ride-hailing situation that contain both Euclidean spatial features and non-Euclidean structural features, and capture the spatio-temporal dynamics. We evaluate the proposed model on two real-world large scale urban traffic datasets and the experimental studies demonstrate MSTIF-Net has achieved superior performance of urban ride-Hailing demand prediction compared with some traditional state-of-art baseline models.}

The proposed model takes into account the spatial dimension of parking, where clusters of curbside spaces and private shareable ones are distributed over different locations. On the supply side, private parking owners can “sell the right-of-use” of their spaces to the platform based on the rent they can receive and the inconvenience they would experience due to sharing. On the demand side, travelers make their parking choices of space type (curbside or shared) and location under given parking capacities and prices. The resulting parking choice equilibrium is formulated as a minimization problem and several properties of the equilibrium are identified and discussed. The platform operator’s pricing strategy, i.e., rent paid to space owners and price charged on space users, can significantly affect the private parking owners’ sharing decisions and the choice equilibrium of parking users. In this context, we examine the platform operator’s optimal pricing strategies for revenue-maximization or social-cost-minimization. Numerical examples are also presented to illustrate the models and results and to provide further insights.}

abstract = {Ride-sharing services, that have been growing in recent years with the start of network service companies, will be further enhanced by the recently emerging trend of applications for autonomous vehicles for future traveler mobility. One fundamental question that transportation managers should address is how to capture the endogenous traffic patterns involving the new and uncertain elements facing future transportation planning and management. By concentrating on one ideal system optimal (SO) scenario, in which (i) all vehicles are autonomous, or can be centrally guided and (ii) all passengers’ pickup/drop-off trip requests can be given at the beginning, this paper aims to integrate travel demand, vehicle supply, and limited infrastructure. Available ride-shared and autonomous vehicles, from different (real/virtual) depots, can be optimally assigned to satisfy passengers’ trip requests, while considering the endogenous congestion in capacitated networks. A number of decomposition approaches are adopted in this research. Focusing on this primal problem, we propose an arc-based vehicle-based integer linear programming model in space-time-state (STS) networks, which is solved by Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition. From the perspective of dynamic traffic assignment, a space-time-state (STS) path-based flow-based linear programming model is also provided as an approximation according to the mapping information between vehicle and passenger, and between a vehicle and the space-time arc in each STS path in our priori-generated column pool. Finally, numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate our decomposition approaches and their computation efficiency. From our preliminary experiments, we have a few interesting observations: (i) without considering road congestion, the network performance/efficiency could be overestimated; (ii) passengers’ required pickup and drop-off time windows could be a buffer to mitigate road congestion, without impacting system performance; (iii) the ride-sharing service could reduce the total transportation system cost under centralized control.}

With the growing demands for global shipping service, vessel destination prediction has shown its significant role in improving the efficiency of decision making in industry and ensuring a safe and efficient maritime traffic environment. Currently, most vessel destination prediction methods focus on regional destination prediction, which has restrictions on destinations and regions. Thus, this paper proposes a general AIS (Automatic Identification System) data-driven model for vessel destination prediction. In this random forest-based model, the similarity between the vessel’s traveling and historical trajectories are measured and utilized to predict the destination. The destination of the historical trajectory, which shares the highest similarity with the traveling trajectory, is predicted as the vessel’s destination. The method is different from previous work which used maritime records as input to predict the destination. In our method, a historical trajectory database was generated from more than 141 million AIS records, which covers 534,824 traveling patterns between ports and more than 5.9 million historical trajectories. Comparative studies were carried out to validate the performance of the proposed model, where eleven state-of-the-art trajectories similarity measurement methods combined with two different decision strategies were implemented and compared. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model combined with the port frequency-based decision strategy achieves the best prediction accuracy on 35,937 testing trajectories.}

This paper combines existing data sources with an emerging technology for object detection to estimate the number of passengers that are left behind on subway platforms. The methodology proposed in this study has been developed and applied to the subway in Boston, Massachusetts. Trains are not currently equipped with automated passenger counters, and farecard data is only collected on entry to the system. An analysis of crowding from inferred origin–destination data was used to identify stations with high likelihood of passengers being left behind during peak hours. Results from North Station during afternoon peak hours are presented here. Image processing and object detection software was used to count the number of passengers that were left behind on station platforms from surveillance video feeds. Automatically counted passengers and train operations data were used to develop logistic regression models that were calibrated to manual counts of left behind passengers on a typical weekday with normal operating conditions. The models were validated against manual counts of left behind passengers on a separate day with normal operations. The results show that by fusing passenger counts from video with train operations data, the number of passengers left behind during a day’s rush period can be estimated within 10\% of their actual number.}

Here, any obstacle (neighboring entity on the road) to the subject vehicle is treated as a finite scalar risk field that is formulated in the predicted configuration space of the subject vehicle. The driving risk estimate is the strength of the risk field at the subject vehicle’s future location. This risk field is formulated as the product of two factors: collision probability and expected crash energy. The collision probability with neighboring vehicles is estimated based on probabilistic motion predictions. The risk can be assessed for a single time step or over multiple future time steps, depending on the required temporal resolution of the estimates. We verified the single step approach in three near-crash situations from a naturalistic dataset and in cut-in and hard-braking scenarios with simulation and showed the application of the multi-step approach in selecting the safest path in a lane-drop section. The risk descriptions from the proposed approach qualitatively reflect the narration of the situation and are in general consistent with Time To Collision. Compared to current surrogate measures of safety, the proposed risk estimate provides a better basis to assess the driving safety of an individual vehicle by considering the uncertainty over the future ambient traffic state and magnitude of expected crash consequences. The proposed driving risk model can be used as a component of intelligent vehicle safety applications and as a comprehensive surrogate measure for assessing traffic safety.}

Recent advances in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technology have led to increasing interest in distance- or usage-based road pricing as an effective alternative to traditional facility-, cordon- and area-based pricing that typically rely on fixed infrastructure. In this paper, we propose the use of feature-variant clustering methods, OPTICS and HDBSCAN*, as a systematic approach for tolling zone definition to operationalize distance-based tolling schemes. Subsequently, we develop a framework for predictive distance-based toll optimization to evaluate network performance for the various tolling zone definitions derived from the aforementioned feature-variant clustering methods. In this framework, for a specific tolling zone definition, tolling function parameters are optimized using a simulation-based Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) model operating within a rolling horizon scheme. Predictive optimization is integrated with the guidance information generation. Behavioral models capture drivers’ responses to the tolls in terms of trip cancellation and choices of mode, route and departure time. Experiments on the real-world Expressway and Major Arterials network of Singapore demonstrate improved effectiveness of distance-based toll optimization given tolling zone definitions derived from feature-variant clustering, compared to fixed cordon-based pricing, adaptive cordon-based pricing, as well as distance-based pricing with ad hoc tolling zone definitions. Further, the results indicate that the use of the marginal link cost tolls as a clustering feature produces the most robust tolling zone definitions and yields significant improvements in social welfare over ad hoc zone definitions and cordon-pricing. Finally, experiments on the Boston CBD network also demonstrate the effectiveness of distance-based toll optimization schemes on urban traffic networks.}

There has been a pronounced progress in the use of machine learning models for crash events assessment by the transportation safety research community in recent years. However, little attention has been paid so far to evaluating real-time crash occurrences within information fusion systems. The main aim of this paper is to design and validate an ensemble fusion framework founded on the use of various base classifiers that operate on fused features and a Meta classifier that learns from base classifiers’ results to acquire more performant crash predictions. A data-driven approach was adopted to investigate the potential of fusing four real-time and continuous categories of features namely physiological signals, driver maneuvering inputs, vehicle kinematics and weather covariates in order to systematically identify the crash strongest precursors through feature selection techniques. Moreover, a resampling-based scheme, including Bagging and Boosting, is conducted to generate diversity in learner combinations comprising Bayesian Learners (BL), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). To ensure that the proposed framework provide powerful and stable decisions, an imbalance-learning strategy was adopted using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE) to address the class imbalance problem as crash events usually occur in rare instances. The findings show that Boosting depicted the highest performance within the fusion scheme and can accomplish a maximum of 93.66\% F1 score and 94.81\% G-mean with Naïve Bayes, Bayesian Networks, k-NN and SVM with MLP as the Meta-classifier. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first attempt at establishing a fusing framework on the basis of data from the four aforementioned categories and fusion models while accounting for class imbalance. Overall, the method and findings provide new insights into crash prediction and can be harnessed as a promising tool to improve intervention efforts related to traffic intelligent transportation systems.}

abstract = {Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication-enabled cooperation of multiple connected vehicles improves the safety and efficiency of our transportation systems. However, the joining and leaving of vehicles and unreliability of wireless communication channels will cause the switching of communication topology among vehicles, thus affecting the performance of multi-vehicle systems. To address this issue, a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) method is proposed for multi-vehicle system control under switching communication topologies. First, an open-loop optimization problem is formulated, within which neighbor-deviation and self-deviation penalties and constraints are incorporated to ensure stability. Then, a DMPC algorithm is designed for multi-vehicle systems subject to switching communication topologies. For the closed-loop system, the convergence of predicted terminal states is proved based on the neighbor-deviation constraint. After that, closed-loop system stability is analysed based on a common Lyapunov function (CLF) defined using a joint neighbor set. It is proved that asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system can be achieved through a sufficient condition on the weight matrices of the open-loop optimization problem. Numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DMPC controller.}

abstract = {Cycle-based traffic volume estimation is important for the dynamic evaluation and optimization of signal control schemes at intersections. With the development of intelligent mobility and connected vehicle technologies, massive high-resolution vehicle trajectory data have become available, which can provide a rich source of information for estimating traffic flow parameters at signalized intersections. Existing methods for traffic volume estimation using sampled vehicle trajectories are commonly driven by shockwave or probabilistic models, in which the traffic volume estimation is usually modelled as a parameter estimation problem. These methods commonly require certain assumptions for the vehicle arrival distribution and a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queuing rule. However, these model-driven methods have limitations when the vehicle arrival distribution is unknown or when there is more than one lane for the same movement at an intersection approach, as the FIFO rule is no longer true. In addition, the accuracy and stability of these models remain challenging under low penetration rates. In this paper, we propose a tensor decomposition method to estimate cycle-based traffic volume at signalized intersections using sampled vehicle trajectories. Unlike the existing model-driven methods, the proposed method is purely data-driven and does not rely on any prerequisite assumptions for the arrival distributions and queuing rules. In the proposed method, the traffic volume of each cycle is first divided into a known part and an unknown part, based on the queuing position of the last queued sample vehicle. Then, these two parts of the volume as a whole, along with two relevant traffic observations (i.e., the number of sampled vehicles and the observation duration), are then integrated into a three-dimensional tensor. This tensor can effectively preserve the temporal correlations between adjacent cycles and the interrelationships among the traffic observations. Finally, the problem of cycle-based traffic estimation is transformed into a tensor completion problem, and the Tucker decomposition method is adopted to solve the completion problem. The proposed method is evaluated using both empirical and simulation data. The results indicate that the proposed method is capable of producing accurate and reliable estimates for cycle-based traffic volumes even under low penetration rates, i.e., less than 5\%.}

The three major components that are estimated in the present context are MFD shapes, regional trip lengths and path flow distribution. A trip enrichment scheme based on the map matching process is proposed for the trips that have sparser records. Time dependent penetration rates are estimated by fusing the OD matrix and the Loop Detector Data (LDD). Two different types of penetration rates of vehicles are proposed based on the OD flow and the trips starting within an origin, respectively. The estimated MFDs based on two types of penetration rates are stable with very low scatter. In the following step, macro-paths and their corresponding trip lengths are estimated. This work is the first to present empirical evidences of the dynamic evolution of mean trip lengths over the day, which is very difficult to capture with other types of data sources. The last component is the time dependent path flow distributions between the different macro-paths for a given OD pair. The manuscript is concluded by presenting the time evolution of the User Equilibrium (UE) gap for different macroscopic OD pairs. It is noticed that UE principle holds true most of the time, except for OD pairs that have macro-paths transversing through congested reservoirs, especially during peak hours.}

However, AVs’ benefits also introduce a serious potential challenge, in the form of complex interactions with human-driven vehicles (HVs). The emergence of AVs introduces uncertainty in the behavior of human actors and in the impact of the AV manufacturer on autonomous driving design. This paper thus aims to investigate how AVs affect road safety and to design socially optimal liability rules in comparative negligence for AVs and human drivers. A unified game is developed, including a Nash game between human drivers, a Stackelberg game between the AV manufacturer and HVs, and a Stackelberg game between the lawmaker and other users. We also establish the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium of the game. The game is then simulated with numerical examples to investigate the emergence of human drivers’ moral hazard, the AV manufacturer’s role in traffic safety, and the lawmaker’s role in liability design. Our findings demonstrate that human drivers could develop moral hazard if they perceive their road environment has become safer and an optimal liability rule design is crucial to improve social welfare with advanced transportation technologies. More generally, the game-theoretic model developed in this paper provides an analytical tool to assist policy-makers in AV policymaking and hopefully mitigate uncertainty in the existing regulation landscape about AV technologies.}

This paper demonstrates that DNNs can provide economic information as complete as classical discrete choice models (DCMs). The economic information from DNNs includes choice predictions, choice probabilities, market shares, substitution patterns of alternatives, social welfare, probability derivatives, elasticities, marginal rates of substitution, and heterogeneous values of time. Unlike DCMs, DNNs can automatically learn utility functions and reveal behavioral patterns that are not prespecified by domain experts, particularly when the sample size is large. However, the economic information obtained from DNNs can be unreliable when the sample size is small, because of three challenges associated with the automatic learning capacity: high sensitivity to hyperparameters, model non-identification, and local irregularity. The first challenge is related to the statistical challenge of balancing approximation and estimation errors of DNNs, the second to the optimization challenge of identifying the global optimum in the DNN training, and the third to the robustness challenge of mitigating locally irregular patterns of estimated functions. To demonstrate the strength and challenges, we estimated the DNNs using a stated preference survey from Singapore and a revealed preference data from London, extracted the full list of economic information from the DNNs, and compared them with those from the DCMs. We found that the economic information either aggregated over trainings or population is more reliable than the disaggregate information of the individual observations or trainings, and that larger sample size, hyperparameter searching, model ensemble, and effective regularization can significantly improve the reliability of the economic information extracted from the DNNs. Future studies should investigate the requirement of sample size, better ensemble mechanisms, other regularizations and DNN architectures, better optimization algorithms, and robust DNN training methods to address DNNs three challenges to provide more reliable economic information for DNN-based choice models.}

For each segment, a global map matching strategy is employed to identify the best match. The algorithm is compared against three state-of-the-art map matching algorithms from the literature. To get ground truth data, we design and perform numerous test drives with predefined paths that have a total length of 234 km. GPS trajectories recorded during the test drives are used to evaluate the algorithms. Our numerical experiments show the proposed algorithm improves match efficiency by up to two order of magnitude compared to the benchmark algorithms. Importantly, it achieves this remarkable speedup with negligible losses in matching accuracy.}

However, the potential of RNN-based models in traffic forecasting has not yet been fully exploited in terms of the predictive power of spatial–temporal data and the capability of handling missing data. In this paper, we focus on RNN-based models and attempt to reformulate the way to incorporate RNN and its variants into traffic prediction models. A stacked bidirectional and unidirectional LSTM network architecture (SBU-LSTM) is proposed to assist the design of neural network structures for traffic state forecasting. As a key component of the architecture, the bidirectional LSTM (BDLSM) is exploited to capture the forward and backward temporal dependencies in spatiotemporal data. To deal with missing values in spatial–temporal data, we also propose a data imputation mechanism in the LSTM structure (LSTM-I) by designing an imputation unit to infer missing values and assist traffic prediction. The bidirectional version of LSTM-I is incorporated in the SBU-LSTM architecture. Two real-world network-wide traffic state datasets are used to conduct experiments and published to facilitate further traffic prediction research. The prediction performance of multiple types of multi-layer LSTM or BDLSTM models is evaluated. Experimental results indicate that the proposed SBU-LSTM architecture, especially the two-layer BDLSTM network, can achieve superior performance for the network-wide traffic prediction in both accuracy and robustness. Further, comprehensive comparison results show that the proposed data imputation mechanism in the RNN-based models can achieve outstanding prediction performance when the model’s input data contains different patterns of missing values.}

While advance-notice events have received a great deal of attention in the literature of disaster management, not much attention so far has been given to the no-notice events mainly because of the scarcity of data. As an attempt to address this critical gap, the current study proposes a disaggregate evacuation demand framework to understand evacuees’ travel behavior in case of no-notice emergency events. The proposed framework comprises four main steps of evacuation decision, evacuation planning, tour formation, and activity schedule update. This article is dedicated to the introduction of the framework structure and elaboration on the tour formation step. In this step, we first estimate the total number of intermediate stops, travel time, and distance of the evacuation tours for those who decide to evacuate through a joint modeling structure and then, determine the type of each intermediate stop (if any). It is found that a broad range of factors including evacuees’ demographic profiles, built-environment attributes, and characteristics of the disastrous event plays a significant role in people’s evacuation behavior during no-notice emergency events. The findings of this study can assist responsible agencies in understanding evacuees’ complex behavior, and consequently, in devising effective strategies to alleviate economic damages and casualties resulted by such events.}

abstract = {The current study shows the impact of distraction in designing the intelligent in-vehicle systems for assisting the drivers to make stop/cross decision at the onset of yellow signal. In total, 83 participants drove through a simulated urban scenario with six signalised intersections. Firstly, the time taken to execute the stop/cross decision was statistically modelled by using Weibull AFT (Accelerated Failure Time) models. The results showed that compared to the baseline, eating and drinking tasks reduced the stopping time by 6\% and 7\% respectively. For the crossing encounters, the eating task caused 12\% increment in crossing time compared to the baseline. This analysis was followed by modelling the success rates of the executed decisions with binary logistic models. The success rates of the stopping decision showed that reduction in the time lapsed in executing the decision led to failure in stopping the vehicle before the stop line. Similarly, an increment in the time taken to execute the crossing decision led to reduced probability of successfully crossing the stop line within the yellow duration. Hence, the results suggest that the design of the smart assistance system for decision making at the onset of yellow signal should be based on the success rate of the decision which is dependent on the time lapsed in executing the decision. Moreover, the presence of distracting activities should be considered as an input parameter while designing the assistance system.}

abstract = {Traffic signals, while serving an important function to coordinate vehicle movements through intersections, also cause frequent stops and delays, particularly when they are not properly timed. Such stops and delays contribute to significant amount of fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The recent development of connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technology provides new opportunities to enable better control of vehicles and intersections, that in turn reduces fuel consumption and emissions. In this paper, we propose a trajectory optimization method, PTO-GFC, to reduce the total fuel consumption of a CAV platoon through a signalized intersection. In this method, we first apply platoon-trajectory-optimization (PTO) to obtain the optimal trajectories of the platoon vehicles. In PTO, all CAVs in one platoon are considered as a whole, that is, all other CAVs follow the trajectory of the leading one with a time delay and minimum safety gap, which is enabled by vehicle to vehicle communication. Then, we apply gap-feedback-control (GFC) to control the vehicles with different speeds and headways merging into the optimal trajectories. We compare the PTO-GFC method with the other two methods, in which the leading vehicle adopts the optimal trajectory (LTO) or drive with maximum speed (AT), respectively, and the other vehicles follow the leading vehicle with a simplified Gipps’ car-following model. Furthermore, we extend the controls into multiple platoons by considering the interactions between the two platoons. The numerical results demonstrate that PTO-GFC has better performance than LTO and AT, particularly when CAVs have enough space and time to smooth their trajectories. The reduction of travel time and fuel consumption shows the great potential of CAV technology in reducing congestion and negative environmental impact of automobile transportation.}

Granular information on these aspects would allow measuring their valuation and/or addressing a pervasive source of endogeneity. Recent advances in miniaturization and data processing, as well as evidence that indicators from biosensors correlate with psychophysiological states and emotions, suggest that there is an opportunity to close this gap by collecting a new type of data from transportation users. This research works on leveraging this opportunity by putting forward, illustrating and testing a methodological framework to incorporate psychophysiological indicators gathered from biosensors into transportation choice behavioral modeling. The proposed framework adapts the integrated choice and latent variable approach by incorporating the psychophysiological responses as additional indicators of a latent psychophysiological state that covariates with utility. For the practical implementation of the proposed framework we also consider a specific form of aggregation of the indicators across time to avoid the curse of dimensionality arising from the unmanageably large number of folds for integration. The proposed framework is illustrated and validated using Monte Carlo simulations. Besides, a prototype field experiment was designed and performed to confirm the validity of three crucial components of the proposed framework: (i) the relation between transportation markers and emotions; (ii) the possibility of measuring those emotions through biosensors installed on travelers, (iii) and the validity of the proposed aggregation needed for practicality. In the experiment, a public transportation user travelled wearing a Printed Circuit Board that integrated tiny biosensors to capture electrodermal activity, heart rate variation, temperature and acceleration. Results provide positive evidence for the research questions, suggesting the convenience of developing larger data collection efforts in the future to take full advantage of the new framework.}

The model is mainly built upon the system dynamics of different families of vehicles in the neighborhood, which is governed by mass conservation equations utilizing the concept of macroscopic or network fundamental diagram (MFD or NFD). To reduce parking congestion and improve the overall system performance, two real-time parking pricing strategies are developed and integrated with the parking model: (i) a feedback-based reactive pricing strategy driven by the parking occupancy; and (ii) a model-based predictive or proactive pricing strategy that explicitly aims to minimize the expected aggregate cruising delay. Extensive numerical experiments have been conducted to compare the performance of the two strategies applied to both on- and off-street parking. The results provide new insights into how a parking system shall be better managed, with key implications for policy making summarized.}

A relationship between density and flow at the network level is developed and widely studied, namely the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD). Nevertheless, few empirical studies have been dedicated on the empirical evidence on the properties of the MFD for multiple modes of transport and to the best knowledge not yet at the scale of a megacity. This work combines rich, but incomplete data from multiple sources to investigate the vehicle and passenger MFDs for cars and buses in the road network of Shenzhen. A novel algorithm is proposed for partitioning bimodal network considering the homogeneous distribution of link-level car speeds and bus speeds. Furthermore, this paper sheds light on the passenger MFD for mixed car-bus networks. We propose an algorithm to estimate alighting passenger flow and passenger density on bus, by fusing smart card data (i.e. records for boarding passengers) and bus GPS data. We analyze the complexities of passenger flow and the impact of weather on traffic demand and bus occupancy. The results provide an empirical knowledge on multimodal traffic performance with respect to passenger flow. The existence of double hysteresis loops in bus passenger MFD is observed and the causes are explained by considering the influence of service operational features. The three-dimensional vehicle and passenger MFDs are also presented for revealing the complex dynamics characteristics of bimodal road network.}

abstract = {The use of smartphone applications (apps) to acquire real time and readily available journey planning information is becoming instinctive behavior by public transport (PT) users. Through the apps, a passenger not only seeks a path from origin to destination, but a satisfactory path that caters to the passenger’s preferences at the desired time of travel. Essentially, apps attempt to provide a means of personalized PT service. As the implications of the Covid-19 pandemic take form and infiltrate human and environmental interactions, passenger preference personalization will likely include avoiding risks of infection or contagious contact. The personal preferences are enabled by multiple attributes associated with alternative PT routes. For instance, preferences can be connected to attributes of time, cost, and convenience. This work establishes a personalized PT service, as an adjustment to current design frameworks, by integrating user app experience with operators’ data sources and operations modeling. The work proceeds to focus on its key component: the personalized route guidance methodology. In addition to using the existing shortest path or k-weighted shortest path method, this study develops a novel, lexicographical shortest path method, considering a just noticeable difference (JND). The method adopts lexicographical ordering to capture passenger preferences for different PT attributes following Ernst Weber’s law of human perception threshold. However, a direct application of Weber’s law violates the axiom of transitivity required for an implementable algorithm, and thus, a revised method is developed with proven algorithms for ranking different paths. The differences between the three route-guidance methods and the effects of the JND perception threshold on the order of the alternative PT routes are demonstrated with an example. The developments were examined in a case study by simulation on the Copenhagen PT network. The results show that using the JND method reduces the value/cost of the most important attributes. Identical robust results are attained when JND parameters are not specified and default values are used. The latter may apply for the future with a mixture of specified and default preference input values. Finally, the computation time indicates a favorable potential for real-life applications. It is believed that the consideration of human threshold perception will encourage decision makers to establish new criteria to comply with this.}

abstract = {The real-time crash risk analyses were proposed to establish the relationships between crash occurrence probability and pre-crash traffic operational conditions. Given its great application potentials that link with Active Traffic Management System (ATMS) for proactive safety management, it has become an important research area. Currently, researchers mainly developed the real-time crash risk analysis models with traffic flow descriptive statistics employed as explanatory variables and with re-sampled balanced dataset, which hold the limitations of insufficiently capturing the temporal-spatial traffic flow characteristics and failing to provide classification capabilities when deal with the imbalanced datasets. In this study, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) modelling approach with refined loss functions has been first time introduced to the real-time crash risk analyses. The primary objectives of the proposed CNN models are: (1) utilizing the tensor-based data structure to explore the multi-dimensional, temporal-spatial correlated pre-crash operational features; and (2) optimizing the loss functions to overcome the low classification accuracy issue brought by the imbalanced data. Data from the Shanghai urban expressway system were utilized for the empirical analysis. And a total of three types of loss functions, including traditional binary cross entropy, the α-weighted cross entropy and the focal loss, were introduced and being tested with varying ratios of crash and non-crash datasets. The modeling results show that the CNN model has better classification performance compared to the traditional Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP) model with the tensor-based structure data. Besides, the developed CNN model with focal loss function has substantial classification enhancement under the imbalanced datasets. Finally, thedistributions of predicting probabilities for balanced and imbalanced datasets were plotted to understand the effects of the imbalanced dataset and revealed how the proposed CNN model with focal loss function improves the model performance.}

Conventionally, vehicles are classified by size, the number of axles or engine types, e.g., standard passenger cars versus trucks. However, vehicle flow heterogeneity stems from many other aspects in general, e.g., ride-sourcing vehicles versus personal vehicles, human driven vehicles versus connected and automated vehicles. Provided with some observations of vehicular flow for each class in a large-scale transportation network, how to estimate the multi-class spatio-temporal vehicular flow, in terms of time-varying Origin-Destination (OD) demand and path/link flow, remains a big challenge. This paper presents a solution framework for multi-class dynamic OD demand estimation (MCDODE) in large-scale networks that work for any vehicular data in general. The proposed framework cast the standard OD estimation methods into a computational graph with tensor representations of spatio-temporal flow and all intermediate features involved in the MCDODE formulation. A forward-backward algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve the MCDODE formulation on computational graphs. In addition, we propose a novel concept of tree-based cumulative curves to compute the exact multi-class Dynamic Assignment Ratio (DAR) matrix. A Growing Tree algorithm is developed to construct tree-based cumulative curves. The proposed framework is examined on a small network, a mid-size network as well as a real-world large-scale network. The experiment results indicate that the proposed framework is compelling, satisfactory and computationally plausible.}

Many methods exist for medium- and short-term planning and analysis of railway capacity. Yet, there is a lack of methods for long term (strategic) planning that provides high quality estimates of capacity in complex railway networks. In this paper, we define capacity of a railway network by a maximal set of trains that can be operated in a predefined period. This maximal set distinguish between different train types and the number of each type, and thus the heterogeneity of the operation. We formalise the capacity determination as an optimisation problem with the objective of finding the maximal set of trains that minimises the average waiting time between trains of the same type. We test for feasibility of sets of trains by computing the time a set of trains occupies the infrastructure. A fixed timetable is not needed for the feasibility tests as samples of train sequences are examined. Furthermore, it is possible to determine a span of capacity depending on service constraints by adjusting input parameters. We propose and test two different solution approaches to determine the capacity of railway infrastructure: an exact branch-and-bound algorithm and a tabu search heuristic. The applicability of the capacity determination framework is demonstrated on the railway network of Southwestern Denmark, with and without infrastructure upgrades. We analyse computation time, solution performance and sensitivity. The results illustrate the ability to obtain quality solutions for a real network within the order of minutes. As precise infrastructure characteristics are considered in junctions, the method is able to quantify the effect of the infrastructure upgrades, contrary to other assessment methods used in the long term (strategic) planning phase.}

After estimation, it is common practice to use aggregate measurements to calibrate the estimated model-system’s parameters prior to their application in transportation planning, policy making, and operations. However, calibration of activity-based model-systems has received much less attention. Existing calibration approaches are myopic heuristics in the sense that they do not consider the fundamental inter-dependencies among choice-models and do not have a systematic way to adjust model parameters. Also, other purely simulation-based approaches do not perform well in large-scale applications. In this study, we focus on utility-maximizing nested logit activity-based model-systems and calibrating aggregate statistics such as activity shares, mode shares, time-dependent & mode-specific OD flows, and time-dependent & mode-specific sensor counts. We formulate the calibration problem as a simulation-based optimization problem and propose a stochastic gradient-based solution procedure to solve it. The solution procedure relies on microsimulation to calculate expectations of the aggregate statistics of interest to the calibration problem. Additionally, we derive approximate analytical expressions for the gradient of the objective function —that are evaluated through microsimulation on mini-batches of the population. The proposed solution procedure is sensitive to the fundamental structure of the activity-based model-system and is non-myopic in considering the dependencies across its model components. The formulated optimization problem is non-convex, highly nonlinear, and potentially has multiple-minima. Finally, we show —through a real-world application— that the proposed solution procedure outperforms other state-of-the-art purely simulation-based optimization approaches in terms of computational efficiency, stability, and convergence. We also compare various gradient-based solution algorithms to determine the best algorithm to update the parameters. This work has the potential to facilitate wider and easier application of activity-based model-systems.}

This paper aims to model the multi-driver repositioning task through a mean field multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that captures competition among multiple agents. Because the direct application of MARL to the multi-driver system under a given reward mechanism will likely yield a suboptimal equilibrium due to the selfishness of drivers, this study proposes a reward design scheme with which a more desired equilibrium can be reached. To effectively solve the bilevel optimization problem with upper level as the reward design and the lower level as a multi-agent system, a Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm is adopted to speed up the learning process. We then apply the bilevel optimization model to two case studies, namely, e-hailing driver repositioning under service charge and multiclass taxi driver repositioning under NYC congestion pricing. In the first case study, the model is validated by the agreement between the derived optimal control from BO and that from an analytical solution. With a simple piecewise linear service charge, the objective of the e-hailing platform can be increased by 8.4\%. In the second case study, an optimal toll charge of \$5.1 is solved using BO, which improves the objective of city planners by 7.9\%, compared to that without any toll charge. Under this optimal toll charge, the number of taxis in the NYC central business district is decreased, indicating a better traffic condition, without substantially increasing the crowdedness of the subway system.}

This framework relaxes assumptions in the literature by considering multiple origins and destinations, multiple access locations to the managed lane, en route diversion of travelers, partial observability of the sensor readings, and stochastic demand and observations. The problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and policy gradient methods are used to determine tolls as a function of real-time observations. Tolls are modeled as continuous and stochastic variables and are determined using a feedforward neural network. The method is compared against a feedback control method used for dynamic pricing. We show that Deep-RL is effective in learning toll policies for maximizing revenue, minimizing total system travel time, and other joint weighted objectives, when tested on real-world transportation networks. The Deep-RL toll policies outperform the feedback control heuristic for the revenue maximization objective by generating revenues up to 8.5\% higher than the heuristic and for the objective minimizing total system travel time (TSTT) by generating TSTT up to 8.4\% lower than the heuristic. We also propose reward shaping methods for the POMDP to overcome the undesired behavior of toll policies, like the jam-and-harvest behavior of revenue-maximizing policies. Additionally, we test transferability of the algorithm trained on one set of inputs for new input distributions and offer recommendations on real-time implementations of Deep-RL algorithms.

The dependence on the infrastructure and the increasing demand from these users press public transportation agencies for cost-effective sidewalk maintenance and better Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance. Unfortunately, most of the agencies still rely on outdated sidewalk mapping data or manual survey results for their sidewalk management. In this study, a network-level sidewalk inventory method is proposed by efficiently segmenting the mobile light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data using a customized deep neural network, i.e., PointNet++, and followed by integrating a stripe-based sidewalk extraction algorithm. By extracting the sidewalk locations from the mobile LiDAR point cloud, the corresponding geometry features, e.g., width, grade, cross slope, etc., can be extracted for the ADA compliance and the overall condition assessment. The experimental test conducted on the entire State Route 9, Massachusetts has shown promising performance in terms of the accuracy for the sidewalk extraction (i.e., point-level intersect over union (IoU) value of 0.946) and the efficiency for network analysis of the ADA compliance (i.e., approximately 6.5 min/mile). A case study conducted in Columbus District in Boston, Massachusetts, demonstrates that the proposed method can not only successfully support transportation agencies with an accurate and efficient means for network-level sidewalk inventory, but also support wheelchair users with accurate and comprehensive sidewalk inventory information for better navigation and route planning.}

This results in edges in the airport taxiway graph having multiple costs such as taxi time, fuel consumption and emissions. In such a graph, multiple edges exist between two nodes reflecting different trade-offs among the multiple costs. Aircraft will have to choose the most efficient edge from multiple edges in order to traverse from one node to another respecting various operational constraints. In this paper, we introduce a multi-objective routing and scheduling algorithm based on the enumerative approach that can be used to solve such a multi-objective multi-graph problem. Results using the proposed algorithm for a range of international airports are presented. Compared with other routing and scheduling algorithms, the proposed algorithm can find a representative set of optimal or near optimal solutions in a single run when the sequence of aircraft is fixed. In order to accelerate the search, heuristic functions and a preference-based approach are introduced. We analyse the performance of different approaches and discuss how the structure of the multi-graph affects computational complexity and quality of solutions.}

Image data are collected from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), and microscopic characteristics such as vehicle type, position, velocity, and trajectory are extracted through computer vision techniques. The Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier are utilized for the vehicle detection, while the Kalman Filter is employed for the derivation of vehicle trajectories. The Safety Space is then determined based on those trajectories. Validation data are collected at intersections in Taipei, Taiwan; Bangkok, Thailand; and Mumbai, India. The vehicle detection and tracking are satisfactory, and the Safety Space surrogate reveals risk zones caused by spatial proximity between vehicles.}

The sub-algorithm is based on a tailored Dijkstra shortest-path algorithm with introduction of the concept of impedance conduction for considering congestion along paths. The other sub-algorithm works in the low or microscopic level and is supposed to work with any chosen microscopic crowd dynamics model. It is mainly used to model dynamic changes of pedestrians’ departure doors while they are walking inside rooms. Many mechanisms are introduced for considering practical factors affecting pedestrians’ routing behaviors, for example consideration of congestion of segments between pedestrians and doors, consideration of impact of re-selection of previous doors, etc. According to conducted numerical experiments, the proposed algorithm can well model crowd’s tactical decisions in a microscopic simulation under various scenarios, thus is a suitable method for study of crowd dynamics in a complicated environment.}

Our ultimate goal is to be able to control trains such that they will arrive on-time, i.e. within the planned running time, regardless of uncertain factors affecting their dynamic or kinematic performance. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and solve it using a novel numerical approach which combines: (i) an off-line approximate dynamic programming (ADP) method to learn the energy and time costs over iterations, and (ii) an on-line search process to determine energy-efficient driving strategies that respect the real-time time windows, more in general expressed as train path envelope constraints. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we conducted a numerical study using real-life railway infrastructure and train data. Compared to a set of benchmark driving strategies, the trajectories from our ADP-based method reduce the probability of delayed arrival, and at the same time are able to better use the available running time for energy saving. Our results show that accounting for uncertainty is relevant when computing train trajectories and that our ADP-based method can handle this uncertainty effectively.}

Such stop-scale approaches ignore the fact that delays are also caused and perpetuated by network-wide factors (e.g., bottlenecks caused by shared tracks by multiple transit lines). The objective of this paper is to develop a network model and metrics that can quantify the delay dependencies between transit network stops, and identify local sources of network-wide issues. For this purpose, Bayesian network learning (at the intersection of machine learning and network science) was utilized. Based on the calculated Bayesian networks (BNs), network metrics (inducer and susceptible) were formulated to quantify the network-wide impacts of the delays experienced at the stops. To implement the proposed framework, the delays at Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) were gathered through a crowdsourced real-time transit information app called onTime. The developed BN model was tested through cross-validation, yielded promising accuracy results, successfully identified the problematic stops based on LIRR reports, and provided further insights on network impacts. The BN model and the developed metrics were further tested using a natural experiment, i.e., a before and after study focusing on a recently completed track expansion project at LIRR. The findings imply that BN learning can successfully identify the network dependencies and indicate the rail links/corridors that are the best candidate for subsequent improvement investments. Overall, the developed metrics can quantify the delay dependencies between stops and they can be used by policy makers and practitioners for investment and improvement decisions.}

Though a pain-point of the liner shipping industry, the container slot cancellation problem has not yet been well investigated in the literature. To fill this research gap, this study aims to estimate the probability for the cancellation of container slot booking in the long haul transports of the intercontinental liner shipping service by considering the primary influential factors of cancellation behavior. To achieve the objective, a container slot booking data-driven model is developed by means of a time-to-event modeling technique. To incorporate the effect of booking region on the cancellation probability, we introduce the frailty term in the model to capture the regionality of the container shipping market. Our case study with real slot booking data shows that the developed model performs well in forecasting the loaded containers of the slot booking requests. In addition, we shed light on how the internal factors of slot booking and external factors of shipping market influence the probability of cancellation.}

abstract = {With the advent of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), spatiotemporal traffic data has gained growing importance in real-time monitoring, prediction, and control of traffic. However, in practical implementations, data collection devices are often faced with malfunctions caused by various unpredictable disruptions, thereby resulting in the so-called “missing value problems.” In realistic cases, the disruptions to the data collection devices are often associated with some key events (e.g., power cut and natural disasters), in addition, along with other disruptions the missing value problem could be in a complicated manner with both randomly and completely missing patterns. To perform the imputation task with such complicated missing patterns, we propose a hybrid spatiotemporal method which utilizes the time series properties by “prophet” model and captures the spatial residuals information by iterative random forest model. The spatiotemporal method first applies the temporal part to fill the missing value and then adopts the spatial part to acquire the residual component of the missing values. The results of the two components are integrated into the final imputations. Based on the PeMS freeway dataset (PeMS, 2019) and an urban road dataset under extensive artificially designed scenarios like randomly, clustered non-completely and completely missing patterns, we test our proposed approach with some existing techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Seasonal-Trend decomposition using Loess (STL), Bayesian tensor decomposition, Denoising AutoEncoder (DAE). The test results indicate that the hybrid method achieves the best imputation quality for most missing patterns, particularly for those with completely or hybrid missing patterns. Furthermore, the hybrid model still performs well under extreme missing rates as high as 0.9, which validates the robustness of the model in extreme situations.}

Most data is kept private for many reasons, including commercial and security concerns. More than data, shared information is precious, as it leverages intelligent decision-making support tools designed to smoothen daily operations. We present a framework to detect, identify and characterise anomalies in past aircraft trajectory data. It is based on an open source of ADS-B based aircraft trajectories, and extracted information can benefit a wide range of stakeholders: Air Traffic Control (ATC) training centres could play more realistic simulations; ANSP may improve capacity indicators; academics improve safety models and risk estimations; and commercial stakeholders, like airlines and airports, may use such information to improve short-term predictions and optimise their operations. The technique is based on autoencoding artificial neural networks applied on flows of trajectories, which provide a useful reading grid associating cluster analysis with quantified level of abnormality. In particular, we find that the highest anomaly scores correspond to poor weather conditions, whereas anomalies with a lower score relate to ATC tactical actions.}

Speed heterogeneity (or aircraft mix) is recognized as a causal factor for complexity in air traffic operations, through qualitative or statistical analysis. Quantitative metrics on how it affects current and future Trajectory-Based Operation (TBO) is lacking, however. In this paper, we present an in-depth investigation of the impact of speed heterogeneity, by defining air traffic robustness at microscopic (aircraft pair) and macroscopic (air traffic flow) levels in nominal situations, derived mathematically and validated through fast-time computer simulations. A human-in-the-loop study follows investigating six 4D en route operation scenarios, where operators were instructed to resolve a large disturbance in a sector, using a novel interface. Results confirm the negative impact of speed heterogeneity on air traffic controller performance in terms of flow efficiency and workload. The mechanism of such impact is substantiated through analyzing several speed-based robustness metrics. Although the simulated traffic scenarios have similar baseline robustness, those with mixed speeds lead to significantly lower robustness and operational performance. This emphasizes the need to incorporate speed heterogeneity in robustness evaluations of air traffic control in current and future TBO environments.}

We found in this study that the Japanese consumers’ WTP is, on average, lower than the estimates for the US market and is not sufficient to enable autonomous vehicles (AVs) to capture a meaningful share of the existing car market. Second, compared with a previous study in the US, we propose and discuss an expected social dilemma caused by the ethical problems that AVs will face, known as the Trolley Problems. We find that social dilemma may occur because people tend not want to buy “moral” AVs. Third, we explored the determinants of the WTP and social dilemma to find that the credibility of AVs is determined to be a critical factor for the social dilemma.}

This research studies two particular problems in traffic forecasting: (1) capture the dynamic and non-local spatial correlation between traffic links and (2) model the dynamics of temporal dependency for accurate multiple steps ahead predictions. To address these issues, we propose a deep learning framework named Spatial-Temporal Sequence to Sequence model (STSeq2Seq). This model builds on sequence to sequence (seq2seq) architecture to capture temporal feature and relies on graph convolution for aggregating spatial information. Moreover, STSeq2Seq defines and constructs Pattern-aware Adjacency Matrix (PAM) based on pair-wise similarity of the recent traffic patterns on traffic links and integrates it into graph convolution operation. It also deploys a novel seq2sesq architecture which couples a convolutional encoder and a recurrent decoder with attention mechanism for dynamic modeling of long-range dependence between different time steps. We conduct extensive experiments using two publicly-available large-scale traffic datasets and compare STSeq2Seq with other baseline models. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance in terms of various error measures. The ablation study verifies the effectiveness of PAMs in capturing dynamic non-local spatial correlation and the superiority of proposed seq2seq architecture in modeling non-stationary temporal dependency for multiple steps ahead prediction. Furthermore, qualitative analysis is conducted on PAMs as well as the attention weights for model interpretation.}

This review of the extant literature provides a synthesized overview of the current state of knowledge, develops a meta-framework to reconcile past research, identifies inconsistencies in prior results, and suggests areas for future research. To address these future directions, this study empirically extends the proposed meta-framework by testing impactful new variables. Structural equation modelling of survey data from 992 respondents in Hungary shows that drivers of behavioural intention to use AVs significantly differ among users with high and with low personal information technology innovativeness. The behavioural intention of innovative users is influenced by utilitarian and hedonic motivations, whereas laggards are driven by hedonic motivation, and a utilitarian motivation does not play a role. Innovative users' behavioural intention to use AVs is affected by specific technological fears (i.e., data privacy concerns), whereas those lagging are not influenced by specific, only by general concerns (i.e., overall technological anxiety). The study also shows how individual-level behavioural intention to use AVs interacts with expected societal-level outcomes (e.g., equal opportunity for mobility). The results shed light on the need for more research on the role of moderating variables, which are relatively unexplored in the extant literature yet can contribute to a better understanding of the differences in patterns between various groups of future users, offering important managerial implications.}

Given that monitoring resources (e.g. loop detectors, probe vehicle data, etc.) are limited in real-world networks, acquiring adequate data to estimate an MFD is of crucial importance. This study presents a novel, network-wide approach to identifying critical links and estimating average traffic flow and density. The proposed model estimates the MFD using flow and density measurements from those critical links, which constitute only a small subset of all the links in the network. To find the critical links, we rely on historical probe vehicle data, and propose a model that builds on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a dimensionality reduction and a feature selection method. Essentially, using PCA, a large number of possibly interrelated variables in a dataset can be reduced to a set of smaller uncorrelated variables, while maintaining as much information as possible in the dataset. The resulting uncorrelated variables, or the principal components, indicate the major patterns or the dominating features of the original dataset. Additionally, PCA enables the (approximate) reconstruction of the full-scale dataset from the selected features (or principal components). In this work, we apply PCA in order to identify the main traffic features from a probe vehicle dataset; then, we find the links that are associated with these features (i.e., critical links); then, we locate loop detectors on those links to collect flow and density data; and finally, we reconstruct the full-scale data, building on the PCA mechanism. This gives us the flow and density of all links, from which we can effectively estimate the MFD.}

A multi-period line planning approach that considers a changing demand during the planning horizon is proposed. If such systems are also subject to limitations of resources, a dynamic transfer of resources from one line to another throughout the planning horizon should also be considered. A mathematical modelling framework is developed to solve the line planning problem with a cost-oriented approach considering transfer of resources during a finite length planning horizon of multiple periods. We use real-life public transportation network data for our computational results. We analyze whether or not multi-period solutions outperform single period solutions in terms of feasibility and relevant costs. The importance of demand variation on multi-period solutions is investigated. We evaluate the impact of resource transfer constraints on the effectiveness of solutions. We also study the effect of period lengths along with the problem parameters that are significant for and sensitive to the optimality of solutions.}

In order to effectively address the above issues, we propose the formulation and solution approach for a stochastic terminal FAADS problem under PBN environment. The proposed FAADS problem formulation combines the flexible 4-dimensional trajectory requirement under PBN environment and the stochastic quantifications both from the convective weather and flight arrival time uncertainties, which can finally make the FAADS results realize the avoidance of the convective weather and immunity of the flight arrival time variations within tolerable risk probabilities. We provide an efficient solution approach to tackle this problem with complex mixed integer and nonlinear programming basics and illustrate the capabilities of the solution approach by a test case on real terminal system in Shanghai Metroplex. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed problem formulation and solution approach.}

An understanding of these services (e.g. to whom, where, when, and for what purposes do they provide service?) is critical for regulating, planning, and managing urban multi-modal transportation systems effectively. Unfortunately, little is known about ridesourcing travel because private companies providing ridesourcing services were not previously subject to data sharing requirements. Fortunately, the city of Chicago recently collected and released spatially (census tract) and temporally (15-minute interval) aggregated data on ridesourcing trips collected from private companies. This study analyzes the Chicago ridesourcing data to examine factors influencing ridesourcing usage. The study employs a random-effects negative binomial (RENB) regression approach to model ridesourcing usage. Determinants considered in the model include weekend vs. weekday and weather variables as well as census tract socio-demographics and commute characteristics, land-use variables, places of interest, transit supply, parking features, and crime. The model results indicate ridesourcing demand is higher on days when temperatures are lower, there is less precipitation, and on the weekend, as well as in census tracts with (i) higher household incomes, (ii) a higher percentage of workers who carpool or take transit to work, (iii) a higher percentage of households with zero vehicles, (iv) higher population and employment density, (v) higher land-use diversity, (vi) fewer parking spots and higher parking rates, (vii) more restaurants, and (viii) more homicides. The results also demonstrate a non-linear (and insightful) relationship between ridesourcing demand and transit supply variables. The paper discusses the implications of these model results to inform transportation planning and policymaking as well as future research.}

To minimize the interference of drones on normal operations in the airports, a collision probability evaluation scheme based on collision-course trajectories modeling is proposed in this work. Firstly, a trajectory planning model of drones intruding restricted airspace is derived based on a given trajectory of the commercial aircraft (CA) and the collision-course scenario of the drone. Subsequently, according to the trajectories of the drone and CA, a probabilistic model based on the stochastic kinematic model is developed to implement the collision risk evaluation. The proposed method is first comparatively demonstrated with the Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation and several special cases with known drone’s trajectories. Subsequently, the cases covering different drone’s initial positions, positions updates, and different collision zones are simulated and analyzed using the proposed collision-course based model. The simulation results show that the established model can be employed to evaluate the collision probability, even if the trajectory information of the intruding drone is limited.}

abstract = {As app-based ride-hailing services have been widely adopted within existing traditional taxi markets, researchers have been devoted to understand the important factors that influence the demand of the new mobility. Econometric models (EMs) are mainly utilized to interpret the significant factors of the demand, and deep neural networks (DNNs) have been recently used to improve the forecasting performance by capturing complex patterns in the large datasets. However, to mitigate possible (induced) traffic congestion and balance utilization rates for the current taxi drivers, an effective strategy of proactively managing a quota system for both emerging services and regular taxis is still critically needed. This paper aims to systematically design an explainable deep learning model capable of assessing the quota system balancing the demand volumes between two modes. A two-stage interpretable machine learning modeling framework was developed by a linear regression (LR) model, coupled with a neural network layered by long short-term memory (LSTM). The first stage investigates the correlation between the existing taxis and on-demand ride-hailing services while controlling for other explanatory variables. The second stage fulfills the long short-term memory (LSTM) network structure, capturing the residuals from the first estimation stage in order to enhance the forecasting performance. The proposed stepwise modeling approach (LR-LSTM) forecasts the demand of taxi rides, and it is implemented in the application of pick-up demand prediction using New York City (NYC) taxi data. The experiment result indicates that the integrated model can capture the inter-relationships between existing taxis and ride-hailing services as well as identify the influence of additional factors, namely, the day of the week, weather, and holidays. Overall, this modeling approach can be applied to construct an effective active demand management (ADM) for the short-term period as well as a quota control strategy between on-demand ride-hailing services and traditional taxis.}

Even with the recent development of battery technologies, a lack of charging stations and range anxiety are still significant concerns, specifically for intercity trips. This calls for more investments in building charging stations and advancing battery technologies to increase the market share of electric vehicles and improve sustainability. This study suggests a configuration for plug-in electric vehicle charging infrastructure to support long-distance intercity trips of electric vehicles at the network level. A model is proposed to minimize the total system cost including infrastructure investment (building charging stations/spots) and travel time delays (charging time, waiting time in the queue, and detour time to access charging stations). This study fills existing gaps in the literature by capturing realistic patterns of travel demand and considering flow-dependent charging delays at charging stations. Furthermore, the proposed model, which is formulated as a mixed-integer program with nonlinear constraints, solves the optimization problem at the network level. At the network level, impacts of charging station locations on the traffic assignment problem with a mixed fleet of electric and conventional vehicles need to be considered. To this end, a traffic assignment module is integrated with a simulated annealing algorithm. The numerical experiments show a satisfactory application of the model for a full-scale case study (intercity network in Michigan). The solution quality and efficiency of the proposed solution algorithm are evaluated against those of an enumeration approach for a small case study. The results suggest that even for the current market share and charging stations’ setting, a significant investment is needed to support intercity trips without range anxiety issues and with acceptable delays. Furthermore, through sensitivity analyses, the required infrastructure and battery investments to support intercity trips with acceptable delays are established for hypothetical increased market shares and battery size in the future.}

For privately-owned AVs, such empty repositioning has the potential benefit of avoiding parking costs at their destination. AV owners could have their vehicle drop them off at their destination, then drive elsewhere to park. Although previous studies have considered the congestion effects of AVs repositioning to park at their owner’s residence, this study models the choice of parking location when AVs reposition away from the traveler’s destination. We model this behavior through a modified static traffic assignment with a logit model for destination choice, in which AV passenger-carrying trips can create a second empty repositioning trip to an alternate parking zone. The traffic assignment is formulated as a variational inequality. Numerical results on the Chicago sketch network show the effects of AV market penetration, fuel costs, and parking fees on the number of repositioning trips, as well as the impacts of repositioning trips on network congestion. Next, we study the problem of adjusting zone-specific parking costs to influence the repositioning behavior. In particular, when zones have asymmetric parking infrastructure costs, optimized parking fees combined with empty repositioning can encourage AVs to park at cheaper locations, thus reducing the land used for parking at zones with high land value. This network design problem is formulated as a bi-level program. Since it is bi-level and non-convex, a genetic algorithm is used to find a good solution. Results on the Sioux Falls test network show that the adjusted parking costs are effective at reducing the congestion caused by empty repositioning and encouraging more optimal parking choices for repositioning AVs.}

In the concept, a platoon is referred to as a “Vessel Train” (VT). A VT is composed of a fully manned lead vessel and a number of follower vessels. The lead vessel takes over the navigational and situational awareness responsibilities for the follower vessels (FVs). This enables automation of the navigational tasks on these follower vessels, which in turn leads to a potential reduction in crew size and associated cost. This paper describes the economic viability of the VT concept. It is applied to a short sea case study in which a fully matured system and an early implementation stage are mimicked. The assessment shows that viability is strongly influenced by the number of crew members removed from the FVs and the departure intervals of consecutive trains. It concludes that while economically viable cases can indeed be identified, the benefits created by this VT implementation are present but not very large. This is making it questionable if a successful application of the concept can be achieved given the risk and uncertainty surrounding the individual parameters.}

Researchers have examined AVs and their potential impacts with two methods: (1) survey-based studies of AV preferences and (2) simulation-based estimation of secondary impacts of varied AV deployment strategies, such as Shared AVs (SAVs) and Privately-owned AVs (PAVs). While the preference survey literature can inform AV simulation studies, preference study results have so far not been integrated into simulation-based research. This lack of integration stems from the absence of data that measure preferences towards PAVs and SAVs at the neighborhood level. Existing preference studies usually investigate adoption likelihood without collecting appropriate information to link preferences to precise locations or neighborhoods. This study develops a microsimulation approach, incorporating machine learning and population synthesizing, to fill this data gap, leveraging a national AV perception survey (NAVPS) and the latest National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data. The model is applied to San Francisco, CA, and Austin, TX, to test the concept. We validate the proposed model by comparing the spatial distributions of synthesized ride-hailing users and observed ride-hailing trips. High correlations between our synthesized user density and empirical trip distributions in two study areas, to some extent, verify our proposed modeling approach.}

abstract = {This study aims to model two-dimensional (lateral and longitudinal) motion of an Ego Vehicle (EV). Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) is enhanced for this purpose. All the surrounding obstacles (vehicles and road boundaries) are considered as stimuli that elicit driver’s reactions (lateral and longitudinal accelerations). A Virtual LiDAR sensor on the EV perceives the surrounding. Proximity and speed are used to compute longitudinal and lateral components of average relative velocity. A new formulation is presented to compute the effective gap considering all the surrounding obstacles. It is composed of four components: front, rear, left, and right. The former two affect longitudinal acceleration, while the latter two influence lateral acceleration of the EV. A discretionary lane-change model is also developed to account for the driver’s deliberate (not just mandatory) lateral movements. A total of 13 model parameters are used, of which eight are newly introduced. These model parameters are calibrated using 1050 human-driven car trajectories from Next Generation SIMulation dataset. Taguchi’s fractional factorial design principle is used to optimize the parameters. Gray relational analysis indicated that the three newly introduced parameters to be the three most influential parameters. Validation using another 450 car trajectories resulted in a mean radial error of 3.97 m over a horizon of 10 s. The performance measures of two-dimensional motion planning (model error, longitudinal error, and mixed gap error) are found to be better than those reported in the literature. The developed human-like AV-IDM offers a proof of concept.}

abstract = {Connected and automated technologies for vehicles pave the way for major changes in traffic control methodology. A decentralized control system based on a communication network using vehicle-to-vehicle communications and each vehicle’s on-board controller will be one of the predominant approaches to vehicle trajectory optimization when the deployment of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) has advanced, because of its scalability and fault resistance compared to the centralized system. In this study, we propose a dynamic game-based vehicle trajectory optimization approach that can be utilized in a decentralized control system based on CAV technologies for merging segments, which is one of the bottlenecks of highways. Since the decentralized system is constructed by equal individual vehicles that decide their own optimal control in conflicting situations, we introduce a game-theory-based approach for obtaining a satisfactory result for those vehicles. Further, for achieving the optimal result at the end of the target segment, we employ a dynamic game to design the whole interrelated time-series trajectories of competing pairs of vehicles. To tackle the curse of dimensionality, we use an efficient method to enumerate the sets of combinations – a zero-suppressed binary decision diagram (ZDD) – and propose an algorithm that uses this ZDD to solve the dynamic game. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated via numerical experiments, and is compared to a static game-based model and an individual dynamic decision model. The results prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach—it induces efficiently adjusted behaviors of competing vehicles and enables merging success, especially in a situation where the initial gaps between vehicles are not enough for immediate lane change, which is achieved by the combined effect of the game-theoretic approach and the dynamic decision approach.}

The paper studies cooperative decision-making for mixed traffic (CDMMT). Using discrete optimization, a CDMMT mechanism is developed to facilitate ramp merging, and to properly capture the cooperative and non-cooperative behaviors in mixed traffic. The CDMMT mechanism can be described as a bi-level optimization program in which state-constrained optimal control-based trajectory design problems are imbedded in a sequencing problem. A bi-level dynamic programming-based solution approach is developed to efficiently solve the problem. The proposed modeling mechanism and solution approach are generic to deterministic decisions and can guarantee system-efficient solutions. A micro-simulation environment is built for model validation and analysis of mixed traffic. The results show that compared to the scenario with 100\% HVs, ramp-merging can be smoother in mixed traffic environment. At high CAV penetration, the section throughput increases about 18\%. With the proposed CDMMT mechanism, traffic throughput can be further increased by 10–15\%. The proposed methods form the basis of traffic analysis and cooperative control at ramp-merging sections under mixed traffic environment.}

We apply a serious game – PARKGAME – to understand and model drivers' two intertwined instantaneous parking choices: when to quit cruising and where to cruise. Forty-nine participants took part in a lab experiment in which they had to arrive on time to a fictional appointment or face monetary penalties, and had to choose between uncertain but cheap on-street parking or a certain but costly parking lot. Scenarios diverged on the time to appointment and distance between the meeting place and parking lot locations. Participants played a series of 8 or 16 computer games on a Manhattan grid road network with high on-street parking occupancy and a nearby parking lot of unlimited capacity. Players’ parking choices were analyzed with accelerated-failure time (AFT) and multinomial logistic regression models. Results show that drivers are mostly myopic and risk-averse, and quit their on-street parking search long before the optimal moment. Spatially, drivers are attracted by the lot-destination axis, and their turn choices at junctions comply with a second-order biased random walk. The implications of game-based methods for simulation model development and sustainable parking policy are further discussed.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a new class of extreme value distribution called compound generalized extreme value (CGEV) distribution for investigating the effects of monthly and seasonal variation on extreme travel delays in road networks. Since the frequency and severity of extreme events are highly correlated to the variation in weather conditions as an extrinsic cause of incidents and long delays, monthly and seasonal changes in weather contributes to extreme travel time variability. The change in driving behavior, which itself varies according to road/weather conditions, also contributes to the monthly and seasonal variation in observed extreme travel times. Therefore, it is critical to model the effect of monthly and seasonal changes on observed extreme travel delays on road networks. Based on the empirically revealed linear relationship between mean and standard deviation (SD) of extreme travel delays for both monthly and seasonal levels, two multiplicative error models are formulated. The CGEV distribution is then obtained by linking the two multiplicative error models and forming a compound distribution that characterizes the overall variation in extreme travel delay. The CGEV distribution parameters are calibrated and the underlying assumptions that are used to derive the CGEV distribution are validated using multi-year observed travel time data from the City of Calgary road network. The results indicate that accounting for the seasonality by identifying seasonal specific parameters provides a flexible and not too complex CGEV distribution that is shown to outperform the traditional GEV distribution. Finally, the application of the proposed CGEV distribution is evaluated in the context of road network vulnerability taking into account the observed probability of extreme event occurrences and the link importance. This derived data-driven vulnerability index incorporates a wealth of information related to both network topography in terms of connectivity and the dynamic interaction between travel demand and supply. This new data-driven vulnerability measure can thus be used as a decision support tool to inform decision-makers in prioritizing improvements to critical links to enhance overall network vulnerability, reliability, and resilience.}

We are not aware of any TMS estimation method that can remedy this situation or support relevant applications in real time. This research proposes a quasi-real time algorithm for estimating TMS, which includes triggering movement as well as duration estimation. The proposed method is based on data for connected vehicles (CVs), including their trajectories and their desired turning directions. In addition, a model that uses partial trajectory data is proposed. For each assumed TMS, a “simplified trajectory” is developed by the construction of a piece-wise linear curve. To minimize any deviation of the simplified trajectory from observation, a TMS estimation can be made. This proposed method is effective and computationally efficient when tested against dynamic demand in two mainstream signal phase settings, with varied sample sizes. Even though data for a higher number of vehicle samples is generally favorable, the proposed model still makes a good estimate when only one trajectory is available.}

We dissect our controller into two parts: 1. the unconnected mode, active when following a human-driven vehicle, and 2. the connected mode, active when following another automated vehicle equipped with connectivity. Probabilistic constraints balance safety considerations with inter-vehicle compactness, and vehicle constraints for acceleration capabilities are expressed through the use of powertrain maps. Emergent highway traffic scenarios are then modeled using time headway distributions from empirical traffic data. To study the impact of automation over a range of demands of free-flow to stop-and-go, we vary vehicle flux from low to high and vary automated vehicle penetration from low to high. When examining all-human driving scenarios, network capacity failed to meet demand in high-volume scenarios, such as rush-hour traffic. We further find that with connected automated vehicles introduced, network capacity was improved to support the high-volume scenarios. Finally, we examine energy efficiencies of the fleet for conventional, electric, and hybrid vehicles. We find that automated vehicles perform at a 10\%–20\% higher energy efficiency over human drivers when considering conventional powertrains, and find that automated vehicles perform at a 3\%–9\% higher energy efficiency over human drivers when considering electric and hybrid powertrains. Due to secondary effects of smoothing traffic flow and reducing unnecessary braking, energy benefits also apply to human-driven vehicles that interact with automated ones. Such simulated humans were found to drive up to 10\% more energy-efficiently than they did in the baseline all-human scenario.}

However, little is known about the acceptance of shared parking by consumers of a different socio-demographic profile. To understand the feasibility and potential success of shared parking, this paper develops a stated choice experiment with three choice options: fixed mode shared parking, flexible mode shared parking and not interested, to investigate parking space owners’ propensity to engage in shared parking under varying conditions. Because the demand for shared parking is uncertain, the revenues owners may generate are uncertain. As one of the most popular theories of decision making under uncertainty, the cumulative prospect theory is incorporated into a multinomial logit model to capture the decision problem in which some variables are uncertain and others are not. The revenue that owners expect shared parking can bring is used as the reference point to differentiate between gains and losses. Gains refer to outcomes that exceed the reference point, while losses refer to outcomes that fall short. To examine unobserved heterogeneity, a random parameter version of the model is specified to estimate the distribution of decision weights across the sample. Results show that socio-demographic characteristics, context variables, revenues and psychological concerns are all important factors in explaining parking space owners’ propensity to engage in platform-based shared parking schemes. Incorporating unobserved heterogeneous improves the overall goodness-of-fit of the model. Understanding parking space owners’ propensity to share their parking spaces in relation to their psychological concerns and uncertain conditions is critical to improve shared parking policies. The results of this paper may help designers and planners in the delivery of shared parking services and promote the success and future growth of the shared parking industry.}

abstract = {Accurate information of path followed by vehicles at several real-life scenarios is essential for modeling and testing the optimal path for autonomous vehicles, analyzing the lateral dynamics such as lane-changing and overtaking, vehicle dynamics at the horizontal curves, intersections, and roundabouts. Recently, the availability of such data is plenty, thanks to the advancements in drone and computer-vision technologies. Nevertheless, extracting useful information from the observed data requires certain pre-processing that can handle the noises added at several stages of the data collection. The adequacy of the existing off-the-shelf smoothing techniques (e.g., Moving average, Savitzky–Golay, Kalman filter) for denoising the trajectory data of the modern era is certainly a question. The motivation for the present study is twofold. Firstly, the challenges of contemporary trajectory data collection and associated error patterns are relatively unknown, and thus an appropriate denoising technique needs to be developed. Secondly, many of the existing smoothing techniques have chosen invariant parameters across all the vehicle paths, even though the error patterns are dissimilar across the vehicles and, in the longitudinal and lateral directions. Thus, an adaptive smoothing needs to be applied for each observed vehicle path and its components. The present study proposes an adaptive, and data-driven path smoothing technique that can be universally applied to the video-based path data obtained from any camera platform (either drone or fixed camera setup). The proposed reconstruction framework works in three-stages; in the first stage, the data is prepared by resampling any missing data. Also, any outlier in the observed path data is identified and removed at this stage. In the second stage, a Recursively Ensembled Low-Pass (RELP) filter is proposed to handle the ’heavily tailed’ noise found in the video-processing based trajectory data, particularly for drone videos. A robust adaptive Gaussian kernel smoothing is applied in the third stage to have a localized reconstruction. For Kernel smoothing, the smoothing parameters such as the optimal bandwidth and polynomial order are estimated using the proposed grid-search algorithm. The parameter estimation process ensures that the bias and variance are perfectly traded-off to achieve a smooth vehicle path. The performance evaluation of the proposed method shows an internally and physically consistent trajectory reconstruction.}

However, finding the globally optimal solution of the repair and work zone policy for a large-scale pavement network along a long-term planning horizon can be computationally cumbersome. In this study, as a benchmark, we first propose an exact solution algorithm based on dynamic programming. Then we second propose a computationally feasible methodology, a time-invariant simplified rule, to determine desirable (near-optimal) policies. The proposed methodology is applied to two numerical studies: (i) Case 1 for a small-scale road pavement system to compare life cycle costs and computational times between the rule-based methodology and the exact solution algorithm, and (ii) Case 2 for a real-scale road pavement system to discuss the effectiveness of the rule-based methodology. In Case 1, the rule-based methodology derives a near-optimal solution with a significantly shorter computational time than the exact solution algorithm. Case 2 shows that the rule-based methodology can find a superior policy to the aggregation of the optimal solutions independently found for each of decomposed sub-systems in a feasible computational time. Through sensitivity analyses, we find that the repair and work zone policies should vary depending on the deterioration process, cost factors, and weight between agency and user costs for society’s view or available budget for the agency’s perspective.}

In existing truck-and-UAV delivery models that assume constant or unlimited UAV endurance, the natural conclusion is that operating UAVs at higher speeds will either decrease, or have no adverse effect on, total delivery times. However, in reality, UAV power consumption is a nonlinear function of both speed and parcel weight; flying at high speeds can dramatically reduce flight ranges, thus limiting the effectiveness of these logistics systems. This paper addresses the tradeoffs between speed and range in a new variant of the combined truck/UAV delivery problem in which UAV speeds are treated as decision variables. A three-phased algorithm is provided that dynamically adjusts UAV speeds to achieve superior performance, with the goal of minimizing the total delivery time (or makespan). Results indicate that significant time savings can be achieved by operating UAVs at variable speeds. Furthermore, under certain conditions, optimizing UAV speeds also results in shorter truck travel distances, reduced UAV energy consumption per trip, and less UAV loitering while waiting to rendezvous with the truck.}

To investigate the extent to which real-world households utilize this flexibility, we used from 20 two-car households in the Gothenburg area in Sweden, GPS data from before and during an EV trial in which the households were asked to temporarily replace one of their two conventional cars with a short-range EV for the duration of the trial. The actual household electric drive fraction, i.e., the EV distance as a share of the total two-car household driving distance varied between 30 and 70\%, with a household mean of 47\%. On average, this corresponds to 80\% of the estimated potential household electric drive fraction during the trial. We quantify the flexibility in choosing the EV as the difference in distance between the potential, and the minimum needed, EV driving. For below-range (≤120 km) home-to-home non-overlapping trips, the households used 69\% of that flexibility. For household trips that did overlap in time, they used 56\% of the flexibility. Thus, the EV is the preferred vehicle, but the preference is less obvious for overlapping trips. Our analysis implies an even more dominant role for the EV in weekend driving. Further, although the pre-trial data showed a large difference in the household shares of distances driven between a (later in the EV trial) replaced “first” car and a replaced “second” car, this difference disappears when an EV replaces either one.}

When the number of attributes describing the agents and/or their level of detail becomes large, survey data cannot densely support the joint distribution of the attributes in the population due to the curse of dimensionality. It leads to a situation where many attribute combinations are missing from the sample data while such combinations exist in the real population. In this case, it becomes essential to consider methods that are able to impute such missing information effectively. In this paper, we propose to use deep generative latent models. These models are able to learn a compressed representation of the data space, which when projected back to the original space, leads to an effective way of imputing information in the observed data space. Specifically, we employ the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) and the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for a large-scale population synthesis application. The models are applied to a Danish travel survey with a feature-space of more than 60 variables and trained and tested using cross-validation. A new metric that applies to the evaluation of generative models in an unsupervised setting is proposed. It is based on the ability to generate diverse yet valid synthetic attribute combinations by comparing if the models can recover missing combinations (sampling zeros) while keeping truly impossible combinations (structural zeros) models at a minimum. For a low-dimensional experiment, the VAE, the marginal sampler and the fully random sampler generate 5\%, 21\% and 26\% more structural zeros per sampling zero when compared to the WGAN. For a high dimensional case, these figures increase to 44\%, 2217\% and 170440\% respectively. This research directly supports the development of agent-based systems and in particular cases where detailed socio-economic or geographical representations are required.}

abstract = {Road traffic congestion is the result of various phenomena often of random nature and not directly observable with empirical experiments. This makes it difficult to clearly understand the empirically observed traffic instabilities. The vehicles’ acceleration/deceleration patterns are known to trigger instabilities in the traffic flow under congestion. It has been empirically observed that free-flow pockets or voids may arise when there is a difference in the speeds and the spacing between the follower and the leader increases. During these moments, the trajectory is dictated mainly by the characteristics of the vehicle and the behaviour of the driver and not by the interactions with the leader. Voids have been identified as triggers for instabilities in both macro and micro level, which influence traffic externalities such as fuel consumption and emissions. In the literature, such behaviour is usually reproduced by injecting noise to the results of car-following models in order to create fluctuations in the instantaneous vehicles’ acceleration. This paper proposes a novel car-following approach that takes as input the driver and the vehicle characteristics and explicitly reproduces the impact of the vehicle dynamics and the driver’s behaviour by adopting the Microsimulation Free-flow aCceleration (MFC) model. The congested part of the model corresponds to the Lagrangian discretization of the LWR model and guarantees a full consistency at the macroscopic scale with congested waves propagating accordingly to the first-order traffic flow theory. By introducing naturalistic variation in the driving styles (timid and aggressive drivers) and the vehicle characteristics (specification from different vehicle models), the proposed model can reproduce realistic traffic flow oscillations, similar to those observed empirically. An advantage of the proposed model is that it does not require the injection of any noise in the instantaneous vehicle accelerations. The proposed methodology has been tested by studying a) the traffic flow oscillations produced by the model in a one-lane road uphill simulation scenario, b) the ability of the model to reproduce car-following instabilities observed in three car-following trajectory datasets and c) the ability of the model to produce realistic fuel consumption estimates. The results prove the robustness of the proposed model and the ability to describe traffic flow oscillations as a consequence of the combination of driving style and vehicle’s technical specifications.}

abstract = {Existing fixed-time traffic signal optimization methods mainly use traffic volumes collected by infrastructure-based detectors (e.g., loop detectors). These infrastructure-based detectors generally have high maintenance costs and low coverage. With the deployment of probe vehicles, vehicle trajectory data provide more information about traffic states and can be utilized for signal timing. However, most related studies assume high penetration rates of probe vehicles or short sampling intervals. This paper develops a hierarchical multi-objective optimization framework to optimize fixed-time traffic signals based on sampled vehicle trajectories at isolated signalized intersections, which is applicable to low-resolution trajectory data. Cycle length and green splits are optimized under both under- and slightly over-saturated traffic conditions. The number of over-saturated phases and average vehicle delays are adopted as the primary and the secondary objectives, respectively. Note that the queues of over-saturated phases cannot be discharged. The queue length and traffic delay of over-saturated phases will go infinite as time goes. The consideration of the over-saturated phase number helps increase vehicle throughput and reduce queue length and traffic delay. The aggregation of sampled trajectory data during the same period across multiple cycles and Same-ratio Principles (SRPs) are proposed to compensate for the limitations of low penetration rates of probe vehicles. The evolution of sampled trajectories with varying signal timings are formulated explicitly. A sampled-trajectory-density method is proposed to identify over-saturated phases. Then a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model is formulated and transformed to a series of mixed integer linear programming (MILP) models by linearization and enumerating cycle lengths. Simulation studies validate the advantages of the proposed model over the one in Synchro Studio. Sensitivity analysis shows that: (1) the proposed model is applicable to Poisson vehicle arrivals; (2) the proposed model can handle sampling intervals as long as 15 s when sufficient sampled vehicle trajectories are collected; (3) the number of sampled trajectories has impacts on the performance of the proposed model instead of probe vehicle penetration rates, especially with under-saturated traffic; (4) cycle lengths of initial signal timing plans have no noticeable impacts on the required number of sampled trajectories when a short sampling interval is applied; and (5) the proposed model is insensitive to the quality of initial signal timing plans with under- and slightly over-saturated traffic. The proposed model is also implemented with field data to demonstrate its applicability in the real world.}

abstract = {Max-pressure traffic signal control has many desirable properties. It is analytically proven to maximize network throughput if demand could be served by any signal control. Despite its network-level stability properties, the control itself is decentralized and therefore easily computed by individual intersection controllers. Discussions with city engineers have suggested that a major barrier to implementation in practice is the non-cyclical phase actuation of max-pressure control, which can actuate any phase, in arbitrary order, to serve the queue(s) with highest pressure. This arbitrary phase selection may be confusing to travelers expecting a signal cycle, and is therefore unacceptable to some city traffic engineers. This paper revises the original max-pressure control to include a signal cycle constraint. The max-pressure control must actuate an exogenous set of phases in order, with each phase actuated at least one time step per cycle. Each cycle has a maximum length, but the length can be reduced if desired. Within those constraints, we define a modified max-pressure control and prove its maximum stability property. The revised max-pressure control takes the form of a model predictive control with a one cycle lookahead, but we prove that the optimal solution can be easily found by enumerating over phases. The policy is still decentralized. Numerical results show that as expected, the cyclical max-pressure control performs slightly worse than the original max-pressure control due to the additional constraints, but with the advantage of greater palatability for implementation in practice.}

Since the seq2seq architecture has the advantage of handling variable lengths of input and output sequences, in this paper, it is applied to car-following behavior modeling to memorize historical information and make multi-step predictions. We further compare the seq2seq model with a classical car-following model (IDM) and a deep learning car-following model (LSTM). The evaluation results indicate that the proposed model outperforms others for reproducing trajectory and capturing heterogeneous driving behaviors. Moreover, the platoon simulation demonstrates that the proposed model can well reproduce different levels of hysteresis phenomenon. The proposed model is further extended with spatial anticipation, which improves platoon simulation accuracy and traffic flow stability.}

This paper is novel in extending the application of BNs to daily activity tours. Results show that BNs can synthesise both activity and trip chain structures accurately.

Due to safety concerns, most existing studies prohibit lane change since this may cause lateral collisions when coordination is not appropriately performed. However, in many traffic scenarios (e.g., work zones), vehicles must change lanes. To solve this problem, we categorize the potential collision into two kinds and thus establish a bi-level planning problem. The right-of-way of vehicles for the critical conflict zone is considered in the upper-level, and the right-of-way of vehicles during lane changes is then resolved in the lower-level. The solutions of the upper-level problem are represented in tree space, and a near-optimal solution is searched for by combining Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with some heuristic rules within a very short planning time. The proposed strategy is suitable for not only the shortest delay objective but also other objectives (e.g., energy-saving). Numerical examples show that the proposed strategy leads to good traffic performance in real-time.}

A P2P ridesharing system provides a platform to match a group of drivers, who use their personal vehicles to travel, with their peer riders who are in need of transportation. P2P ridesharing systems are traditionally categorized as two-side markets, with two mutually exclusive sets of agents, i.e., riders and drivers. Fixing the roles of participants a priori, however, could come at an opportunity cost of missed social welfare/revenue for the system. Consequently, this paper proposes a new market game, and its corresponding mathematical formulation, that outputs matching, role assignment, and pricing. We investigate the stability properties of this market game, and present a mathematical formulation that yields a stable outcome if one exists. Furthermore, we propose a Lagrangian relaxation algorithm to obtain a stable solution for large-scale games with empty cores through subsidizing the system. Using numerical experiments, we demonstrate the benefits of the proposed methodology, and its advantages over previously proposed methods for stabilizing non-bipartite graphs.}

abstract = {Lane-changing is one of the complex driving tasks that depends on the number of vehicles, objectives, and lanes. A driver often needs to respond to a lane-changing request of a lane-changer, which is a function of their personality traits and the current driving conditions. A connected environment is expected to assist during the lane-changing decision-making process by increasing situational awareness of surrounding traffic through vehicle-to-vehicle communication and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. Although the majority of lane-changing decision-making components (e.g., gap acceptance behaviour, lane-changing execution behaviour, and drivers’ response to a heavy vehicle) in a traditional environment (an environment without driving aids) has been frequently investigated, our understanding of drivers’ interactions during the lane-changing decision-making process in a connected environment remains elusive due to the novelty of a connected environment and the scarcity of relevant data. As such, this study examines drivers’ responses to lane-changing requests in a connected environment using the CARRS-Q Advanced Driving Simulator. Seventy-eight participants responded to the lane-changing request of a lane-changer under two randomised driving conditions: baseline (traditional environment without driving aids) and connected environment (with driving aids). A segmentation-based approach is employed to extract drivers’ responses to the lane-changing request and subsequently estimate their response time from trajectory data. Additionally, drivers’ response times are modelled using a random parameter accelerated failure time (AFT) hazard-based duration model. Results reveal that drivers tend to be more cooperative in response to a lane-changing request in the connected environment compared with the baseline condition whereby they tend to accelerate to avoid the lane-changing request. The AFT model suggests that on average drivers’ response times are shorter in the connected environment, implying that drivers respond to the lane-changing request faster in the presence of driving aids. However, at the individual level, connected environment’s impact on drivers’ response times is mixed as drivers’ response times may increase or decrease in the connected environment compared to the baseline condition, for instance, we find that female drivers have lower response times in the connected environment than that of male drivers. Overall, this study finds that drivers in connected environment, on average, take less time to respond and appear to be more cooperative, and thus, are less likely to be engaged in safety–critical events.}

However, in the era of autonomous vehicles (AVs) with parking autonomy, there are more alternative parking options available as AV can park at more distant locations away from the trip maker’s destination. This paper aims to investigate the morning commute problem with consideration of AV commuters’ distant parking choices in a many-to-one network. Parking sharing scheme is explicitly considered, wherein AV travellers can choose to park at city centre at public parking facilities and then lease their own parking space out, park at home, or park at a shared parking space. We first examine how AV commuters in different residential clusters prioritize their parking location choices, as well as their willingness to share the vacant parking space. Then, we investigate the travellers’ trip timing decisions and determine the resultant equilibrium travel pattern. Without other dynamic managing schemes, the model results indicate that appropriate CBD parking supply, together with differentiated parking charges/subsidy, can reduce the total queueing congestion significantly, yet at the cost of higher total travel cost.}

Detailed queuing evolution and spillback across adjacent intersections are considered. According to shockwave analysis, the analytical probability distribution of individual vehicle’s travel time is derived based on different initial conditions. This probability distribution is parameterized by the fundamental diagram (FD) parameters, traffic volume, and cycle state (queue length). A three-layer recursive BN model is then proposed to construct the state evolution process as well as the relationships between traffic volume, cycle state, FD parameters, sampled vehicles’ arrival times and intersection travel times. As traffic volume and initial queue cannot be measured directly from sampled trajectory data, the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm and particle filtering (PF) are introduced to solve this recursive BN model. By shockwave analysis, such estimated traffic parameters are then used to estimate the maximum queue length and traffic volume of each cycle. The proposed method is evaluated using microscopic traffic simulation data as well as empirical data. Numerical results show that the proposed method achieves promising accuracy even under low penetration rates, with the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the estimation bounded by 15\% and generally around 10\%.}

abstract = {In recent years, due to the increased availability of data and improvements in computing power, application of machine learning techniques to various aviation safety problems for identifying, isolating, and reducing risk has gained momentum. Data collected from on-board recorders in commercial aircraft contain thousands of parameters in the form of multivariate time-series (continuous, discrete, categorical, etc.) which are used to train the machine learning models. Among the phases of flight, approach and landing phases result in the most accidents and incidents. The performance and trajectory of the aircraft during the approach phase is an indicator of its landing performance which, in turn, affects incident or accident probability such as runway excursions. Landing performance is commonly measured using metrics such as landing airspeed, vertical speed, location of touchdown point on runway, etc. While current applications of machine learning to aviation focus on retrospective insights to implement corrective measures, they offer limited value for real-time risk identification or decision-making as they are inherently reactive in nature. In this work, a novel offline-online framework is developed for building a global predictive model offline to predict landing performance metrics online. The framework leverages flight data from the approach phase between certain approach altitudes (also called gates) in order to train the offline model to predict the landing true airspeed and ground speed using a Random Forest regression algorithm. Permutation importance is used to identify and retain important features among those available and the training data is balanced with respect to flight safety events to ensure a good performing model. The developed global model is robust and can predict landing true airspeed and ground speed with root mean square errors of 2.62 and 2.98 knots respectively over six different airframes operating at over seventy airports. The model operates fast in prediction mode which, coupled with the ability to provide the prediction at an altitude where a go-around decision may be made, makes it particularly suitable for online application. The framework is demonstrated using data obtained from commercial airline operations that contains thousands of flight records and performs better than existing techniques in literature at predicting true airspeed and ground speed at touchdown.}

abstract = {With the fast development of automated vehicle (AV) technologies, scholars have proposed various innovative local traffic control schemes for more effective management of AV traffic, especially at intersections. However, due to computational intractability, the investigation of network-level AV control is still at the initial stage. This study proposes a space-time routing framework applicable in dedicated AV zones. To relieve the computational load, we establish a node-based conflict point network to model realistic road networks, and at each conflict point, we record the space-time occupations of AVs in continuous timelines. Then, based on the conflict point network, we develop two space-time routing algorithms for each AV once it enters the dedicated AV zone to minimize its trip travel time while maintaining the non-collision insurances; these two algorithms can trade-off between solution quality and computational load. Furthermore, to enhance the network throughput for handling heavy traffic, we develop a ”platoon strategy” that forces AVs to pass through conflict points in platoons, and we adopt Deep Q-learning (DQN) to optimize the platoon sizes at different spots dynamically. Numerical tests show that both proposed algorithms perform well in that they can execute the routing tasks with very limited computational time, and the average vehicle delay approaches zero when the traffic is relatively mild. Meanwhile, compared with the FCFS policy and the optimization-based approach, the platoon strategy can greatly reduce the average vehicle delay under congested scenarios and give a better balance between the optimality and real-time performance.}

Most of the existing algorithms for the user equilibrium-based traffic assignment problem are developed and implemented sequentially. This paper aims to study and investigate the parallel computing approach to utilize the widely available parallel computing resources. The PBCD algorithm is developed based on the state-of-the-art path-based algorithm, i.e., the improved path-based gradient projection algorithm (iGP). The computationally expensive components in the iGP are identified and parallelized. A parallel block-coordinate method is proposed to replace the widely used Gauss-Seidel method for the procedure of path flow adjustment. A new rule is proposed to group OD pairs into different blocks. The numerical examples show that the implemented PBCD algorithm can significantly reduce the computing time.}

Medium-term demand forecasting is a significant insight to optimise resource allocation (staff and vehicles) and reduce operations costs. Using operational data from the reservation platform of the paratransit services in Toulouse, France, and enriching them with exogenous information, the study derives statistical and deep learning models for medium-term forecast. These models include a seasonal ARIMAX model with rolling forecast, a Random Forest Regressor, a LSTM neural network with exogenous information and a CNN neural network with independent variables. The seasonal ARIMAX model yields the best performance, suggesting that when linear relationships are considered, econometric models and deep learning models do not have significant differences in their performance. All the models show limited ability to grasp unique events with multi-day impacts such as strikes. Albeit a highly volatile demand and limited knowledge ahead of the forecast, these models suggest the volume of early reservations is a good proxy for the daily demand.}

abstract = {The establishment of dedicated automated vehicle (AV) lanes has been regarded as an effective approach for addressing heterogeneous traffic with both AVs and regular vehicles (RVs), promoting both traffic efficiency and safety. However, building new dedicated AV lanes in urban areas is not cost effective in the early stage of AV adoption. Fortunately, dedicated bus rapid transit (BRT) lanes can provide a separate right-of-way (ROW) for AVs, which is a practical and economical alternative for promoting AV development. In this paper, we propose an innovative idea of allowing AVs to use dedicated BRT lanes, and quantitatively analyze the stationary performance of mixed-use lanes. Specifically, the analysis is conducted through a cyclic space–time model for AVs on the mixed-use lane, and a sequential optimization method (SOM) is proposed to approximately solve the model. With the SOM providing a valid tool for performance evaluation, we then develop an assignment model for the routing of AVs on a traffic corridor with both mixed-use lane and general-purpose lanes to minimize the total travel time of both AVs and RVs. The model is formulated as a black-box nonlinear program without an explicit analytical form; a successive linear programming (SLP) algorithm with finite difference for gradient approximation is then utilized to solve the nonlinear program. Numerical experiments are conducted in different scenarios, which reveal that the establishment of the mixed-use lane can not only improve the efficiency of AVs but also alleviate the congestion on general-purpose lanes.}

However, when users interact with the apps, the real potential and also the real challenge for modeling user behavior is that the apps not merely are data collection tools, but also change users’ behaviors.

abstract = {Introduction of autonomous and connected trucks (ACTs) is expected to result in drastic changes in operational characteristics of freight shipments, which may in turn have significant impacts on highway safety, vehicle fuel consumption, and infrastructure durability. One such important change is the formation of truck platoons which can be defined as the convoy of trucks travelling in a very close distance. Reducing congestion, regulating traffic, and improving fuel efficiency are some of reported and expected benefits of platooning. Yet such platooning operations may accelerate the damage accumulation within pavement structures because the lateral position of successive trucks within a lane is expected to be similar (i.e., channelized traffic) and the time between two consecutive axle loads (i.e., resting period) is expected to be reduced. Therefore, this study develops a platooning-control strategy for a fleet of ACTs such that the lateral position of trucks and spacing between them can be explicitly optimized to minimize damage to the pavement. Pavement damage is simulated using recently developed pavement performance models. On the other hand, fluid dynamics models were developed to compute fuel-cost due to aerodynamic drags. Three numerical optimization algorithms, genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization and pattern search algorithm were used to solve the objective function. The proposed control strategy efficiency is demonstrated through a case study; relative costs to agencies and users could be reduced by 9\%.}

Efforts have been taken to improve traffic conflict point performance via trajectory control of connected automated vehicles (CAV) as the CAV technology emerges. One major challenge to these efforts is the complexity in optimization of CAV trajectories, particularly with joint signal timing optimization. This challenge poses barriers to real-time application requirements, scaling them up to address network level problems and drawing analytical insights into problem structures. To overcome this challenge, this paper aims to seek for an efficient and analytical solution to a joint vehicle trajectory and signal timing optimization problem. This problem simultaneously optimizes CAV trajectories and signal timing to minimize travel delay and energy consumption at a conflicting point with two traffic approaches. This study modifies the original complex formulation in two ways. First, the vehicle trajectory shape is simplified into a piece-wise quadratic function with no more than five segments. Second, instead of using the highly non-linear instantaneous fuel consumption function, a simplified macroscopic measure is proposed to approximate fuel consumption as an analytical quadratic function of signal red interval. These simplifications provide elegant theoretical properties that enable solving an analytical exact solution to this complex problem with parsimonious analytical insights. Numerical examples reveal that the proposed model can significantly reduce travel delay and fuel consumption. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the presented algorithm is highly efficient and appropriate for real-world traffic applications.}

As observed demand cannot be higher than available supply, historical transport data typically represents a biased, or censored, version of the true underlying demand pattern. Without explicitly accounting for this inherent distinction, predictive models of demand would necessarily represent a biased version of true demand, thus less effectively predicting the needs of service users. To counter this problem, we propose a general method for censorship-aware demand modeling, for which we derive a censored likelihood function capable of handling time-varying supply. We apply this method to the task of shared mobility demand prediction by incorporating the censored likelihood within a Gaussian Process model, which can flexibly approximate arbitrary functional forms. Experiments on artificial and real-world datasets show how taking into account the limiting effect of supply on demand is essential in the process of obtaining an unbiased predictive model of user demand behavior.}

State-of-the-art probabilistic forecasts from Ensemble Prediction Systems are employed to characterize uncertainty in the wind and potential convective areas. A robust optimal control methodology to produce efficient and predictable aircraft trajectories in the presence of these uncertainties is presented. Aircraft motion is assumed to be at a constant altitude and variable speed, considering BADA4 as the aircraft performance model. A set of Pareto-optimal trajectories is obtained for different preferences among predictability, convective risk, and average cost index running a thorough parametric study on a North Atlantic crossing use case. Results show that the cost of reducing the arrival time window by 10 s. is between 100 and 200 kg or 3 and 6 min., depending on the cost-index. They also show that reducing the exposure to convection by 50 km is on the order of 5 and 10 min. or 100 and 200 kg. of average fuel consumption.}

Therefore, the precise prediction of train arrival delays at the MLSs can efficiently support train operation rescheduling plans and reduce delay propagation in the railway network. The arrival routes of trains at the MLSs are critical factors for managing train arrival delays, since there may be latent route conflicts with forward arrival/departure trains. However, route conflicts will not occur at single-line stations (SLSs) that are traversed by only one railway line. Existing train delay prediction studies have considered the ways that trains arrive at/depart from stations as black boxes, but have not considered the latent route conflicts from a microscopic view. This study considers the arrival routes of predicted trains and route conflicts with forward trains, for contemplating the gap (not considering the route conflicts from other railway lines) in the existing studies. The influencing factors are separated into three categories according to the data attributes, namely, route-related variables, delay-related variables, and environment-related variables. Then, an architecture called LLCF-net is proposed, with a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) block for route-related variables, two long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for delay-related variables, and a fully connected neural network (FCNN) block for environment-related variables. Compared with the methods in exiting studies, this architecture showed the best performance for both two MLSs—GuangzhouSouth(GZS) and ChangshaSouth (CSS)—on the Chinese high-speed railway network, regardless of the consideration of route-related variables. In addition, LLCF-net is proven to have a strong predictive effectiveness and a robust performance for different delay lengths.}

This paper considers traffic signal control and road pricing together; aiming to eliminate queueing in at least a subnetwork. Link-exit green-times and link-exit bottleneck delays are considered first in some detail; largely using a simple network. The paper then shows that policy P0, specified in Smith (1980, 2015), is capacity-maximising for a general network with vertical queueing delays. Then link exit prices, co-ordinated with green-times and also red times, are considered. It is shown that using prices (instead of delays) in the P0 control policy maximises the capacity of a general steady state network, with zero queues. This steady state capacity-maximisation ＋ zero-queue result is then extended to dynamic networks in two ways; an equilibrium extension and a day-to-day stability extension. The equilibrium extension shows that P0-with-prices maximises network capacity with zero queues in a dynamic network and the stability extension shows that a smoothed version of the P0-with-prices policy, called P0f, is able to deliver some stability as well as zero queue capacity maximisation. A simple example network has been given to illustrate several of the control-with-prices policies. It is shown that a biased version of P0-with-prices, Ph-with-prices, yields, for this simple network, higher utility than P0-with-prices itself.}

Then, we study optimizing the track maintenance based on this model. We demonstrate that a temporal threshold-type inspection policy is optimal, and we derive this threshold under imperfect inspections.

Since there are many transit lines operating in the metropolis, the max-pressure signal control should be extended to multi-modal transportation systems to achieve more widespread usage. The standard max-pressure controller is more likely to actuate phases during high-demand approaches, which may end up ignoring the arrival of buses, especially in bus rapid transit. In this paper, we propose a novel max-pressure signal control that considers transit signal priority of bus rapid transit systems to achieve both maximum stability for private vehicles and reliable transit service. This study revises the original max-pressure control to include constraints that provide priority for buses. Furthermore, this policy is decentralized which means it only relies on it relies only on the local conditions of each intersection. We set the simulation on the real-world road network with bus rapid transit systems. Numerical results show that the max-pressure signal control which considers transit signal priority can still achieve maximum stability compared with other signal control integrated with transit signal priority. Furthermore, the max-pressure control reduces private vehicle travel time and bus travel time compared to the current signal control.}

This system is suitable for low and heterogeneous passenger demand distribution as it features a hybrid system layout that includes both a hub-and-spoke network in the peripheral region and a grid network in the central region, along with heterogeneous local routes that address local demand variations. Continuum approximation (C.A.) is used to reduce the computation burden by formulating the design problem with respect to a few decision variables. We compare the performance of the proposed transit system with (i) the typical fixed-route system, (ii) the homogeneous flexible-route grid system, and (iii) the flexible-route grid system with local routes, in hypothetical settings. It is found through our numerical examples that the integration of the three proposed features (i.e. flexible transit, local tubes, and hybrid structure), as compared to counterparts with only two or fewer features, yields lower combined agency and user costs under the assumed low heterogeneous demand distribution. We then apply the design framework to a more realistic case for the City of Changzhi, China. An implementable design for Changzhi is developed, and its performance verified with simulations, demonstrating accuracy and applicability of the proposed continuum approximation model.}

abstract = {During a pandemic such as COVID-19, managing public transit effectively becomes a critical policy decision. On the one hand, efficient transportation plays a pivotal role in enabling the movement of essential workers and keeping the economy moving. On the other hand, public transit can be a vector for disease propagation due to travelers’ proximity within shared and enclosed spaces. Without strategic preparedness, mass transit facilities are potential hotbeds for spreading infectious diseases. Thus, transportation agencies face a complex trade-off when developing context-specific operating strategies for public transit. This work provides a network-based analysis framework for understanding this trade-off, as well as tools for calculating targeted commute restrictions under different policy constraints, e.g., regarding public health considerations (limiting infection levels) and economic activity (limiting the reduction in travel). The resulting plans ensure that the traffic flow restrictions imposed on each route are adaptive to the time-varying epidemic dynamics. A case study based on the COVID-19 pandemic reveals that a well-planned subway system in New York City can sustain 88\% of transit flow while reducing the risk of disease transmission by 50\% relative to fully-loaded public transit systems. Transport policy-makers can exploit this optimization-based framework to address safety-and-mobility trade-offs and make proactive transit management plans during an epidemic outbreak.}

abstract = {Traffic conflict techniques are a viable alternative to crash-based safety assessments and are particularly well suited to evaluating emerging technologies such as connected and automated vehicles for which crash data are sparsely available. Recently, the use of multiple traffic conflict indicators has become common in methodological studies, yet it is often difficult to determine which conflict indicators are appropriate given the application context, and the net benefit, in terms of improved crash prediction accuracy, of considering additional conflict indicators. Addressing these concerns, this study investigates the potential benefits of multiple conflict indicators for conflict-based crash estimation models by using a multivariate extreme value modeling framework (with Gumbel-Hougaard copulas) to estimate crash frequency by severity. The selected conflict indicators include Modified Time-To-Collision (MTTC), Deceleration Rate to Avoid a Collision (DRAC), Proportion of Stopping Distance (PSD) and expected post-collision change in velocity (Delta-V). The proposed framework was applied to estimate the total, severe (Maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale ≥ 3; MAIS3+), and non-severe (MAIS < 3) rear-end crash frequencies at three four-legged signalized intersections in Brisbane, Australia. Rear-end traffic conflicts were extracted from video data using state-of-the-art Computer Vision analytics. Results show that the prediction performance improvements are not necessarily proportional to the number of conflict indicators used in extreme value models. MTTC and DRAC, combined with the severity indicator Delta-V, were the most suitable predictors of rear-end crashes at signalized intersections. Results suggest that instead of adding more and more conflict indicators, careful selection of compatible conflict indicators (considering their functional differences and empirical correlations) is the best way to enhance the predictive performance of conflict-based models.}

This paper models impacts of time-dependent order cancellation behaviour on the driver–rider matching efficiency and examines ridesourcing platform operation strategies, where taxi is the alternative to the ridesourcing mode. A time-dependent matching model is developed to characterize the complex interaction among participants (drivers and riders) considering ridesourcing order cancellation behaviour, where the impact of the cancelled orders on the numbers of drivers and riders is explicitly modelled. In particular, we formulate the time-dependent order cancellation rates before and after the matching stage (i.e., cancellation of unconfirmed and confirmed orders). Under the proposed model, a platform profit maximization problem is formulated and three pricing strategies are examined. Our numerical studies demonstrate that the dynamic pricing (i.e., customer/rider fare and driver wage) can well accommodate time-dependent system inputs (e.g., demand rates) and thus enable the platform to increase profit via better market segmentation. We also investigate the objective of maximizing the number of completed trips and examine the trade-off between the platform profit and the number of completed trips. In addition, we show that the relaxation of upper bounds of the ridesourcing fare and order cancellation penalty can increase the ridesourcing platform’s profit and indirectly improve the utilization rate of taxis as well as the taxi company’s profit.}

In the modular service operation, the vehicle is comprised of smaller modular units/pods, which can be assembled/dissembled at some specially designed transit stations. The planning decisions are to determine the locations of the specially constructed stations enabling station-wise assembling/dissembling of modular units. Meanwhile, the capacity of these stations, i.e., the maximum number of modular units that can be accommodated, will also be determined. The optimal vehicle formation at these stations will be considered for the multi-period passenger demand to evaluate the system performance. Aiming to minimize the total cost of the operator and passengers, we formulate this problem into a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). Two solution methods are proposed to solve the problem. One is to transform the formulated MINLP into a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) using various linearization reformulation techniques, which can be solved by using many existing solution methods for MILP. Despite that this method ensures exact solutions, its solution efficiency is compromised. To solve a practical large-size problem, we propose another solution method applying surrogate model-based optimization approaches. A case study in the context of a proposed Singapore dynamic autonomous road transit (DART) line is conducted. Numerical experiments have been carried out to test the validity of the model formulation and the solution performance of the proposed solution methods. The advantage of the modular-vehicle transit service in significantly reducing the operating cost and passengers’ travel time costs has been demonstrated as well. This study offers the public transportation planners a useful tool for determining optimal operation strategies for the future transit service system with modular vehicles.}

abstract = {Theoretical models of vehicular traffic ascribe the fundamental cause of velocity oscillations and stop-and-go waves to suboptimal or unpredictable human driving behavior. In this paper we ask: if vehicles were controlled or assisted by algorithms, and hence driven “optimally,” would these phenomena simply go away? If they do not, how should a regulator manage algorithm-assisted vehicular traffic for a smooth flow? We study these questions in the context of a mandatory lane-changing scenario from the perspective of an algorithm-assisted driver on a curtailed lane that has to merge to an adjacent free lane with a relatively dense platoon. In a stylized model of algorithm-assisted driving, we liken the blocked-lane driver to a rational self-interested agent, whose objective is to minimize her expected travel time through the blockage, deciding (a) at what velocity to move, and (b) whether to merge to the free lane if an adequate gap arises. Moving at higher velocities reduces travel time, but also reduces the probability of finding a large enough gap to merge. We analyze the problem via dynamic programming, and we show that the optimal policy has a surprising structure: in the presence of uncertainty on adequate-sized gaps in the target lane, it may be optimal for the blocked-lane driver, in certain parameter regimes, to oscillate between high and low velocities while attempting to merge. Hence, traffic oscillations can arise not just due to suboptimal or unpredictable human driving behavior, but also endogenously, as the outcome of a driver’s rational, optimizing behavior. We provide theoretical support for this finding by drawing similarities to bang–bang control. As velocity oscillations are known to be detrimental to a smooth traffic flow, we provide sufficient conditions such that traffic oscillations, due to such optimizing behavior, do not arise. Finally, we investigate the fundamental flow-density and travel time-density diagrams through traffic micro-simulations performed in SUMO. We establish that the proposed approach exhibits consistently near-optimal performance, in a broad variety of traffic conditions.}

Previous works have integrated information perturbation into coordinated routing mechanisms and theoretically proved that the system performance improvement due to information perturbation is more significant than the corresponding average user optimality loss. However, they do not give direct guidance as to which perturbation level should be implemented to manage the competing effects of system performance improvement and user optimality loss most efficiently. Accordingly, the goal of this work is to uncover the optimal perturbation that should be included in the information sent to vehicles under a coordinated routing scheme under some known network condition. The optimal perturbation problem considers the tradeoff between system performance improvement and user optimality loss due to perturbation, while ensuring that no exorbitant individual user optimality loss occurs. The relationships used in the optimization models are obtained through gaussian process regression, which are trained using the output of computer experiments. We pay special attention to the input features of these models, which impact the system performance and user optimality loss in our model the most—namely the perturbation, demand, and routing competition levels. We model route competition levels through a new parameter called weighted concentration, and present a novel approach for sampling weighted competition values for a single demand level. We present several candidate gaussian process specifications which are used in the optimization, including single and multiple output. Finally, we demonstrate the merit of our methodology through a sensitivity analysis using the Sioux Falls network as a test case. Here, we find that our optimization approach can find robust solutions (in terms of their proximity to local optimums) relatively high rate, with a satisfied solution time.}

abstract = {The path flow reconstruction problem is used to determine the minimum set of links that must be equipped with traffic monitoring devices to identify vehicle paths in a road network. This study addresses the path flow reconstruction problem in a connected vehicles (CVs) environment. Unlike traditional sensors that can observe both CVs and non-connected vehicles (NCVs), CV-enabled infrastructures, known as roadside units (RSUs), can only identify CVs on roads through vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communications. They can, however, provide critical traffic information, including traces of the historical trajectories of CVs and possibly the desired path to a destination, thereby inferring partial information on links that are not directly covered by RSUs. RSUs have an “area” rather than a “point” coverage capability. This allows them to simultaneously monitor more than one link. We mathematically developed four variant formulations for the path flow reconstruction problem to optimally locate either a network’s RSU or a mix of the network’s RSUs and automatic vehicle identification (AVI) sensors. The first two models assume 100\% market penetration of CVs and the first model determines the links that should be directly covered by RSUs in a road network. While the desired path to a destination is assumed to be unknown. This model determines an upper bound for the number of RSUs required to fully reconstruct path flows by using each RSU to directly cover a link. To consider the coverage and range of the RSU (where RSU can cover more than one link) and to minimize the total cost, Model II optimizes the locations of traditional AVI sensors and RSUs. This allows the model to capitalize on the RSUs’ area and indirect coverage features to fully reconstruct path flow in a road network. Model III considers the gradual deployment of CVs and thus the prevailing mixed traffic environment consisting of both CVs and NCVs. Accordingly, this model relaxes the assumption of a 100\% penetration rate of CVs and maximizes the path flow information gain subject to a budget constraint in a mixed traffic environment. Finally, Model IV explores the infrastructure to infrastructure (I2I) communication capability among RSUs, further maximizing the traffic flow information gain of CVs while guaranteeing full path flow reconstruction. The results suggest that fewer RSUs than AVI sensors are required to reach full path flow reconstruction in a road network. The level of unique path flow information obtained from RSUs is also considerably higher than what can be obtained from AVI sensors. It is demonstrated that, in mixed traffic conditions, the coverage range of RSUs and their cost compared to AVI sensors can significantly affect the deployment of either type of sensing devices for maximized path flow information gain.}

The design problem aims at finding a network design for the fixed routes to allow a set of riders to travel from their origins to their destinations, while minimizing the sum of the travel costs, the bus operating costs, and rider travel times. The paper addresses two gaps in existing tools for designing ODMTS. First, it generalizes prior work by including ridesharing in the shuttle rides. Second, it proposes novel fleet-sizing algorithms for determining the number of shuttles needed to meet the performance metrics of the ODMTS design. Both contributions are based on Mixed-Integer Programs (MIP). For the ODMTS design, the MIP reasons about pickup and dropoff routes in order to capture ridesharing, grouping riders who travel to/from the same hub. The fleet-sizing optimization is modeled as a minimum flow problem with covering constraints. The natural formulation leads to a dense graph and computational issues, which is addressed by a reformulation that works on a sparse graph. The methodological contributions are evaluated on a real case study: the public transit system of the broader Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti region in Michigan. The results demonstrate the substantial potential of ridesharing for ODMTS, as costs are reduced by about 26\% with respect to allowing only individual shuttle rides, at the expense of a minimal increase in transit times. Compared to the existing system, the designed ODMTS also cuts down costs by 35\% and reduces transit times by 38\%.}

The most effective way to remove macro-debris floating offshore is to send vessels to collect it. We employ advanced remote sensing technology to locate debris and vessels equipped with a hybrid energy system composed of photovoltaic, battery packs and diesel to collect debris. In order to establish an effective collection mechanism in an economical and eco-friendly manner, we propose a two-stage optimization approach of vessel routing and energy management strategy. In the first stage, a mixed integer linear programming is to minimize the vessel travel time for removing debris, which is reduced to the vessel routing problem with time window considering discrete speed. Advanced remote sensing technology and trajectory prediction software are used to locate debris at sea. An adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm with pheromone heuristic rule is tailored to solve the problem. A mixed integer linear programming model is proposed to optimize the power flow for the hybrid energy system in the second stage. The objective is to minimize the total cost, taking into account of the constraints of power load balance, battery charge and discharge state and output limit of each energy source. The proposed models and algorithm are validated by a group of numerical examples with different sizes. Compared with VRP Spreadsheet Solver and CPLEX solver, our proposed algorithm not only has obvious advantages in both time and results, but also has cubic function fitting property in time complexity within 100 data. We also compare the optimal power flow and total cost under three illumination intensity scenarios and analyze the optimal power flow for each energy. We find that in optimal power flow, diesel can charge the battery only if it supplies power to vessel load. The results show that compared with the pure diesel system, the hybrid energy system has an overwhelming advantage in terms of total cost and carbon emissions, which can be reduced by 65.78\% and 82.69\%, respectively. We also find no change in the cost savings of hybrid vessels when considering battery and diesel life-cycle carbon emissions.}

abstract = {The emerging technologies of connectivity and automation enable the potential for signal-free intersection control. In this context, virtual platooning is posited to be an innovative, decentralized control strategy that maps two-dimensional vehicle movements onto a one-dimension virtual platoon to enable intersection operations. However, the effectiveness of virtual platooning-based control can be limited or degraded by parametric inaccuracies and unparameterized disturbances in vehicle dynamics, heavy traffic congestion, and/or uncoordinated platoons in multi-lane intersections. To explicitly address these limitations, this study proposes a hybrid cooperative intersection control framework consisting of microscopic-level virtual platooning control and macroscopic-level traffic flow regulation for traffic environments with connected autonomous vehicles. In virtual platooning control, vehicles approaching an intersection are organized into coordinated independent virtual platoons to avoid potential conflicts triggered by platoon formation changes. Through coordination, vehicles in a platoon are grouped into compatible passing sets to maintain desired safe spacing when proceeding through the intersection. We propose a distributed adaptive sliding mode controller (DASMC) which uses the backstepping control method and model reference adaptive control method to address parametric inaccuracies, and the sliding mode control method to consistently suppress the negative effects of the unparameterized disturbances. Each vehicle approaching the intersection utilizes the kinematic information from neighboring vehicles to implement the DASMC in a distributed manner such that vehicles within the same virtual platoon can achieve consensus safely. However, virtual platooning control cannot preclude excessive traffic from approaching the intersection, which can cause undesired spillbacks and degrade intersection control performance. To address this issue, traffic flow regulation is integrated with the virtual platooning control using an iterative feedback loop mechanism. In each iteration of the iterative feedback loop, a constrained finite-time optimal control (CFTOC) problem is solved to determine the optimal input flow permitted to proceed through the intersection, and the virtual platooning control provides feedback on the queue status to the CFTOC to initiate the next iteration. The effectiveness of the proposed intersection control framework is evaluated through numerical experiments. The results indicate that the proposed virtual platooning DASMC controller can mitigate the effects of parametric inaccuracies and unparameterized disturbances to achieve consensus for approaching vehicles, as well as guarantee string stability. Further, the proposed framework can alleviate traffic spillbacks and travel delays effectively through traffic flow regulation.}

The asymmetric nature of bike demand causes the need for rebalancing bike stations, which is typically done during nighttime. To determine the optimal starting inventory level of a station for a given day, a User Dissatisfaction Function (UDF) models user pickups and returns as non-homogeneous Poisson processes with piece-wise linear rates. In this paper, we devise a deep generative model directly applicable in the UDF by introducing a variational Poisson recurrent neural network model (VP-RNN) to forecast future pickup and return rates. We empirically evaluate our approach against both traditional and learning-based forecasting methods on real trip travel data from the city of New York, USA, and show how our model outperforms benchmarks in terms of system efficiency and demand satisfaction. By explicitly focusing on the combination of decision-making algorithms with learning-based forecasting methods, we highlight a number of shortcomings in literature. Crucially, we show how more accurate predictions do not necessarily translate into better inventory decisions. By providing insights into the interplay between forecasts, model assumptions, and decisions, we point out that forecasts and decision models should be carefully evaluated and harmonized to optimally control shared mobility systems.}

However, before CVs fully replace non-connected vehicles (NCVs), it is envisioned that CVs and NCVs will coexist for a long time. This brings challenges for OPA because of the availability constraints imposed by the uncertain arrivals and departures of NCVs. This paper proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework to generate efficient OPA strategies with partial observations of parking demand. Specifically, we create two agents, one for measuring the impact of NCVs and the other for exploring the parking characteristics of CVs. A value decomposition method is adopted to solve the multi-agent learning problem, and a modified exploration strategy is designed to direct agent training and avoid unnecessary trials. To verify the performance of the proposed approach, we derive the baselines of the total time expenditure in a parking area based on the widely adopted first-come-first-served strategy and a hypothetical system optimum strategy, respectively. Also, we present a dynamic assignment model with forecasting as a comparison of the proposed approach with the same demand information. Two typical parking scenarios are selected to conduct comparative experiments with actual operating data. The experimental results show that the proposed learning-based approach can effectively allocate parking resources. Provided with user parking information of CVs short in advance, our approach can achieve up to 15\% improvement in assignment performance compared with other baselines.}

We estimated hybrid choice models and binary logit models, which show that users’ sociodemographic and travel attitudes are the main factors impacting the shift from different modes to pooled rides. Service-related characteristics such as multi-tasking, trip fare, and avoiding parking problems also impact the shift decision. On the other hand, the frequency of service use is mainly impacted by trip characteristics such as total trip distance, and the headway at the user’s home location nearest Metro stations. Income, employment status, number of cars in the household, and gender were the only sociodemographic factors impacting the service use frequency directly and indirectly.}

For modeling aggressive driving behavior, previous studies have typically relied on summative statistics (e.g. means and S.D.) as the inputs which fall short in extracting features of driving behaviors that are in a time-series pattern. The raw data are used to extract the pieces of the graph. Each graph represents a specific driving trip that includes driver characteristics, environment information, and driving behavior variables. Graphs of trips were constructed based on the Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study data. 17 variables related to aggressive driving are extracted and converted into elements (pieces as described in the paper) in the construction graphs. Regression models are used for verifying the performance of using graph construction as the input in modeling. The result shows that a 5-sec time window is suitable for aggressive driving behavior modeling. 11 variables (speed, longitudinal acceleration, lateral acceleration, lateral displacement, gender, age, distracted, drowsy, weather, horizontal alignment, time-to-collision) are selected for graph construction based on their significance. Both summative statistics and graph construction are applied. The result shows that graph construction achieves better performance over models based on summative statistic inputs (mean plus standard deviation, and mean only). Based on weights of variables, time-to-collision is found to be the factor which affects aggressive driving most. This method can be used in real-world applications to improve driving safety by alerting drivers of aggressive behavior identified in real time with Advanced Driver Assistance System applications.}

An online hybrid mechanism is proposed with four incentive objectives: promoting passengers to participate by satisfying their mobility preferences, inducing passengers to truthfully reveal their mobility preferences, incentivizing the service provider to be financially sustainable, and incentivizing more regular commuters to early schedule the service. We propose and prove four properties, “preference-based individual rationality”, “preference-based incentive compatibility”, “financial sustainability”, and “scheduling preferability” to achieve the four incentive objectives, respectively.

In order to obtain the large-scale solutions for the online hybrid mechanism, this paper improves the solution pooling approach (SPA), which was originally proposed in our previous work for a static offline mechanism, to adapt for the online hybrid mechanism. The improved SPA successfully sustains the “preference-based individual rationality”, “financial sustainability”, and “scheduling preferability” properties. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed online hybrid mechanism over the static offline mechanism and the outperformance of the improved SPA over the original SPA.}

A key but unsolved question is whether there is a theoretical bound to the accuracy with which traffic can be predicted and whether that limit can be directly estimated from data. To answer this question, we use core concepts in information theory to derive the limit of predictability in short-term traffic forecasting. Theoretical analysis proves that conditional differential entropy poses a rigorous lower bound of negative-log-likelihood (NLL) for probabilistic models. And the continuous form of Fano’s theorem further gives a loose lower bound of mean-square-error (MSE) for deterministic models. Based on the special properties of traffic dynamics, two assumptions are made in the estimate of entropy metrics: cyclostationarity (traffic phenomena show strong periodicity) and localized spatial correlation (due to kinematic wave propagation). They allow formulating the limit of predictability as a function of longitudinal space and time-of-day which finds the most uncertain locations and periods solely from data. Experiments on univariate traffic accumulation forecasting and network-level speed forecasting show that the selected models, including some state-of-the-art deep learning models, indeed cannot outperform the estimated lower bounds but just approach them. The limit of predictability depends on time-of-day, network locations, observation range, and prediction horizon. The results reveal that the stochastic nature of traffic dynamics and improper assumptions on the prior distribution of output are two major factors that restrict the predictive performance. In summary, the proposed method estimates a trustworthy performance boundary for most traffic forecasting models. These conclusions are helpful for further studies in this domain.}

However, the current RL algorithms still suffer from challenges in reliability, especially compared to the rule/model-based algorithms that are pre-engineered, human-input intensive, but widely used in autonomous vehicles. To take advantages of both the RL and rule-based algorithms, this work aims to design a decision-making framework that leverages RL and use an existing rule-based policy as its performance lower bound. In this way, the final policy remains the potential of self-learning, while guaranteeing a better system performance compared with the integrated rule-based policy. Such a decision-making framework is called trustworthy improvement RL (TiRL). The basic idea is to make the RL policy iteration process synchronously estimate the given rule-based policy’s value function. AV will then use the RL policy to drive only in the cases where the RL has learned a better policy, i.e., a higher policy value. This work takes highway safe driving as the case study. The results are obtained through more than 42,000 km driving in stochastic simulated traffic, and calibrated by naturalistic driving data. The TiRL planner is given two typical rule-based highway-driving policies for comparison. The results show that the TiRL can outperform the given arbitrary rule-based driving policy. In summary, the proposed TiRL can leverage the learning-based method in stochastic and emergent scenarios, while having a trustworthy safety improvement from the existing rule-based policies.}

Spurred by this trend, an increasing number of companies have been formed, which promotes the expansion of the carsharing market. In the presence of intensifying competitive pressure, it has become imperative for companies to determine their optimal operational strategies by adjusting their pricing and relocation strategies to ensure financially sustainable service operations. Indeed, the most urgent issue that must be addressed is the modeling of an integrated framework combining the pricing and relocation strategies of operators in a competitive market. To solve this problem, a game-theoretical multi-leader–follower model is proposed to maximize the profit of each company involved and minimize the disutility of travelers, the Nash equilibrium solution of which is obtained by developing a diagonalization algorithm framework. Specifically, in each iteration, a bilevel model is solved to obtain the best response, which is the most favorable outcome for a certain company given competing companies’ strategies. The upper level aims to determine the pricing and relocation strategy of each company, while the lower level assigns trip demand by solving a stochastic user equilibrium problem. The proposed method is applied to a hypothetical case study and a realistic example in the context of Quanzhou city, China, and its performance is demonstrated by extensive sensitivity analysis. The results show that the total profits of the market rise with the number of companies increasing, but the average profit and price drop. Through a comparison between strategies with and without relocations, it is found that relocation strategies have a significant impact on raising profits of a company with a large fleet size.}

Compared to traditional bike-sharing systems, ebike-sharing systems are more complicated as the platform needs to handle battery recharging issues as well as the imbalance between supply and demand. However, previous studies have not discussed how to address the two issues effectively. In this paper, we consider a dockless ebike-sharing system with removable ebike batteries and introduce vans to such a system to solve recharging and rebalancing problems simultaneously. In other words, during the operational horizon, van drivers can choose among rebalancing tasks, battery swapping tasks, and half-rebalancing-half-swapping tasks. This paper utilizes the Markov decision process to depict the highly dynamic ebike-sharing system with a platform player (agent) and a representative van driver player (agent). In such a system, van drivers choose their tasks to maximize their income, and the platform allocates spatiotemporal subsidies with predefined subsidy amounts to incentivize van drivers and optimize the profit. To efficiently solve the dynamic optimization problem with mixed agents, we apply the dueling double deep Q-network method which is an advanced reinforcement learning approach. We conduct numerical studies based on a real-world dataset in New York City, and evaluate the performance of the proposed operational services under different schemes. Our results show that the proposed van-based services for battery swapping and rebalancing could help increase the platform's profit and van drivers' earnings, and improve system performance. Additionally, it is also proved that the platform, van drivers, and the overall ebike-sharing system all benefit from spatiotemporal subsidies.}

These operations are challenging due to low passenger volumes, competing transportation modes, and high operating costs. Nevertheless, the recent convergence of new technologies for electric propulsion and autonomy brings the promise of step-changes in both operating efficiency and sustainability. The next challenge is to define concepts of operations that best use these advanced aircraft. We develop a modeling and optimization environment to address this challenge by first estimating the passenger demand for regional air mobility, and then by concurrently optimizing the fleet assignment and scheduling of these operations. This helps identify the optimum fleet composition and the network of routes that best serve this demand. The contribution of this research is the formulation of the optimization as a half-leg half-itinerary mixed-integer linear program using a hierarchical multi-objective approach that provides insights about trade-offs between profitability and emissions. We demonstrate the ability of this environment to solve large fleet assignment and scheduling problems to near optimality by applying it to the United States Northeast Corridor using a fleet of electric and hybrid-electric regional aircraft. Results highlight that the transition to an electrified fleet allows serving twice the number of communities currently served, while reducing the carbon emissions per passenger by fifty percent. With improving battery specific energy density, many more untapped markets can be served profitably and sustainably, and many smaller communities can get connected to the rest of the National Airspace System.}

abstract = {In the air traffic control (ATC) system, delays are tightly coupled among airports. Understanding the interactions of these delays is a prerequisite for accurate prediction. However, most researches in this field depend on correlation methods, and few studies apply causal discovery methods. The latest approach uses the cause-and-effect diagram discovery algorithm PCMCI to mine the causal dependencies between time series. In the application context of the ATC system, not all delays have the propagation effect because of a series of optimization measures by airports and airlines. This paper proposes an extreme event measurement mechanism to solve the above problem by setting the airport thresholds adaptively through a complete search of the parameter space. The improved method allows for a more accurate exploration of the time lag delay propagation relationship between airports. The experimental simulation results show that the algorithm in this paper can extract time lag causality in nonlinear, multidimensional time series considering the ATC system characteristics. In addition, we use the causality of airport delays to construct an extreme delay propagation network (EDPN), use complex network theory and related metrics to analyze the network at the system level, and propose a new critical airport identification metric. In the case study of the U.S. aviation system, we find that small airports have a weak ability to mitigate extreme delays and are more likely to propagate delays to other airports in addition to their own impacts; Larger airports have strong mitigation and robustness to extreme delays but suffer from overload operations. These findings are helpful to explain the interactions of delay processes, and can provide specific theoretical support in improving system operation efficiency and developing delay propagation mitigation measures.}

However, their effects on network traffic instability due to turning and merging maneuvers are less known. In this paper, we characterize such effects using the macroscopic or network fundamental diagram (MFD or NFD). We first revisit and extend the theoretical two-ring network, and then develop an integrated modeling and simulation framework that explicitly accounts for different microscopic traffic models of human-driven vehicles (HVs), AVs, and CAVs. Results suggest that network traffic instability resulting from turning and merging maneuvers persists even if vehicles become automated and cooperative. When the turning probability is low, the presence of CAVs does not induce a significant change in the bifurcation point of the NFD. Scatter in both link fundamental diagrams (FDs) and NFDs, however, reduces resulting in higher and more stable network flows. When the turning probability is high, AVs without cooperation turn out to worsen network traffic stability, giving rise to an NFD that undergoes bifurcation long before the theoretical critical network density is reached. This is in contrast to the case with CAVs that perform cooperative merging. Results also suggest that, whenever the penetration rate of CAVs is too low or too high, making HVs connected is not as effective in delaying the bifurcation of the NFD as when the penetration rate is moderate. We further compare cooperative merging with adaptive signal control and adaptive driver routing to demonstrate its benefits in improving network flows. Simulation experiments on a real motorway segment in Sydney, Australia are also performed to confirm our findings.}

In order to measure reliability during the service planning phase, a key piece of information is the long-term prediction of the density of the travel time, which conveys the uncertainty of travel times. This work empirically compares probabilistic models for the prediction of the conditional probability density function (PDF) of the travel time and proposes a simulation framework taking as input the latter distributions to approximate the expected secondary delays, a measure of the reliability of public transport services. Two types of probabilistic models, namely similarity-based density estimation models and a smoothed logistic regression for probabilistic classification model, are compared on a dataset of more than 41,000 trips and 50 bus routes of the city of Montréal. A similarity-based density estimation model using a k-nearest neighbors method and a log-logistic distribution predicted the best estimate of the true conditional PDF of the travel time and generated the most accurate approximations of the expected secondary delays on this dataset. This model reduced the mean squared error of the expected secondary delay by approximately 9\% compared to the benchmark model, namely a random forest. This result highlights the added value of modeling the conditional PDF of the travel time with probabilistic models.}

An operating model has been developed to estimate the number of resources to be deployed (extra vehicles and charging facilities) for two charging schemes: charging at bus garage facility and opportunity charging at on-street chargers. Firstly, the model calculates the entrance and exit time of buses in service assuming an unlimited battery capacity, caused by demand and headway variations in different time periods along day. Then, based on the previous results, the model estimates the moment when vehicles will run out of energy and proposes a charging schedule as well as new vehicle movements between chargers, bus garage and routes to maintain the targeted headway. Consequently, the model is able to calculate the number of resources needed and the total cost for a given route and battery size, allowing cost and performance comparison to diesel and hybrid powertrains. The estimated results in two bus routes in Barcelona indicate that the purchasing cost of BEB vehicles (670,000 euros/veh for articulated, 500,000Euros/veh for standard vehicles, both depreciated over a lifetime of 15 years), battery packs (231 Euro/kWh purchased, depreciated over a lifetime of 10 years), as well as the investment in chargers, are still high to clearly justify their cost-competitiveness against diesel or hybrid counterparts. Nevertheless, if the acquisition cost of both vehicles and battery pack are only reduced by 9\%, the BEB technology may present cost savings for transit agencies. It only happens if the fleet size is as large as the corresponding to diesel and hybrid technologies. Opportunity charging is resulted to be more cost- efficient than charging at bus garage for small battery packs, routes with acceptable time headway adherence and, specially, when fast chargers are located very close to terminal stops. Nevertheless, when the real bus route design and operation do not fulfill these standards, charging scheme at bus garage is preferable.}

A vehicle trajectory describes how the position, speed and acceleration of a vehicle evolves over time. In practice, collecting a complete trajectory data set on a road stretch is not always feasible due to economic and privacy constraints. Therefore, several researchers suggest approaches for generating Virtual Vehicle Trajectories (VVT) given some partially observed traffic data. However, the traditional VVT generation approaches, being originally developed for travel time estimations, usually consider a simplified description of vehicle kinematics, hindering their applicability in emission modelling. In this paper, we suggest a novel approach for generating VVT, which facilitates their use in emission modelling. We empirically evaluate our method by comparing it to the traditional approaches. The results are promising, showing that, under certain experimental settings, our method can enhance the accuracy of emission estimations.}

The connected and automated vehicles (CAV) technology has great capability in improving traffic performance of merging bottlenecks. Current approaches of system optimal cooperative merging control assume single fixed merging point (CMC-SMP) for on-ramp vehicles to reduce the complexity of their models. Non-fixed merging positions have the potential to further improve merging operations but may lead to the computational explosion. To solve this core contradiction, this study proposes a novel hierarchical system optimal cooperative merging control model considering flexible merging positions (CMC-FMP) to realize safe and efficient merging processes. The upper-level – the tactical planning model is formulated as a non-convex mixed integer quadratically constrained programming, aiming at minimal total travel time in the control zone. It optimizes not only the merging sequence but also vehicles’ critical states in merging processes, such as the state of on-ramp vehicles when they merge. The lower-level - the motion planning model generates feasible trajectories and the next step actions for every vehicle. A Monte Carlo Tree Search-based decomposition algorithm (MCTS-DA) is further designed to improve the computational efficiency of the tactical planning model. Meanwhile, solutions of MCTS-DA are proved to have good optimality compared to the direct solving method. A batch-based scheme is developed to realize real-time control. The results reveal that the average delays of CMC-FMP are remarkably lower than those of CMC-SMP. Especially in low on-ramp ratio scenarios, the difference in improvement can reach 64\%. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis indicates that large safe merging margins and short merging sections are disadvantageous for traffic efficiency for the merging flow controlled by CMC-FMP.}

To this end, this research seeks to characterize the damping oscillations of CAVs through exploiting the platoon's unforced oscillatory, i.e., damping behavior. Inspired by the mechanical vibration theory, the proposed approach is applied to a CAV platoon with linear car-following control formulated as Helly's model and the predecessor-following communication topology.

In this paper, we model the order dispatching in a multi-modal transportation system as a large-scale sequential decision-making problem. A centralized algorithm is then proposed to dispatch idle drivers to arriving passenger orders and determine whether to advise passengers to use a combined mode of ride-sourcing and public transit services (if yes, the algorithm also needs to recommend an appropriate transportation hub). In particular, our proposed algorithm contains a reinforcement learning approach that estimates the long-term expected rewards, and an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) that matches idle drivers and waiting passengers in real-time based on both immediate revenue and the estimated long-term rewards. By evaluation on the real-world on-demand data and metro system in Manhattan, the proposed method shows remarkable improvement on the system’s efficiency under different density of supply and demands.}

abstract = {Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) enabled by wireless communication and vehicle automation are believed to revolutionize the form and operation of road transport in the next decades. This paper addresses traffic flow effects of CAVs, and focuses on their lane-changing impacts on the mixed traffic flow of CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs). At present technical paths towards the development and deployment of CAVs are still uncertain. With CAV technologies getting matured, CAVs are supposed to provide rides of higher efficiency than HVs, beyond improved safety and comfort. In heavy traffic, this would only be achievable via agile and flexible lane changes of CAVs, because longitudinal acceleration would be unhelpful or even impossible in mixed traffic. Such lane changes are expected to be ego-efficient in that they serve solely CAVs’ interests without much considering surrounding vehicles, as long as safety constraints are not violated. As road resources are limited, the growth of the CAV population adopting such ego-efficient lane-changing strategies would probably lead to renowned “Tragedy of the Commons”. In this context, this paper considers three important prospective questions: A: How to determine an ego-efficient lane-changing strategy for CAVs? B: With increasingly more CAVs introduced each adopting the ego-efficient lane-changing strategy, what is the impact on traffic flow? C: How to determine a system-efficient lane-changing strategy for CAVs? These forward-looking issues are addressed from the perspectives of microscopic traffic simulation and reinforcement learning. Without any constraint on the lane-changing incentive, the developed lane-changing strategy was found to be beneficial for CAVs and the entire traffic flow only if the market penetration rate (MPR) of CAVs is less than 50\%. With an appropriate constraint placed, however, the lane-changing strategy was found to become consistently beneficial for the entire traffic flow at any MPR. These findings suggest that CAVs may not simply be a magic cure for traffic problems that the society is currently facing, unless some upper-level coordination may be proposed for CAVs to benefit not only themselves but also the entire traffic. This is also consistent with what “Tragedy of the Commons” suggests.}

In particular, we take advantage of the trip chaining model to integrate multi-source public transportation data to construct a knowledge graph. A contact network is then extracted from the constructed knowledge graph, and a breadth-first search algorithm is developed to efficiently trace infected passengers in the contact network. The proposed framework and algorithms are validated by a case study using smart card transaction data from transit systems in Xiamen, China.

abstract = {This paper proposes a physics-informed reinforcement learning(RL)-based ramp metering strategy, which trains the RL model using a combination of historic data and synthetic data generated from a traffic flow model. The optimal policy of the RL model is updated through an iterative training process, where in each iteration a new batch of historic data is collected and fed into the training data set. Such iterative training process can evaluate the control policy from reality rather than from a simulator, thus avoiding the RL model being trapped in an inaccurate training environment. The proposed strategy is applied to both local and coordinated ramp metering. Results from extensive microscopic simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed strategy (i) significantly improves the traffic performance in terms of total time spent savings; (ii) outperforms classical feedback-based ramp metering strategies; and (iii) achieves higher improvements than an existing RL-based ramp metering strategy, which trains the RL model merely by a simulator. We also test the performance of two different learning algorithms in the simulation experiment, namely a conventional tabular approach and a batch-constrained deep RL approach. It is found that the deep RL approach is not as effective as the conventional tabular approach in the proposed strategy due to the limited amount of training data.}

abstract = {Modern airports often have large and complex airside environments featuring multiple runways, with changing configurations, numerous taxiways for effective circulation of flights and tens, if not hundreds, of gates. With inherent uncertainties in gate push-back and taxiway routing, efficient surveillance and management of airport-airside operations is a highly challenging task for air traffic controllers. An increase in air traffic may lead to gate delays, taxiway congestion, taxiway incursions as well as significant increase in the workload of air traffic controllers. With the advent of Digital Towers, airports are increasingly being equipped with surveillance camera systems. This paper proposes a novel computer vision framework for airport-airside surveillance, using cameras to monitor ground movement objects for safety enhancement and operational efficiency improvement. The framework adopts Convolutional Neural Networks and camera calibration techniques for aircraft detection and tracking, push-back prediction, and maneuvering monitoring. The proposed framework is applied on video camera feeds from Houston Airport, USA (for maneuvering monitoring) and Obihiro Airport, Japan (for push-back prediction). The object detection models of the proposed framework achieve up to 73.36\% average precision on Houston airport and 87.3\% on Obihiro airport. The framework estimates aircraft speed and distance with low error (up to 6 meters), and aircraft push-back is predicted with an average error of 3 min from the time an aircraft arrives with the error-rate reducing until the aircraft’s actual push-back event.}

abstract = {As an active performance evaluation method, the fluid-based queueing model plays an important role in traffic flow modeling and traffic state estimation problems. A critical challenge in the application of traffic state estimation is how to utilize heterogeneous data sources in identifying key interpretable model parameters of freeway bottlenecks, such as queue discharge rates, system-level bottleneck-oriented arrival rates, and congestion duration. Inspired by Newell’s deterministic fluid approximation model, this paper proposes a spatial queue model for oversaturated traffic systems with time-dependent arrival rates. The oversaturated system dynamics can be described by parsimonious analytical formulations based on polynomial functional approximation for virtual arrival flow rates. With available flow, density and end-to-end travel time data along traffic bottlenecks, the proposed modeling framework for estimating the key traffic queueing state parameters is able to systematically map various measurements to the bottleneck-level dynamics and queue evolution process. The effectiveness of the developed method is demonstrated based on three case studies with empirical data in different metropolitan areas, including New York, Los Angeles, and Beijing.}

The presented problem, two-stage robust facility location problem with drones (two-stage RFLPD), incorporates the demand uncertainty using demand scenarios. This problem aims to find a location–allocation-assignment plan that has minimal two-stage total cost in the worst-case scenario of all the possible demand outcomes. Three different models of the problem are proposed, two of which incorporate a realistic UAV electricity consumption model while the last one has greater operational flexibility. The column-and-constraint generation method and Benders decomposition are used to solve the two models, and a thorough comparison among the deterministic facility location problem with drones (FLPD) models and three proposed models are also presented. Numerical analysis results show that the proposed model has significantly less average cost in the simulation runs compared to the deterministic FLPD.}

abstract = {The planning of attractive and cost efficient public transport schedules, i.e., timetables and corresponding vehicle schedules is a highly complex optimization process involving many steps. Integrating robustness from a passenger’s point of view makes the task even more challenging. With numerous different definitions of robustness in the literature, a standard way to evaluate the robustness of a public transport system is to simulate its performance under a large number of possible scenarios. Unfortunately, this is computationally very expensive. In this paper, we therefore explore a new way of such a scenario-based robustness approximation by using regression models from machine learning. Training of these models is based on carefully selected key features of public transport systems and passenger demand. The trained model is then able to predict the robustness of untrained instances with high accuracy using only its key features, allowing for a robustness oracle for transport planners that approximates the robustness in constant time. Such an oracle can be used as black box to increase the robustness of public transport schedules. We provide a first proof of concept for the special case of robust timetabling, using a local search framework. In computational experiments with different benchmark instances we demonstrate an excellent quality of our predictions.}

Meanwhile, smart cards (SC) gather all transit passenger time-space movements on a daily basis, which represent trip chain attributes. However, qualitative attributes such as sociodemographic attributes and trip purpose are unknown. This study proposed a novel method to estimate the trip purpose and sociodemographic attributes of SC data by using a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN). With an efficient network structure that considers the spatial and sequential dependencies of a trip chain, the proposed CGAN is able to impute the sociodemographic attributes and trip purpose of SC data by mimicking the TDS data using adversarial training. Also, unlike the other generative models, the proposed CGAN can fully leverage the large-scale SC data in training, which allow sidestepping overfit to the TDS data. Evaluation results show that CGAN outperforms other generative models, i.e., Bayesian networks, Gibbs sampler, conventional CGAN, and a conditional variational autoencoder. Considerable performance improvement was achieved by both network structure that can consider spatial and sequential dependencies, and modeling framework that utilize the large-scale SC data. Several metrics were employed to evaluate fidelity, diversity, and creativity, and these verified that the existing generative models tend to overfit the marginal or bivariate distributions of training data. The proposed method addresses the incompleteness of passively collected mobile data. The imputed SC data representing comprehensive travel attributes is valuable for an activity-based model and behavior analysis, because it provides travel information that is more dynamic, continuous, and extensive.}

In addition, an optimization algorithm is presented to empirically identify the proposed model. The proposed model provides a solid theoretical foundation for the machine learning method, substantially improves prediction performance, and provides richer behavioral implications through empirical parameter estimation of travel impedance. We conducted a case study using public transit smart card data. The results showed that the proposed model improves the prediction performance and interpretability of the results compared to the conventional nonnegative Tucker decomposition technique. Further, we empirically confirmed that the travel impedance varies with the origin–destination pair, time of the day, and day of the week. Finally, we discussed how embedding the theoretical foundations of transport modeling into machine learning methods can facilitate the use of various passive data in wider practical contexts of transport policy decision making.}

Given that national and global economies depend upon efficient supply chains, port stakeholders must develop security plans to respond to all hazards, natural and manmade. Given recent cyber-attacks affecting shipping ports, along with the multi-billion dollar cyber insurance gap, ports need to understand the tradeoffs between increased competitiveness and higher risk through investment in automation and advanced logistics technologies. This article addresses the need to understand the economic impact of cyber-attacks that affect shipping port operations and thereby enable risk assessments that holistically evaluate interactions among port Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems. Using a Nearly-Orthogonal Latin Hypercube (NOLH) experimental design, we construct transportation disruption profiles based on actual cyber-attacks that specify the range of operational effects of IT/OT dependencies on stakeholder transportation assets. To capture the costs of the physical disruption, we extend Boland et al’s Dynamic Discretization Discovery (DDD) algorithm to capture capacity constraints and enable delay modeling to accommodate commodities arriving late due to disruption. Economic loss functions for seven commodity categories based on the willingness to pay literature are used to compute delay costs so that stakeholders can estimate the range of economic and operational impacts within a disruption profile. Results based on data for cyber-attacks on landlord port and terminal operator assets provided by Port Everglades, FL illustrate impacts at \$80,000 and \$1.2M on average during one week in October 2017 and at \$141,000 and \$2.8M for May 2017 respectively. The runtime performance of our enhanced DDD algorithm improves on the state of the art by an order of magnitude and on larger problem sizes based on real-world port networks.}

The objective of this paper is to systematically evaluate trip identification algorithms in the literature and provide recommendations to improve performance for walking and cycling trips. Fourteen algorithms are applied to 1685 GPS trajectories from Vancouver, Canada, and evaluated on the bases of their agreement, distinction of trip and activity data characteristics, processing time, and accuracy (based on a labeled subset). Error sources are identified in relationship to trajectory, network, and weather factors. Results indicate poor concordance and widely varying performance, with no algorithm best across all measures. Four high-performing algorithms are identified with at least 90\% record-level accuracy; other considerations include accuracy of the inferred number and duration of trips, precision of identified trip end points, and computational resource requirements. Density is a key variable for trip identification in the best-performing algorithms. Proximity to tree canopy, buildings, bridges, and tunnels affects the accuracy of some algorithms more than others. Most algorithms err almost entirely with false trips or false activities, which is a bias of concern for analysis. The importance of trip identification decisions should motivate more thorough reporting to enhance reproducibility and reliability.}

MFD is a powerful and efficient model for monitoring and managing large-scale urban networks. However, estimating the MFD for large-scale networks faces important challenges; monitoring resources are often limited in such networks. Furthermore, common sensors that are used to collect traffic data (i.e., loop detectors and probe vehicles), have limitations of their own. For instance, loop detectors are fixed sensors and cannot provide accurate density measurements. On the other hand, to estimate the MFD using probe vehicle data, the probe penetration rate must be known a priori. Given that the individual sensors cannot provide complete and accurate traffic measurements, combining the traffic data from multiple sources may improve the estimation of the MFD. The aim of this study is to combine two traffic data sources to estimate the MFD for a large-scale urban network, where the distribution of probe vehicles across the network is not necessarily homogeneous. The two traffic data sets used in this study are probe vehicle data with an unknown penetration rate, and full-scale approximate traffic data which is produced based on loop detector data. We compare the results of the fusion method with the results of a baseline method, which only uses loop detector measurements. The average flow and density estimations resulting from the Bayesian fusion method outperform the baseline method. We observe a particularly significant improvement in average density estimations, which reaffirms that loop detectors cannot accurately measure the average density.}

Although recent versions of automotive navigation systems help users minimize their travel time, there are certain situations in which the shortest route is not necessarily the safest one. Navigating through local roads that carry higher risks of crashes—roads with poor geometric designs, drainage problems, lack of illumination, wildlife crossing danger, and interruptions in traffic flow—is an example of the unintended consequences of routing to ensure minimum travel time. This study is designed to examine the safety of the fastest routes suggested by navigation systems. Road network connecting five metropolitan areas in Texas, including more than 29,000 road segments, is studied. The results of comparing the safest and shortest route between pairs of origins and destinations showed that the shortest route can differ from the safest, where taking a route to decrease travel time by 8\% was associated with a 23\% higher risk of being involved in a crash. The findings indicate the safest route varies according to different weather conditions. To incorporate safety in route-finding, a centralized, predictive algorithm is introduced for static and dynamic safe route-finding that can complement the existing navigation systems. The requirements for implementing such a system are identified as: (1) availability of real-time traffic flow and incident data for dynamic route-finding systems, (2) more accurate crash prediction models, and (3) a methodology for dealing with the tradeoffs between travel time and safety to find the optimal route.}

An econometric model is presented to identify the major determinants of influencing drivers’ time for completing the parking process at a parking space and their parking choice decisions towards the women-only parking spaces. Optimization models are developed to jointly determine the optimal proportion of the women-only parking spaces in a parking lot and/or the optimal parking fees so as to maximize the total net profit of operator, which is from the operations of car park and shopping mall. A case study from Wuhan China is conducted for illustrating the applications of the models. The findings show that driver’s gender, driving age, vehicle length, and parking environment (obstacles on one or both sides of a parking space) have significant impacts on the time for completing the parking process at a parking space. Women-only parking spaces can help reduce such time. Driver’s gender, driving age, and the past parking experience at the women-only parking spaces significantly influence driver’s choice of the women-only parking spaces, whereas educational degree and the past parking experience have no statistically significanteffects. However, investment in the women-only parking spaces may lead to a loss in the net profit of operator, and thus the investment decision on the women-only parking spaces should be carefully made for the operator in practice. These findings have important implications for planning of parking facilities and evaluation of parking policies.}

The most commonly known disadvantage of the approach is the “black box” nature. This study, to improve the interpretability, proposed a novel method for identifying lane changes. The philosophy was to measure the similarity of the glance behavior during the maneuver. The glance behavior in the same maneuver is more similar, while that in different maneuvers is different. First, a driving simulator was used to collect driving behavior data. The eye gaze time series were captured by the eye tracker. The median of the eye gaze sequence of 3 s before the initial moment of lane change was obtained. With the median as the center, the driver's visual field plane was divided into several grids with the side length of 600 pixels. A sliding space-time cuboid algorithm was proposed to extract the scanning path. Second, four-dimensional dynamic time warping (4DDTW) distance was used to measure the similarity of the scanning paths. Third, the K nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm was used to classify the driving maneuver into the lane-keeping (LK), the right lane change (RLC), and the left lane change (LLC) based on the 4DDTW distance of the scan paths. LSTM was also used to classify the driving maneuver into LK, RLC, and LLC. The performances of 4DDTW-KNN and LSTM were compared. The accuracies of 4DDTW-KNN and LSTM were 86.50\% and 86.33\%, respectively. LSTM is not better than 4DDTW-KNN in lane change identification based on eye gaze data with a comprehensive consideration of the time efficiency, the accuracy and the interpretability.}

Although most researchers use closed-ended surveys, the appropriate method to measure attitudes is debatable. Topic Modeling could significantly reduce the time to extract information from open-ended responses and eliminate subjective bias, thereby alleviating analyst concerns. Our research uses Topic Modeling to extract information from open-ended questions and compare its performance with closed-ended responses. Furthermore, some respondents might prefer answering questions using their preferred questionnaire type. So, we propose a modeling framework that allows respondents to use their preferred questionnaire type to answer the survey and enable analysts to use the modeling frameworks of their choice to predict behavior. We demonstrate this using a dataset collected from the USA that measures the intention to use Autonomous Vehicles for commute trips. Respondents were presented with alternative questionnaire versions (open- and closed-ended). Since our objective was also to compare the performance of alternative questionnaire versions, the survey was designed to eliminate influences resulting from statements, behavioral framework, and the choice experiment. Results indicate the suitability of using Topic Modeling to extract information from open-ended responses; however, the models estimated using the closed-ended questions perform better compared to them. Besides, the proposed model performs better compared to the models used currently. Furthermore, our proposed framework will allow respondents to choose the questionnaire type to answer, which could be particularly beneficial to them when using voice-based surveys.}

The results show that the trajectories of the real and estimated flows and density are very close, showing the good performance of the proposed methods.}

abstract = {Ridesourcing platforms have acquired an important role as an alternative travel mode in almost all major cities in the world. These new mobility applications offer benefits for users over traditional taxi and public transport alternatives. However, there is mounting evidence that ridesourcing worsens traffic congestion. Given this potential negative impact and the complicated relationship between travel modes, it is unclear how policymakers should respond to the appearance of this new transport option. In this paper, we present a social welfare maximization model with four modes (automobile, taxi, buses and ridesourcing services) to derive the optimal first-best and second-best fares, considering the congestion externality generated by each mode. We apply this model to Santiago, Chile, using available parameter estimates to derive optimal fares with a novel inverse demand system (Inverse Product Differentiation Logit model). The results indicate that ridesourcing fares should be 29\% higher per ride in the first-best scenario and 59\% higher in the second-best scenario compared to current levels. However, our second-best scenario (in which buses and taxis have fares given by current levels and there is no congestion pricing for cars) reaches only 18\% of the welfare gains from a first-best scenario. Sensitivity analysis shows that these results are not sensitive to several key assumptions, however they are sensitive to the parametrization of the flow-delay function in the second-best scenario. Our simulations also show that the optimal surcharge should be slightly higher if the average occupancy rate for ridesourcing services increases. This result is due to the higher overall use of this service, as the average fare per passenger decreases when more passengers ride together.}

To mitigate the negative effect of traffic lights on eco-driving control of electric vehicles, a multi-intersections-based eco-approach and departure strategy (M-EAD) is proposed to improve vehicle energy efficiency, traffic throughput, and battery life, while maintaining acceptable driving comfort. M-EAD is a two-stage control scheme that includes efficient green signal window planning and speed trajectory optimization. In the upper stage, the traffic light green signal window planning is formulated as a shortest path problem, which is solved using an A* algorithm for travel delay reduction. In the lower stage, the speed optimization problem is solved by resorting to a receding horizon framework, in which the energy consumption and battery life losses are minimized using an iterative dynamic programming algorithm. Finally, Monte Carlo simulation with randomized traffic signal parameters is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed M-EAD strategy. The results show the various advancements of the proposed M-EAD strategy over two benchmark methods, constant speed and isolated-intersection-based eco-approach and departure strategies in terms of energy efficiency, travel time, and battery life in stochastic traffic scenarios. In addition, the performance of M-EAD on actual road conditions is validated by on-road vehicle test.}

Flexible time series analysis is obtained by modeling the probability of edges between vertices through latent Gaussian processes. The models and Bayesian inference are illustrated on a sample of 10-year data from four major airlines within the US air transportation system. Results show how the estimated latent parameters from the models are related to the airlines’ connectivity dynamics, and their ability to project the multilayer graph into the future for out-of-sample full network forecasts, while stochastic blockmodeling allows for the identification of relevant communities.

This paper considers shared parking services for ride-sourcing vehicles to reduce the cruising traffic. We propose a novel business model that integrates shared parking services into the ride-sourcing platform. In the proposed business model, the platform (a) provides app-based interfaces to connect passengers, drivers and garage operators (private or commercial garages); (b) matches passengers to ride-sourcing vehicles for ride services; (c) matches idle vehicles to vacant parking spaces to reduce cruising traffic; and (d) determines the ride fare, driver payment, and parking rates to maximize its profit. We model the integrated platform as a three-sided market (i.e., passenger, driver and garage) that involves two matching processes: passenger-driver matching and driver-garage matching. An economic equilibrium model is proposed to characterize the incentives of passengers, drivers, garage operators, and the ride-sourcing platform. Optimal pricing strategies and the corresponding market outcomes are derived by solving the platform’s profit maximization problem. Based on the model, we show that integrated parking and ride-sourcing service can offer a Pareto improvement: in certain regime, it leads to higher passenger surplus, higher driver surplus, higher garage surplus, higher platform profit, and reduced cruising traffic. Further, we investigate the impacts of matching efficiency between drivers and garages on the proposed business model. We show that a higher matching efficiency always leads to increased platform profit and driver surplus, but it may not necessarily benefit passengers or garage operators in all cases. The above insights are validated through realistic numerical studies for San Francisco.}

abstract = {Since sailing along the Northern Sea Route (NSR) through the Arctic Ocean comes into reality, commercial shipping developments including opening new liner services along this route have been put on the agenda. However, uncertainties within weather and ocean conditions in this region, especially during temperature-varying seasons, may cause failure to on-time arrivals, resulting unignorable or even unaffordable monetary losses. As a result, these uncertainties will inevitably affect cargo shippers’ willingness of choosing this being-explored route, even if on average its shipping time is much shorter than that of the traditional Asia-Europe shipping lines. In this context, the present paper describes a liner ship routing and scheduling problem considering schedule-sensitive demand and late-arrival penalty for operating incoming NSR shipping lines in the future. By using two types of uncertainty sets, bounded and budget-bounded uncertainty sets, we construct and solve two robust counterparts of this problem. The deterministic model and bounded robust model can be seen as special cases of the budget-bounded robust model when the uncertainty budget is set to null and full, respectively. A multifaceted case study of planning liner shipping routes and schedules along the NSR is conducted to validate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed models and identify the effects of uncertainty bounds and budgets on the solution performance. The following facts and conclusions are revealed from the optimization results of the case study: The budget-bounded robust model functions the best in the worst condition; low revenue rate and high demand sensitivity are the major factors for excluding a candidate port from the route; the order of a visited port in the route decides the weight of its uncertainty budget on the entire shipping line; setting the uncertainty budget in a decelerative way will enhance the scheduling robustness of solutions.}

Such a paradigm can assist policymakers in devising optimal operational and planning countermeasures under both normal and abnormal circumstances. To this end, we develop a Markov routing game (MRG) in which each agent learns and updates her own en-route path choice policy while interacting with others in transportation networks. To efficiently solve MRG, we formulate it as multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and devise a mean field multi-agent deep Q learning (MF-MA-DQL) approach that captures the competition among agents. The linkage between the classical DUE paradigm and our proposed Markov routing game (MRG) is discussed. We show that the routing behavior of intelligent agents is shown to converge to the classical notion of predictive dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) when traffic environments are simulated using dynamic loading models (DNL). In other words, the MRG depicts DUEs assuming perfect information and deterministic environments propagated by DNL models. Four examples are solved to illustrate the algorithm efficiency and consistency between DUE and the MRG equilibrium, on a simple network without and with spillback, the Ortuzar Willumsen (OW) Network, and a real-world network near Columbia University’s campus in Manhattan of New York City.}

In order to protect such vulnerable road users from collisions, it is necessary to handle possible conflict in advance and warn road users, not post-facto. A breakthrough for proactively preventing pedestrian collisions is to recognize pedestrian’s potential risks based on vision sensors such as CCTVs. In this study, we propose a predictive collision risk area estimation system at unsignalized crosswalks. The proposed system applied trajectories of vehicles and pedestrians from video footage after preprocessing, and then predicted their trajectories by using deep LSTM networks. With use of predicted trajectories, this system can infer collision risk areas statistically, further severity of levels is divided as danger, warning, and caution. In order to validate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed system, we applied it and assessed the severity of potential risks in two unsignalized spots with different mobility environment in Osan City, Republic of Korea. As a result, the ratio of dangerous scenes is higher in Spot A (0.115) than in Spot B (0.077) when applying the best performance model in each spot, and we found that the risk situation varies depending on the mobility environment.}

Furthermore, the required controller transitions are designed such that the switch between regular platooning and the merging maneuver can easily be made by all vehicles. The proposed strategy is validated using simulations. In the simulation environment communication delays, sensor noise, and disturbances of the platoon leader have been included.

In the new scenario-based DMPC approach, uncertainties in a large-scale freeway network are distinguished into two categories: global uncertainties for the overall network and local uncertainties applicable to subnetworks only. We propose to use a reduced scenario tree instead of using a complete scenario tree. A complete scenario tree is defined as a scenario tree consisting of global scenarios and all the combinations of the local scenarios for all subnetworks, while a reduced scenario tree is defined as a scenario tree consisting of global scenarios and a reduced local scenario tree in which local scenarios are combined within each subnetwork, not among subnetworks. Moreover, an expected-value setting and a min–max setting are considered for handling uncertainties in scenario-based DMPC. In the expected-value setting, the expected-value of the cost function values for all considered uncertainty scenarios is optimized by scenario-based DMPC. However, in the min–max setting, the worst-case of the cost function values for all considered uncertainty scenarios is optimized by scenario-based DMPC. The results for a numerical experiment show that the new scenario-based DMPC approach is effective in improving the control performance while at the same time satisfying the queue constraints in the presence of uncertainties. Additionally, the proposed approach results in a relatively low computational burden compared to the case with the complete scenario tree.}

We present a joint model of consumers’ affinity towards shared automated vehicles (SAVs) with two distinct yet related configurations: automated vehicle (AV) carsharing and AV ride sourcing. Compact and walkable built environment is known to support active travel and shared mobility but the potential impacts of built environment on adoption of automated shared mobility are largely unknown. Besides sociodemographic, sustainable travel, and technology-related factors, we examine the role of neighborhood-level walkability (composite measure of land-use, pedestrian-oriented urban design, and transit accessibility) in shaping public’s opinion about AV carsharing and AV ride sourcing technologies. Detailed travel behavior and stated preference/taste data for over 2700 individuals from the most recent 2019 Puget Sound Travel Survey are complemented with neighborhood-level high-resolution data on built environment fabric. Two dependent variables of interest include individual’s level of interest in AV carsharing and AV ride sourcing programs. A novel and comprehensive geo-additive heterogeneous copula-based joint behavioral model is developed - revealing complex stochastic dependence patterns between users’ interest in AV ride sourcing and carsharing programs and different layers of systematic and random taste heterogeneity. Results show that improving neighborhood walkability can be an effective way to increase public’s interest in using automated ride sourcing and carsharing services. Findings also highlight the opportunity to enable SAV adoption by harnessing the synergies between green (transit) travel, technology use for work/non-work purposes, use of existing mobility-on-demand (MOD) services, and affinity towards automated MOD services. Results are translated to potential policies for designing proactive behavioral and built environment interventions for accelerating SAV adoption with an enhanced sensitivity towards the needs of distinct and more vulnerable population groups (e.g., older, unemployed, and/or less educated individuals). The study methodologically contributes by presenting a comprehensive behavioral model for SAV adoption by differentiating ride sourcing and carsharing.}

abstract = {With the emergence of innovations associated with public transport (PT) services, such as Mobility-as-a-Service, demand responsive transit, and autonomous vehicles, the door-to-door PT journey is achievable via multiple transfers between and within different PT modes. As such, seamless transfers between different modes of public transportation become an increasingly important factor for the attractiveness of PT services. At the same time, recent developments in travel time prediction methodologies offer new, reliable data sources for the optimization of PT operations. This work, with the consideration of these two elements, develops a mixed integer linear programming model for the PT schedule synchronization problem. The novelty is threefold. First, a novel concept of path-oriented scheduling is proposed. The path transfer time is explicitly formulated and minimized to provide a seamless travel experience considering that the emerging multimodal mobility inevitably induces multiple transfers. Second, time-dependent travel time data is also utilized in the model, which allows us to harness new and more representative data sources for improving PT services. Third, in order to complement the increase in computational complexity as a result of the utilization of time-dependent travel time data, three novel valid inequalities (VIs) are derived. Numerical studies show that the use of time-dependent travel time data is beneficial in terms of reducing path transfer times, when compared to using the mean historical travel times. The numerical study also reveals a tradeoff between the maximum allowable path transfer time and trip time. Using simulation studies on three bus lines in Copenhagen, we demonstrate that the valid inequalities could reduce the computation time by 8.5\% on average, where the maximum reduction of computation time could reach 54.0\%. The proposed valid inequalities are benchmarked against two classes of valid inequalities in the literature. It is found that the proposed valid inequalities could outperform those in the literature. We also found that further improvement in computational performance can be attained by using a combination of the proposed valid inequalities.}

We find that even in a unique market like Singapore, where incumbent taxi companies have app-based booking systems similar to those from ride-hailing companies like Uber, the estimated upper bound on the cross-platform substitution between ride-hailing services and taxi bookings is only 0.26. On the other hand, we show that incorporating surge price factor improves the precision of demand prediction by 12\% to 15\%. Our structural analyses based on a driver guidance system finds this improved accuracy in demand prediction reduces drivers’ vacant roaming times by 9.4\% and increases the average number of trips per taxi by 2.6\%, suggesting the price information is valuable across platforms, even if elasticities are low.}

This study aims to optimize Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for phone usage detection based on vehicle dynamics sensor data from Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study (SH-NDS), China.

Their mean, standard deviation, and predicted error (PE) were calculated, and derived 15 indicators. A Bidirectional layer and attention mechanism were added to the LSTM model for higher accuracy. Results showed that besides the mean and standard deviation of steering wheel rate, all the other 13 indicators were significant and effective in the model. The Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model reached a promising result of approximately 91.2\% accuracy using 5-fold cross validation, which was better than other machine learning methods such as recurrent neural network, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, and adaptive boosting. This Bi-LSTM model with attention mechanism could potentially be applied in advanced driving assistant systems to warn driver and reduce phone involved distracted driving.}

This paper contributes to this knowledge gap by examining the regional/metropolitan dimension in the factors influencing the frequency of ride-hailing use and the demand for pooled and autonomous vehicle (AV) rides in Australia. Through individual-level survey data, we found that there is indeed a divide between factors affecting not only the frequency of using ride-hailing in the status quo but also in the future adoption of new services of pooled and AV-based services. Using the hybrid discrete choice model, we identify several latent psychological constructs that influence the use of ride-hailing services, namely being pro-technology, pro-pooling, pro-AV, anti-driving and security-cautious traits. Moreover, the results of multivariate models point to different observed and latent characteristics influencing the adoption of pooled and AV ride-hailing services for various trip purposes. In line with the literature, it was found that the socio-demographic characteristics that affect the frequency of use or adopting pooled and AV services in future include gender, age, income, education attainment, employment status, car ownership, and the current travel behaviour. We also found that ride-hailing in Australia has played more as a substitution role for public transport, private car and taxi than as a complementary role or feeder of the public transport system, both in the metropolitan and regional areas.}

In current research, the design of flow corridor networks cannot capture either the dynamic nature of traffic or the uncertainty in demand variations, which may fail to ensure satisfactory efficiency and reliability. In order to propose more efficient and reliable flow corridor networks for practice operations, this paper is devoted to propose a data-driven framework for the robust generation of time-varying flow corridor networks under demand uncertainty. Specifically, a delay-based method is proposed firstly for optimal design of a static flow corridors network which could be more effective in absorbing frequent flight delays from today’s air transportation system. Next, a multi-objective combinational optimization model is presented with its fast approximate evolutionary algorithm for generating time-varying flow corridor networks. Finally, to handle uncertainties in traffic operations over time, the data-driven Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) approach is employed to ensure the efficiency and reliability of the proposed networks. The framework is applied to the Chinese airspace to design a robust national-wide time-varying flow corridor network for numerical test. The numerical test results confirm that the proposed time-varying networks outperform previous designs in the average alleviated delays, average occupancy, and activation time with only a small trade-off in the number of served flights.}

One strategy to help manage the amount of dockless bikes scattered within a service area is to offer monetary rewards for users who would be willing to pick up bikes scattered around some central location or to return their bikes at this central location. We develop a modeling framework to analyze the effectiveness of using dynamic incentive schemes for balancing the amount of bikes in the system to minimize the expected operating cost. Using an extensive set of numerical experiments, we illustrate specific operation environments under which these dynamic incentive schemes would be most effective for reducing the operating cost of the system. We find that the use of dynamic pickup and return rewards can generate very substantial cost reductions in an operating environment with a high traffic intensity of bike return outside the central location and a high overall traffic intensity of bike returns relative to bike pickups in the system. We also find that return rewards are generally more cost-effective than pickup rewards.}

The majority of research has been devoted to improving the search ability of multi-path algorithms. However, a few investigations focus on simplifying the network, and the research with a rigorous methodology is in early childhood. This study proposes a novel multi-path algorithm with compression network space to search the multiple paths. First, a bi-layer transformation operator is developed to streamline the topology structure of the rail network. Specifically, a first-layer transformation operator employs the station extraction function to simplify the type of stations. After that, a second-layer transformation operator with a path filter function is designed to eliminate the non-effective connection structure. Therefore, a streamlined hierarchical topology network (SHTN) is generated. Sequentially, for the four types of Origin–Destination pairs (ODs), K-shortest paths between an ODs are found by executing four matching mechanisms and the modified Yen’s algorithm. Finally, to verify the effectiveness and efficiency, a series of experiments run on the selected Beijing rail network. The results show that the proposed algorithm has obvious superiority or competitiveness over state-of-the-art algorithms.}

While connected vehicle-enabled technologies, such as coordinated cruise control, can improve vehicle motion planning by incorporating information beyond the line of sight of vehicles, their benefits are limited by the current short-sighted planning strategies that only utilize local information. In this paper, we propose a framework that devises vehicle trajectories by coupling a locally-optimal motion planner with a Markov decision process (MDP) model that can capture network-level information. Our proposed framework can guarantee safety while minimizing a trip’s generalized cost, which comprises of its fuel and time costs. To showcase the benefits of incorporating network-level data when devising vehicle trajectories, we conduct a comprehensive simulation study in three experimental settings, namely a circular track, a highway with on- and off-ramps, and a small urban network. The simulation results indicate that statistically significant efficiency can be obtained for the subject vehicle and its surrounding vehicles in different traffic states under all experimental settings. This paper serves as a proof-of-concept to showcase how connectivity and autonomy can be leveraged to incorporate network-level information into motion planning.}

abstract = {With the popularization of transportation network companies (TNCs) (e.g., Uber, Lyft) and the rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs), even major car manufacturers are increasingly considering themselves as autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) providers rather than individual vehicle sellers. However, matching the convenience of owning a vehicle requires providing consistent service quality, taking into account individual expectations. Typically, different classes of users have different service quality (SQ) expectations in terms of responsiveness, reliability, and privacy. Nonetheless, AMoD systems presented in the literature do not enable active control of service quality in the short term, especially in light of unusual demand patterns, sometimes allowing extensive delays and user rejections. This study proposes a method to control the daily operations of an AMoD system that uses the SQ expectations of heterogeneous user classes to dynamically distribute service quality among riders. Additionally, we consider an elastic vehicle supply, that is, privately-owned freelance AVs (FAVs) can be hired on short notice to help providers meeting user service-level expectations. We formalize the problem as the dial-a-ride problem with service quality contracts (DARP-SQC) and propose a multi-objective matheuristic to address real-world requests from Manhattan, New York City. Applying the proposed service-level constraints, we improve user satisfaction (in terms of reached service-level expectations) by 53\% on average compared to conventional ridesharing systems, even without hiring additional vehicles. By deploying service-quality-oriented on-demand hiring, our hierarchical optimization approach allows providers to adequately cater to each segment of the customer base without necessarily owning large fleets.}

Few of the existing studies looks into the problem of controlling vehicles to drive on their desired lanes. This paper proposes a formation control method that considers vehicles’ preference on different lanes. A bi-level formation control framework is utilized to plan collision-free motion for vehicles, where relative target assignment and path planning are performed in the upper level, and trajectory planning and tracking are performed in the lower level. The collision-free multi-vehicle path planning problem considering lane preference is decoupled into two sub problems: calculating assignment list with non-decreasing cost and planning collision-free paths according to given assignment result. The Conflict-based Searching (CBS) method is utilized to plan collision-free paths for vehicles based on given assignment results. Case study is conducted and simulations are carried out in a three-lane road scenario. The results indicate that the proposed formation control method significantly reduces congestion and improves traffic efficiency at high traffic volumes, compared to the rule-based method.}

Although most scholars determined OD demand after deriving unique route flow based on AVI sensors, this traditional method does not necessarily obtain the smallest number of sensors to ensure the uniqueness of OD demand. Moreover, the sensors can fail in reality, which results in missing some information of observed links, thus the uniqueness of OD demand cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, we propose a new AVI sensor location model considering sensor failures to ensure the uniqueness of OD demand directly, without determining route flows. Typically, given the observation order of AVI sensors, this method can minimize the number of sensors to determine OD demand uniquely, in the meanwhile satisfying certain reliability given sensors’ failure. Moreover, under budget constraints, we develop a sensor location model to estimate OD demand under sensor failures, which maximizes information value of the differentiated OD pairs. Then we design several greedy heuristic algorithms to solve these two sensor location problems. Through numerical experiments, we show that the proposed models and algorithms can effectively determine the AVI sensor locations to recognize the OD demand and its uniqueness in the event of uncertain sensor failures.}

Gaussian Processes (GPs) are kernel-based algorithms that incorporate expert knowledge by assuming priors over latent functions rather than priors over parameters, which makes them more flexible in addressing nonlinear problems. By integrating a Gaussian Process within a LCCM structure, we aim at improving discrete representations of unobserved heterogeneity. The proposed model would assign individuals probabilistically to behaviorally homogeneous clusters (latent classes) using GPs and simultaneously estimate class-specific choice models by relying on random utility models. Furthermore, we derive and implement an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to jointly estimate/infer the hyperparameters of the GP kernel function and the class-specific choice parameters by relying on a Laplace approximation and gradient-based numerical optimization methods, respectively. The model is tested on two different mode choice applications and compared against different LCCM benchmarks. Results show that GP-LCCM allows for a more complex and flexible representation of heterogeneity and improves both in-sample fit and out-of-sample predictive power. Moreover, behavioral and economic interpretability is maintained at the class-specific choice model level while local interpretation of the latent classes can still be achieved, although the non-parametric characteristic of GPs lessens the transparency of the model.}

We propose an analytical model that establishes a quantitative relationship between the ratio of collected trajectory points to total traffic trajectory points (RCT) and the IV penetration rate, according to stochastic geometry theory. With this, the data-collection efficiency (DCE) of IVs can be effectively evaluated. A simulation approach is developed to generate IV data and thereby validate the proposed analytical model, using a comprehensive set of traffic scenarios; these data consist of eight micro-trajectory datasets from the next-generation simulation (NGSIM) program and four typical sensor IV deployments. The numerical analysis demonstrates that the model perfectly reflects the simulated IV data for all traffic scenarios. In addition, an analytical comparison of the DCEs for fixed sensors, probe vehicles, and IVs reveals that IVs are the most efficient method for collecting traffic data in road networks. This study proposes a theory to predict the percentage of trajectory points that can be collected by a certain percentage of IVs within the entire traffic flow.}

In the big data era, massive heavy truck GPS trajectories can be acquired cost effectively in real-time. Identifying freight trip ends (origins and destinations) from heavy truck GPS trajectories is an outstanding problem. Although previous studies proposed a variety of trip end identification methods from different perspectives, these studies subjectively defined key threshold parameters and ignored the complex intracity heavy truck travel characteristics. Here, we propose a data-driven trip end identification method in which the speed threshold for identifying truck stops and the multilevel time thresholds for distinguishing temporary stops and freight trip ends are objectively defined. Moreover, an appropriate time threshold level is dynamically selected by considering the intracity activity patterns of heavy trucks. Furthermore, we use urban road networks and Point-of-Interest (POI) data to eliminate long-stay temporary stops to improve method accuracy. The validation results show that the accuracy of the method we propose is 88.79\%. Our method incorporates the impact of the city freight context on truck trajectory characteristics, and its results can reflect the spatial distribution and chain patterns of intracity heavy truck freight trips, which have a wide range of practical applications.}

For this, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is slowly establishing itself as the new state of the art because it can greatly tackle two well known challenges—i.e. problem dimensionality and non-linearity. PCA application limits the optimization search space in a lower dimension space, defined by orthogonal Principal Components, evaluated upon a set of historical estimates. In this paper, we solve practical implementation problems for PCA-based calibration techniques. Specifically, we formulate a data-assimilation framework to propose multiple OD historical data-set generation methods which allows the use of PC-based algorithms in case the historical data is irrelevant or unavailable, often the case for large-scale DTA models. Furthermore, we propose a simplified problem formulation that leverages properties of the novel data-set generation framework and helps for faster and more efficient calibration. The methodology is implemented using the PC-SPSA algorithm, which combines PCA with the popular Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) algorithm, commonly used to calibrate smaller networks. The approach is tested on a large-scale case study of the Munich metropolitan urban network, with encouraging calibration results. The proposed data-assimilation framework can account for spatial, temporal, and day-to-day variations in the demand. Different methods and combinations are tested and compared. The results suggest that all these correlations should be used in order to avoid over-fitting issues. Furthermore, the implementation properties of PCA and PC-SPSA are also explored using different sensitivity analyses to assess the toll and benefits of using PCA i.e., ease in SPSA hyper-parameter, role of historical data-set generation parameters and the algorithm’s performance against different target demand fluctuations. The analysis shows encouraging results for PC-SPSA robustness and helps establishing simplified guidelines for implementing such PCA-methods practically on large-scale DTA models.}

The proposed framework is relied on the metamodel optimization technique, based on the reference of aggregated traffic flow dynamics as expressed by the recent advance in traffic flow theory, namely the bi-modal macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD). We validate our proposed approach with the Stochastic Perturbation Simultaneous Approximation (SPSA) algorithm which is widely used for the same purpose in the literature. Our result confirms that our approach can facilitate the demand calibration effectively. We also show that the traffic conditions at a link level are also reproduced realistically from our network-level calibration, and that our approach outperforms the traditional link-level OD calibration by comparing with the Aimsun OD adjustment in addition to SPSA. Furthermore, we demonstrate via different realistic network studies that the proposed approach is computationally efficient compared to the existing state-of-the-art approach. Our result shows that the proposed approach can be applied effectively regardless of the topology of the network, and that the model parameters do not have significant influence on the optimization results. Our calibration results show that just a few iterations are needed to calibrate the OD demand in the proposed approach even for the large-scale complex network underpinned by a bi-modal MFD derived from multiple real data sources.}

abstract = {This paper analyses how train delays propagate in a metro network due to disturbances and disruptions when different recovery strategies are implemented. Metro regulators use traffic management policies to recover from delays as fast as possible, return to a predefined schedule, or achieve an expected regularity of train arrivals and departures. We use as a metro traffic simulator SIMSTORS, which is based on a Stochastic Petri Net variant and simulates a physical system controlled by traffic management algorithms. To model existing metro networks, SIMSTORS has been mainly used with rule-based traffic management algorithms. In this work, we enhance traffic management strategies. We integrate SIMSTORS and the AGLIBRARY optimization solver in a closed-loop framework. AGLIBRARY is a deterministic solver for managing complex scheduling and routing problems. We formulate the real-time train rescheduling problem by means of alternative graphs, and use the decision procedures of AGLIBRARY to obtain rescheduling solutions. Several operational issues have been investigated throughout the use of the proposed simulation–optimization framework, among which how to design suitable periodic or event-based rescheduling strategies, how to setup the traffic prediction horizon, how to decide the frequency and the length of the optimization process. The Santiago Metro Line 1, in Chile, is used as a practical case study. Experiments with this framework in various settings show that integrating the optimization algorithms provided by AGLIBRARY to the rule-based traffic management embedded in SIMSTORS optimizes performance of the network, both in terms of train delay minimization and service regularity.}

abstract = {This study examines braking behaviour of drivers assisted with driving aids in a connected environment compared to when they are driving without it during failed lane-changing attempts that often exerts more pressure on the immediate follower in the target lane in the form of hard decelerations, which increases crash risk. To achieve this aim, the CARRS-Q Advanced Driving Simulator is utilised, where 78 participants faced a failed-lane-changing attempt of a lane-changer from the adjacent lane into two randomised driving conditions: (a) baseline (without driving aids); and (b) connected environment (with driving aids). A descriptive analysis of braking profiles reveals decreased decelerations among drivers in the connected environment, compared to when they are driving in the baseline condition. To model braking behaviour, more specifically the time taken by drivers to reduce their initial speeds to the minimum speeds, a grouped random parameters hazard-based duration model is developed. Factors found to significantly impact the braking behaviour are initial speed, spacing, maximum deceleration, driving condition, driver age, and gender. The developed model reveals that drivers’ braking times may increase or decrease in the connected environment compared to those in the baseline condition. However, a majority of drivers in the connected environment tend to reduce speeds earlier with a lower deceleration rate, exhibiting smoother speed reductions and larger safety margins. A decision tree analysis reveals that middle-aged and male drivers take longer to reduce their speeds in the baseline condition but shorter in the connected environment. This study concludes that followers in the connected environment respond to failed lane-changing attempts more swiftly, thereby increasing safety margins.}

abstract = {Connected Vehicles (CVs) technology has provided large-scale driving database embedded in Basic Safety Messages (BSMs). This valuable data source can shed more light on tracking individual driving behaviors to detect crashes. This study delves into the possibility of detecting crashes using BSMs in controlled high-fidelity driving simulator experiments. To this end, two driving simulator scenarios were designed to simulate Run-off-Road (ROR), and Rear-End (RE) crashes. Twenty-four professional truck drivers were recruited to drive the scenarios. In each scenario, crash and non-crash cases were identified from vehicles’ trajectories, resulting in four study cases. Drivers’ behaviors were quantified by characterizing two Kinematic-based Surrogate Measures of Safety (K-SMoS), namely Absolute value of Derivative of Instantaneous Acceleration (ADInstAccel) and Absolute value of Derivative of Steering (ADSteering). Extreme defensive driving volatilities under crash and non-crash cases were modeled by extreme value analysis of K-SMoS and fitting their associated Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distributions under Bayesian inference. Accordingly, for each K-SMoS, the crash detection was formulated as a binary classification between two K-SMoS GEV continuous distributions under crash and corresponding non-crash conditions. Qualitative uncertainty analysis of joint posterior density distributions of GEVs’ parameters revealed a higher uncertainty of extreme driving behaviors in crash conditions. Regardless, notable relative increases in the central tendency of extreme K-SMoS in crash compared to non-crash conditions were found, implying the possibility of crash detection by tracking extreme drivers’ behaviors using trajectory-level observations. This visual inference was affirmed by the result of binary classification of GEV distributions associated with K-SMoS. Depending on the crash type and K-SMoS, 71\% to 81\% accuracy in crash detection was obtained, where ADSteering outperformed ADInstAccel in terms of the discriminative ability. Besides, using sensitivity–specificity analysis, the optimal threshold of 1.24 (rad/s) and 1.31 (m/s3), respectively, for ADSteering and ADInstAccel, were identified to detect crashes. These findings can potentially enhance CVs' automation level in spatiotemporally identifying crash-prone conditions to disseminate distress notifications. Furthermore, the introduced methodology can be a complementary one to what has been followed in the crash detection domain.}

First, we use a passenger-centric perspective which introduces traveling classes, and information sharing between transport modes to differentiate quality of services. This helps smooth multimodal journeys and increase passenger satisfaction. Second, we provide a flight routing and recharging solution which minimizes direct operational costs while preserving long term battery life through reduced energy-intense recharging. Our methods, which surpass the performance of a general state-of-the-art commercial solver, are also used to gain meaningful insights on the design space of the air-taxi problem, including solutions to hidden fairness issues.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a new data-driven impact area vulnerability analysis approach that considers both the probability of impact of incidents and their resulting effects on an impact area. Multi-year observed travel time and incident data are deployed to investigate the underlying traffic propagation dynamics. These datasets contain a wealth of information that reflects the occurrences of link closure/disruption by space and time and the network-wide impacts stemming from these disruptions. A novel approach is developed to identify the resulting spatial and temporal impacts of non-recurrent incidents. Rather than focusing solely on the travel time changes of the link subject to incident, this approach captures all aspects of the impacts of incidents by monitoring the dynamic propagation of congestion patterns in the set of links that are in the vicinity of the link subject to incident (i.e., impact area). These spatial and temporal dimensions of the impacts are subsequently used in a new vulnerability analysis. The performance of the developed approach was examined using historical travel time and incident data from the City of Calgary, Canada. The results indicate that the recorded temporal impact of incidents is not representative enough of the true impact of incidents because the dynamic spatial propagation of the effect of incidents on the impact area is overlooked. The proposed approach is capable of capturing the enduring spatiotemporal impact of incidents in a large-scale road network. The primary improvement of the developed vulnerability index is its ability to model multi-dimensional aspects of non-recurrent travel delays caused by non-current incidents in a road network.}

However, most studies have only considered the performance of the passing order at the isolated intersection and have not yet investigated its impact on the road network. In this paper, we will focus on the performance of the passing orders derived from different cooperative driving strategies on the network traffic through a series of simulation experiments. Meanwhile, we will compare the impacts of the passing order at intersections and the car-following gap in straight links on the network traffic efficiency. The experiments results show that the passing order has a dominant impact on the network traffic efficiency, and a better order can significantly raise the curve of the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD); due to the inevitable conflicts in the two-dimensional traffic, the choice of the car-following gap within a reasonable range has a relatively small improvement on the network traffic efficiency. The findings in this paper have instructive significance for the rising research on network-wide cooperative driving and provide a systematical perspective for network traffic control.}

abstract = {Public buses and private vehicles are two main transportation modes for urban road traffic. It has strong flow interactions between the two traffic modes. From data analysis, the vehicle density of a traffic mode not only determine its flow, but also affect the flow of the other mode. With such mixed vehicle flows, the application of traditional traffic management that controls each vehicle flow system separately is limited. Thus, it is beneficial to control both bus and private vehicle flows in an integrated way. Under such bi-modal traffic management, the network efficiency cannot be reflected by vehicle flows since the occupancies of the traffic modes are greatly different. It leads to that the control objective should be necessarily based on passengers. To do so, we adopt bi-modal passenger-based macroscopic fundamental diagram (3D-pMFD) to capture the relations among vehicle accumulations and the total passenger flow in a network. From this aggregate perspective, a passenger-oriented traffic control strategy is proposed by integrating the perimeter control and the regional bus service frequency setting. The characteristics of both traffic modes, especially the operation strategy of buses, are taken into account in the model to describe the bi-modal traffic flow dynamics. A control framework comprised of optimization and simulation is established using model predictive control. The corresponding passenger-based optimization problem is solved by a modified genetic algorithm. With multiple data collected from the network of Shenzhen City in China, numerical experiments are designed to verify the validity and efficiency of the proposed integrated control strategy. Results show that: (1) the proposed strategy can maintain a high level of passenger flow during peak hour with a relatively high demand; (2) the interest of private vehicles is guaranteed even if buses are more recommended in the control strategy; (3) the crowding degree in a bus is reduced properly, which is able to improve the attraction of buses during peak hours; and (4) the proposed passenger-oriented objective results in a comprehensively good performance of the bi-modal network system.}

In the transport system, besides usual transport modes, e.g., private car and public transit, there are two platforms to provide ride-sourcing services, and travelers choose travel modesaccording to their perceived travel costs. Furthermore, the earnings and reservation wages of ride-sourcing car drivers are heterogeneous and follow continuous distributions. We mathematically prove the existence and stability of the stationary point of the model and the equivalence between the stationary point and the equilibrium point. Numerical results show that there may be multiple stationary points in the system, which show a positive correlation characteristic. The evolution trajectories of the system from different initial points may converge to different stationary points, and a lager (smaller) initial number of users using a service platform can result in more (fewer) users and higher (lower) profits of the service platform at the stationary state. When the two platforms provide the same service level to users, setting the same price level may not make their profits simultaneously maximum at the stationary state. The proposed model can be applied to capture the period-to-period dynamics of platform pricings.}

However, they raise a lot of concerns for their impact on congestion, Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT), and competition with transit. There are also questions about their long-term survival because of inherent inefficiencies in their operations. Considering the popularity of the MoD services, increasing ride-pooling is an important means to address these concerns. Shareability depends not only on riders’ attitudes and preferences but also on operating models deployed by providers. The paper introduces an advance requests operating model for ride pooling, users may request rides in advance of their desired departure times. A platform with efficient algorithms for request matching, vehicle routing, rebalancing, and flexible user preferences is developed. Data from Chengdu, China, and New York, United States are used to evaluate the performance of the advance requests system. The impact of various design aspects of the system (e.g. advance requests horizon, vehicle capacity) on its performance is investigated. The sensitivity of the results to user preferences in terms of the level of service (time to be served and excess trip time), willingness to share and place requests in advance, and traffic conditions are explored. The results suggest that significant benefits in terms of sustainability, level of service, and fleet utilization can be realized when advance requests are along with an increased willingness to share. Furthermore, even “near-on-demand” (relative short planning horizons) operations can offer benefits for all stakeholders (users, operators, cities).}

This gives rise to the need for conflict resolution advisory tools that can perform well in high-density traffic scenarios given a noisy environment. Unlike model-based approaches, learning-based approaches can take advantage of historical traffic data and flexibly encapsulate environmental uncertainty. In this study, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that is capable of resolving conflicts, in the presence of traffic and inherent uncertainties in conflict resolution maneuvers, without the need for prior knowledge about a set of rules mapping from conflict scenarios to expected actions. The conflict resolution task is formulated as a decision-making problem in a large and complex action space. The research also includes the development of a learning environment, scenario state representation, reward function, and a reinforcement learning algorithm inspired from Q-learning and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithms. The proposed algorithm, with two stages decision-making process, is used to train an agent that can serves as an advisory tool for air traffic controllers in resolving air traffic conflicts where it can learn from historical data by evolving overtime. Our findings show that the proposed model gives the agent the capability to suggest high quality conflict resolutions under different environmental conditions. It outperforms two baseline algorithms. The trained model has high performance under low uncertainty level (success rate ≥95\% ) and medium uncertainty level (success rate ≥87\%) with high traffic density. The detailed analysis of different impact factors such as environment’s uncertainty and traffic density on learning performance are investigated and discussed. The environment’s uncertainty is the most important factor which affects the performance. Moreover, the combination of high-density traffic and high uncertainty will be the challenge for any learning models.}

Second, the Hurwitz stability region for the derived spacing error propagation transfer function is obtained in a unified stability analysis framework for the time headway and controller gains by utilizing the signature conditions for real polynomials. The robust optimal control problem is formulated as a min–max optimization problem, and then an improved multi-agent based particle swarm optimization algorithm is developed to seek the optimal values of the design parameters in the derived stability region such that a weighted objective function is minimized. Finally, simulation experiments are performed on a numerical example to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design approach.}

This paper investigates the behavioral intention to use AECS using psychological constructs partially from the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) and an additional one expressing safety concern. A novel behavioral intention model is presented to capture the transitional behavioral intention to use two adjacent generations of sharing mobility services. Results of structural equation models applied to a survey sample of 2154 respondents from France, Italy, Netherlands, and Spain show that the introduction of AECS is very likely to be accepted by ECS users. Hedonic motivation is found to be a much stronger predictor of behavioral intention to use AECS as opposed to safety concern, while performance expectancy and social influence are strong drivers of intention to use ECS and have indirect effects on the intention to use AECS. Multigroup analysis indicates heterogeneous behavioral intention across countries. The multi-faceted empirical results generate insights into the deployment and management of AECS in various contexts.}

However, this rapid development in driving automation leads to concerns and questions about their impact on safety. While previous studies have been restricted to incident reports and simulation tools, the safety of automated vehicles (AVs) has not been clearly demonstrated independently from their developers and proponents. Instead of crashes, which are extremely rare events, this study uses surrogate measures of safety (SMoS) to analyze the interactions between road users and low-speed automated shuttles that circulated in Montreal and Candiac, in Canada, during two pilot projects in mid and late 2019. Cameras were placed at seven intersections along the routes of the shuttles. More than 70 hours of footage were processed to extract the road user trajectories using computer vision techniques and compute various safety indicators: speed and acceleration at the road user level, time headway, time-to-collision (TTC), post-encroachment time (PET) and the speed difference at the interaction level. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to compare the distributions of these indicators for interactions involving automated shuttles or motorized vehicles following similar paths. Multivariate regression was used to identify the relationship between the safety indicators and various factors. The results indicate that these automated shuttles behave generally more safely: their speeds and accelerations are lower and their interactions are characterized by higher TTC and PET values, and lower speed differences. However, small headway times at one site with high-speed differences between the shuttles and other following vehicles raise concerns that warrant further research into the suitable context for these vehicles.}

At the same time, to best integrate these emerging modes within the fabric of the existing (and larger) transportation ecosystem, it is critical to understand how individuals may respond and “who” the likely users of these relatively new modes may be. In this paper, we develop a model to analyze first-use and use frequency of two micromobility modes: E-scooter sharing systems (ESS) and Bike sharing systems (BSS). The model employs psycho-social constructs, built environment attributes, as well as individual-level demographics as determinants. In doing so, we explicitly recognize the role played by awareness/first-use of new technologies as a cognitive antecedent to subsequent frequency decisions. The main data source for this analysis is drawn from a 2019 survey of Austin, Texas area residents. Our results highlight the importance of considering psycho-social attitudes to both gain better insights into the behavioral process leading up to ESS/BSS adoption/use as well as ensure an accurate data fit. In particular, there are distinctive pathways of adoption/use frequency for each of the ESS and BSS modes, but also complementary processes and behavioral spillover effects at play that warrant a joint modeling of the ESS and BSS modes. Our results suggest that addressing safety concerns of micromobility modes should be the top priority of providers and public agencies. Efforts solely directed toward extoling the “green” virtues of micromobility modes is likely to have limited returns.}

This paper proposes a mathematical model and a heuristic method for a network design problem that combines two objectives regarding infrastructural investments (i.e., the number of charging stations to be deployed) and service aspects (i.e., minimizing the travelled distances). The proposed model and the developed heuristic delineate a strategic-level approach to the delivery process using drones.}

abstract = {Various solutions have been proposed to alleviate the shortage of parking places, including parking reservation systems and shared-parking systems. In such systems, drivers submit their parking requests in advance, especially their arrival and departure time. Then, the systems will reserve a proper parking spot for a driver if his/her parking request is accepted. However, the driver may arrive earlier or depart later, which may cause service failure. In shared-parking systems, the distributions of commuters’ arrival/departure time have fixed patterns and may be learned based on historical data. Given the distributions of drivers’ arrival/departure time, this paper proposes a Chance-constraint optimization model to solve the reservation and allocation problem for the shared-parking platform. This model aims to maximize the parking utilization level (i.e., the expectation of total occupied parking hours) and keep the service failure rate below a threshold value. We propose a rule-based mixed-integer linear programming to seek a satisfying solution to this model. Numerical tests show that our model performs better than baseline models in indicators such as parking utilization level and service failure rate.}

abstract = {Traffic signal failures could result in significant local and system-level performance degradation. Sequencing the restoration of failed signals with limited resources is a challenging problem—capturing dynamic changing transportation system performance following a feasible solution requires tedious computation, and the short time frame for restoring failed signals makes these decisions time-sensitive and should be determined in a timely manner. Feasible Signal Restoration Sequence Ordering (SRSO) problem, as a critical building block to optimize the restoration sequence, has not been well-studied in the existing literature, nor have solutions to address the computational burden issue. In this work, a machine learning model based on Structural Recurrent Neural Network (SRNN) is proposed to predict system performance, i.e., aggregated accumulated total delay, following a given restoration sequence, to address the computational burden of the simulation-based performance evaluation. Spatio-temporal (ST) graph representation is leveraged in this methodology to take the topological information, i.e., how adjacent movements interact with each other, into consideration. Although microscopic simulation is used to obtain the ground truth performance, which is still time-consuming for a group of signal failure scenarios, a trained machine learning model can surrogate the tedious computation in the decision-making process in a timely manner. The challenges to build this machine learning model effectively and efficiently are two-folds. First, a transportation system is a typical dynamic system whose behavior is constrained by the topology of the network. Therefore, both spatial and temporal interactions between road sections should be captured to predict system performance effectively. Second, in the context of signal failure, system performance is exposed to a disrupted control strategy, which makes it even more challenging to predict system performance effectively. The original SRNN model could address the first challenge, and the movement feature representation and its integration to the SRNN model proposed in this work could address the second. A case study was conducted to demonstrate the operability and effectiveness of the proposed methodology. It is demonstrated that the signal restoration sequence could impact system performance during and after the restoration process significantly. Then, both Aggregated Accumulated Total Delay (AATD) prediction accuracy and the performance of restoration sequence ordering is evaluated for the case study network. Outcomes of the case study show that the learning-based model can help identify sequences ranked in top 8\% of optional sequences referring to ground truth information. Furthermore, in terms of the fine-tune of the learning rate, the Cosine-Annealing-LR strategy leads to both lower loss value, better ordering performance, and shorter delay experienced in the restoration process, compared to the Step-LR strategy.}

The primary purpose of this study is to develop a mobility mode inference model able to consider the sequential behaviors of choosing a mobility mode by using long-term recurrent convolutional networks (LRCNs). Only GPS profile data are used for the mobility mode classification. The modes are categorized into walk, bike, motorcycle, bus, driving, train, and Segway. The proposed LRCN architecture applies the sequencing mode transition concept, a novel concept in mobility mode inference research. We conducted a data preprocessing procedure to normalize the input data size, capture the motion behaviors from the GPS points, and refine the data. We then identified an optimal convolutional neural network (CNN) model by considering the number of layers, layer-order pattern, and number of filters. The CNN model was established by applying an ensemble CNN concept to a single optimal CNN model. Furthermore, we integrated the optimal CNN model and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network as an LRCN, so as to consider the sequential behaviors in choosing the mobility mode over time. Consequently, we established an optimal LRCN–bi model with the highest performance among the existing LRCN architectures. By comparing the confusion matrices of each of the two best models in the CNN and LRCN approaches, we confirmed that considering the sequential behaviors in choosing the mobility mode enhances the model’s performance in inferring the mobility mode. Furtherm ore, we confirmed that the LRCN approach outperforms approaches from previous studies.}

The process of congestion propagation from a particular road to its neighbors can be regarded as a kind of message passing with a directed relationship. Existing methods have created a solid foundation for characterizing congestion propagation; however, they are either built upon simplified assumptions in traffic flow theory or predefined relationships among road sections, which would lead to downgraded accuracy in practice. This paper proposes a dynamic Bayesian graph convolutional network (DBGCN), which integrates Bayesian inference into a deep learning framework. Therefore, the rules of congestion propagation in the network can be actively learned from the observed data instead of predefining them based on prior knowledge. Experimental results on 971 testbeds in a regional road network in Beijing demonstrate that DBGCN outperforms the state-of-the-art models in inferring the congestion propagation spatiotemporal coverage and reveals variations in congestion propagation patterns according to the road network structure. Furthermore, the proposed model can simulate the congestion propagation process in customized scenarios by learning the latent congestion propagation rules. The results in different scenarios show that the change of congestion source location leads to distinct congestion magnitude, and the propagation of congestion will eventually stop at the road sections with strong shunting effect.}

abstract = {Over the last years, there have been initiated several pilots with autonomous minibusses. Unlike regular bus services, autonomous minibusses serve a limited number of stops and have more flexible schedules since they do not require bus drivers. This allows the operation of a line through a flexible combination of sublines, where a subline serves a subset of consecutive stops in the same order as the original line. This paper studies the subline frequency setting (SFS) problem under uncertain passenger demand. We present a frequency setting model that assigns autonomous minibusses to sublines in order to exploit the available resources as much as possible and minimize the operational and passenger waiting time costs. Passenger waiting time costs may depend on the combination of several lines whose frequencies cannot be perfectly aligned for each passenger journey. We present a new estimation of the expected waiting time for passengers to improve the accuracy of the passenger waiting time costs in the case of sublines. Our SFS model is originally formulated as a MINLP and reformulated as a MILP that can be solved to global optimality. Further, we explicitly consider the uncertainty of passenger demand in the optimization process by formulating a stochastic optimization model. The performances of our stochastic and deterministic models that assign minibusses to sublines are tested under various passenger demand scenarios in the 14-stop autonomous minibus line in Eberbach, Germany and a fictional bus line with 20 bus stops. Results show potential improvements in operational costs in the range of 10\%–40\% depending on the passenger demand profile.}

In this collaboration, agents of one type (the shippers) cannot increase their payoffs without the participation of an agent of the other type (the carrier). One key issue for such collaboration is the cost allocation among the shippers. Motivated by this real need, we introduce a new class of games called double-type player games and propose a cost/payoff allocation method for them. Each double-type player game has two types of players or agents: service requestors and service providers. We prove that the core of any game in this class is not empty and apply the concept of cross-evaluation originating from data envelopment analysis to generate a fair cost/payoff allocation among the players in such a game. More particularly, we propose a new and simple method called proportional cross-evaluation method for generating an allocation in the semi-core with some important properties. It is based on self-evaluation and peer-evaluations of the contribution of each player to the grand coalition. As applications, this method is applied to the cost allocation of double-type player games appearing in shipper collaboration in both truckload transportation and less-than-truckload transportation. It is compared with several popularly used allocation methods by numerical experiments. The results show that our method outperforms those methods in generating an allocation in the core.}

To obtain the data of drivers’ visual environment in the real world, a framework was proposed to obtain the Google street view (GSV) images. Deep neural network and computer vision technologies were applied to obtain the clustering and depth information from the GSV images. To reflect drivers’ visual environment in the real world, the coordinate transformation was conducted, and several visual measures were proposed and calculated. Three different tree-based ensemble models (i.e., random forest, adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)) were applied to estimate the number of speeding crashes and the comparison results showed that XGBoost could provide the best data fit. The explainable machine learning method were applied to explore the effects of drivers’ visual environment and other features on speeding crashes. The results validated the visual environment data obtained by the proposed method for the speeding crash analysis. It was suggested that the proportion of trees in the drivers’ view and the proportion of road length with trees could reduce speeding crashes. In addition, the complexity level of drivers’ visual environment was found to increase the crash occurrence. This study provided new insights to obtain the detailed information from GSV images for traffic safety analysis. The findings based on the explainable machine learning could also provide road planners and engineers clear suggestions to select appropriate countermeasures to enhance traffic safety.}

abstract = {As electric vehicles (EVs) become more prevalent, there is growing concern regarding their impact on transportation and power networks. Using vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, EVs can operate as additional energy storage sources that make the power grid more efficient and reliable. With their onboard battery, EVs can relocate energy supply spatially and temporally. In this study, we envision that the future deployment of bidirectional charging lanes is capable of transferring power wirelessly and bidirectionally in regional road networks. Additionally, in this study, these futuristic bidirectional charging lanes are controlled by a government agency that manages both transportation and power systems. The government agency attempts to minimize total system costs by using an electricity pricing scheme to buy energy from and sell energy to EVs, which can be modeled as a bi-level optimization problem. In this study, we developed a new user equilibrium (UE) model to depict the equilibrium conditions in a road network in which bidirectional charging lanes are deployed. When traveling between their origin and destination, EV drivers are assumed to select routes and decide on battery charging/discharging plans to minimize their trip costs while ensuring the completion of their trips without running out of range. Trip costs consist of trip travel time and the purchase price of electricity minus the benefits of discharging energy to the power grid. Having established UE conditions, we next formulated the equilibrium conditions of a transportation network coupled with an electricity network as a non-linear complementarity system, which formed our lower-level problem. In such a network, the agency tries to provide energy to both networks with the objective of minimizing total system costs. To formulate the agency’s decision-making process, an additional layer of optimization is added on top of the coupled networks, which is our upper-level problem. This layer minimizes the total travel time and the price of electricity paid to EVs and generators. Next, to efficiently solve the model, a meta-heuristic solution algorithm based on gray wolf optimizer and manifold sub-optimization was developed. The model and the solution algorithm were evaluated based on three different numerical examples. Numerical results demonstrate that bidirectional charging lanes have significant potential to reduce peak load and charging costs associated with EVs.}

abstract = {Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HVs) are expected to coexist in the near future. CAV-dedicated lanes and phases have been explored to handle the uncertainty in the driving behavior of HVs in the mixed traffic environment. However, CAV-dedicated phases could significantly sacrifice HV benefits. This study proposes a shared-phase-dedicated-lane (SPDL)-based traffic control model at an isolated intersection with CAV dedicated lanes in the mixed traffic environment. In the proposed model, left-turn and through CAVs share CAV-dedicated lanes and cross the intersection during the shared phases with HVs. A three-level optimization model is developed. At the upper level, a standard NEMA (National Electrical Manufacturers Association) ring barrier structure is used for the signal optimization and barrier durations are optimized by dynamic programming to minimize the total vehicle delay. At the middle level, phase sequences and phase durations are optimized by enumeration for the given barrier from the upper level and the minimum vehicle delay is fed to the upper level. At the lower level, CAV platooning in the buffer zone and trajectory planning in the passing zone are conducted based on the signal timings of the barrier from the middle level and the travel time of CAVs is fed to the middle level. A rolling-horizon scheme is designed for the dynamical implementation of the proposed model with time-varying traffic conditions. The proposed model is applicable to intersections with more than two lanes in each approach and without shared lanes by left-turn and through HVs, which are commonly seen critical intersections in urban traffic control. Numerical studies validate the advantages of the SPDL-based control over the blue-phase-based control in previous studies in terms of average vehicle delay and intersection capacity. Further, the SPDL-based model is extended to serve as an alternative approach without the buffer zone.}

Dense light detection and ranging (Lidar) point clouds and time-stamped trajectory data are used to model static intersection environment and emulate traffic participants’ dynamic motion states, respectively. The proposed procedure reads trajectory data in sequence according to their timestamps. An agent-based approach that enables the application of multi-core parallel computing is applied to estimate conflict points and identify conflicting agents in pairs. Then, a linear elevation array is created from the Lidar point cloud data, based on which the elevation of each trajectory point is obtained in a real-time manner. Meanwhile, three-dimensional bounding cuboids are generated at each path point to represent digital twins of agents. Once a pair of conflicting agents are identified, a hybrid approach is triggered to examine whether the agents’ line-of-sights are occluded by either static (e.g., tree trunk) or dynamic obstacles (e.g., cars). Accordingly, virtual warning signals can be generated. The effectiveness of the procedure is demonstrated through controlled experiments. The procedure was also tested in two virtual scenarios. The mean processing time at each frame is less than 0.1 s as achieved with limited computational power. With implementation of parallel computing technique, processing time is not sensitive to number of agents within the intersection. In addition, by enabling the outputs of virtual warning signals, spatial distribution of conflict points, and individual conflict-related time series data, the procedure shall help provide substantial insights into intersection safety.}

abstract = {The Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) system is a Cooperative Intelligent Transportation System (C-ITS) that is supposed to reduce the energy consumption and travel time associated with a vehicle trip by providing an optimal speed profile to avoid unnecessary stops at an intersection, based on Traffic Light Signals (TLSs) information. It is expected that GLOSA solutions will be widely deployed on transportation networks, thanks to the rapid spread of increasingly effective and pervasive communication technologies. Thus, appropriate methodologies and tools should be adopted to test sustainability objectives and evaluate the effects of such systems on the performance of traffic networks. In this perspective, this paper proposes an enhanced testing approach of GLOSA services based on an Integrated Simulation Environment that combines custom models developed in Matlab/Simulink with the SUMO traffic simulation environment, allowing both the traffic environment and vehicle dynamics to be represented with a suitable level of detail. The proposed approach can be used to cover several aspects which, in the existing technical literature, are: (i) not considered (traffic signal phase condition); (ii) rarely considered (electric engine); (iii) considered in a non-integrated way (traffic condition, TLS cycle duration, communication distance and minimum speed). Indeed, the considered factors pertain to different subsystems of the mobility environment (network and vehicles), and the proposed testing framework allows an equally detailed simulation of all, thus enhancing the accuracy of the results. To show the validity of the proposed approach, this study considers one controlled vehicle, equipped with a GLOSA system, travelling along a single route through a city centre including many TLSs. The simulation analysis deals with different levels of considered factors, assessed through Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) related to mobility and environmental indicators. Numerical results confirm that the proposed Integrated Simulation Environment can give valuable insights and suggestions to design a GLOSA system aiming to enhance both mobility and environmental performance. They also show that the factors in question affect system performance differently.}

In this framework, the objective function to be minimized contains appropriate respective terms to reflect: the goals of vehicle advancement; passenger comfort; and avoidance of collisions with other vehicles and of road departures. Connectivity implies, within the present work, that connected vehicles can exchange with each other (V2V) real-time information about their last generated short-term path. For the numerical solution of the optimal control problem, an efficient feasible direction algorithm (FDA) is used. To ensure high-quality local minima, a simplified Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithm is also conceived to deliver the initial guess trajectory for the start of the FDA iterations. Thanks to very low computation times, the approach is readily executable within a model predictive control (MPC) framework. The proposed MPC-based approach is embedded within the Aimsun microsimulation platform, which enables the evaluation of a plethora of realistic vehicle driving and advancement scenarios under different vehicles mixes. Results obtained on a multilane motorway stretch indicate higher efficiency of the optimally controlled vehicles in driving closer to their desired speed, compared to ordinary manually driven vehicles. Increased penetration rates of automated vehicles are found to increase the efficiency of the overall traffic flow, benefiting manual vehicles as well. Moreover, connected controlled vehicles appear to be more efficient in achieving their desired speed, compared also to the corresponding non-connected controlled vehicles, due to the improved real-time information and short-term prediction achieved via V2V communication.}

abstract = {New types of vehicles, such as electricity-powered and/or autonomous cars or buses, are under rapid development, but the time needed to turn the existing stock of traditional vehicles, such as privately-owned human-driven fossil fuelled passenger cars, will likely last several years during which mixed traffic is expected. Moreover, the likely effects of the introduction of such vehicles may not be necessarily positive. Thus, a careful analysis of their various impacts through well designed tools is needed. Main tools for transportation systems analysis are based on methods for travel demand assignment to a transportation network, commonly used to support transportation project assessment and evaluation. The original contribution of this paper is twofold. First, a modelling approach to multi vehicle type assignment is proposed, in this approach the user choice proportions among vehicle types available to users are the results of an explicit choice behaviour model instead of input data as in all existing papers on multi-vehicle assignment. This approach is applied for analysing assignment to transportation networks including Fixed-Point models for equilibrium assignment and Deterministic and Stochastic Process models for day-to-to dynamic assignment. Second, statistical methods are introduced to study the bifurcation of SP models, in order to account for the stochasticity of such models. In particular, the Hartigan’s Dip statistic, which measure the degree of unimodality of a distribution, showed to be the most effective one in identifying bifurcation in SP models. Fixed-point stability and bifurcation analysis are carried out too, and some simple numerical examples are also discussed. Reported results show that innovative vehicles with less impact on congestion than traditional ones may not have a positive effect on equilibrium stability since negative effect of reducing route choice dispersion may be compensate the positive effects on congestion.}

abstract = {We contribute to the understanding of public transport passenger route choice behavior by developing and applying methods that capture behavioral strategies by making use of smart card data. We begin by proposing the classification of possible route choice behavioral strategies in two groups: disaggregated strategies and aggregated strategies. In the former, the alternatives correspond to itineraries, which are fixed sequences of stops and public transport lines. In the latter, common line alternatives are considered, which are combinations of itineraries defined under given criteria. Almost all route choice models use consideration sets composed only of itineraries, while public transport assignment models for strategic analysis mostly use a version of the common lines approach. We postulate that this dichotomy is inappropriate and that, instead, heterogeneity exists in the route choice strategy, both between users and across contexts. With the aim of verifying this hypothesis, we first propose an indicator function constructed as the difference between expected and observed trips for a given behavioral assumption. We apply then the indicator to a case study based on smart card data from the city of Santiago, Chile, from which we find evidence of heterogeneity. We identify individuals that follow either an aggregated or a disaggregated strategy, as well as others who seem to be using a combination of both strategies. We further analyze the heterogeneity hypothesis using an integrated discrete choice and latent class approach, which we apply to the same case study. This approach involves estimating path-size logit models built with alternatives from disaggregated and aggregated strategies, as well as a latent class model built from a combination of both. It also addresses methodological challenges related to the definition of the consideration set and the correction of endogeneity. Results confirm the heterogeneity hypothesis, suggesting that the mean probability that passengers belong to the class that uses a disaggregated strategy for route choice is 51.2\%, and that this heterogeneity markedly occurs between individuals, not within their choices. We also find that the latent class considering aggregated alternatives appear to prefer bus over metro, while the latent class considering disaggregated alternatives prefer metro over bus. The fact that waiting time is relatively more burdensome for the aggregated strategy class is in line with this class’s preference for common lines. Walking time and bus crowding are more burdensome for the disaggregated strategy class, in line with their observed modal preferences.}

Existing methods to address these problems are time-consuming and not adaptive to changing driving conditions on rough pavements. With the development of sensor and communication technologies, crowdsourced road and dynamic traffic information become available for enhancing driving performance, particularly addressing the discomfort and inefficiency issues by controlling driving speeds. This study proposes a speed control framework on rough pavements, envisioning the operation of autonomous vehicles based on the crowdsourced data. We suggest the concept of ‘maximum comfortable speed’ for representing the vertical ride comfort of oncoming roads. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is designed to learn comfortable and energy-efficient speed control strategies. The DRL-based speed control model is trained using real-world rough pavement data in Shanghai, China. The experimental results show that the vertical ride comfort, energy efficiency, and computation efficiency increase by 8.22\%, 24.37\%, and 94.38\%, respectively, compared to an optimization-based speed control model. The results indicate that the proposed framework is effective for real-time speed controls of autonomous vehicles on rough pavements.}

For a more accurate prediction, recent studies started using not only the temporal speed patterns but also the spatial information on the road network through the graph convolutional networks. Even though the road network is highly complex due to its non-Euclidean and directional characteristics, previous approaches mainly focused on modeling the spatial dependencies using the distance only. In this paper, we identify two essential spatial dependencies in traffic forecasting in addition to distance, direction and positional relationship, for designing basic graph elements as the fundamental building blocks. Using the building blocks, we suggest DDP-GCN (Distance, Direction, and Positional relationship Graph Convolutional Network) to incorporate the three spatial relationships into deep neural networks. We evaluate the proposed model with two large-scale real-world datasets, and find positive improvements for long-term forecasting in highly complex urban networks. The improvement can be larger for commute hours, but it can be also limited for short-term forecasting.}

abstract = {Fully automated vehicles (AVs) are set to become a reality in future decades and changes are to be expected in user perceptions and behavior. While AV acceptability has been widely studied, changes in human drivers’ behavior and in passengers’ reactions have received less attention. It is not yet possible to ascertain the risk of driver behavioral changes such as overreaction, and the corresponding safety problems, in mixed traffic with partially AVs. Nor has there been proper investigation of the potential unease of car occupants trained for human control, when exposed to automatic maneuvers. The conjecture proposed in this paper is that automation Level 2 vehicles do not induce potentially adverse effects in traditional vehicle drivers’ behavior or in occupants’ reactions, provided that they are indistinguishable from human-driven vehicles. To this end, the paper proposes a Turing approach to test the “humanity” of automation Level 2 vehicles. The proposed test was applied to the results of an experimental campaign carried out in Italy: 546 car passengers were interviewed on board Level 2 cars in which they could not see the driver. They were asked whether a specific driving action (braking, accelerating, lane keeping) had been performed by the human driver or by the automatic on-board software under different traffic conditions (congestion and speed). Estimation results show that in most cases the interviewees were unable to distinguish the Artificial Intelligence (AI) from the human driver by observing random responses with a 95\% significance level (proportion of success statistically equal to 50\%). However, in the case of moderate braking and lane keeping at >100 km/h and in high traffic congestion, respondents recognized AI control from the human driver above pure chance, with 62–69\% correct response rates. These findings, if confirmed in other case studies, could significantly impact on AVs acceptability, also contributing to their design as well as to long-debated ethical questions. AI driving software could be designed and tested for “humanity”, as long as safety is guaranteed, and autonomous cars could be allowed to circulate as long as they cannot be distinguished from human-driven vehicles in recurrent driving conditions.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel robust suggestion-based control framework based on model predictive control (MPC) to optimize the fuel efficiency of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) in heterogeneous urban traffic (i.e., including both CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs)). In this suggestion-based control framework, the CAVs are considered to provide suggestion commands to the HDVs to follow. These suggestion commands are the velocities the CAVs want the HDVs to follow to improve their own, as well as the group’s fuel economy. The host CAV thus needs to find its own fuel-efficient control solution, as well as the suggestion commands to be provided to its preceding HDV. We assume the CAVs can communicate with the HDVs via Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) communication, and the Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) information are available to the CAVs through Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) communication. The suggested velocity commands are held constant for a predefined time to allow the driver in the HDV to reach the suggested velocity. We also consider that the suggested velocity commands are non binding, i.e., a driver can choose not to follow the suggested velocity. For this control framework to function, we present a velocity prediction model based on experimental data that captures the response of a HDV to different suggested-commands, and a robust approach to ensure collision avoidance. The velocity prediction’s accuracy is also validated with the experimental data (on a table-top drive simulator), and the results are presented in this paper. Simulation studies show the proposed control strategy’s efficacy compared with existing baseline methods.}

As a promising tool, pricing improves the level of service in a network and reduces travel delays. However, previous advancements in pricing research that are responsive to the prevailing regional traffic conditions did not consider real-time applications and the effect on users’ route choices. This work uses real-time dynamic pricing’s influence and predicts pricing functions to aim for a system optimal traffic distribution. The framework models a large-scale network where every region is considered homogeneous, allowing for the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) application. We compute Dynamic System Optimum (DSO) and Dynamic Route Choice (DRC) of the macroscopic model by formulating a linear optimization problem and utilizing the Dijkstra algorithm and a Multinomial Logit model (MNL), respectively. The equilibria allow us to find an optimal pricing methodology by training Multi-Layer-Neural (MLN) network models. We test our framework on a case study in Zurich, Switzerland, and showcase that (a) our neural network model learns the complex user behavior and (b) allows predicting optimal pricing functions. Results show a significant performance improvement when operating a transportation network in the DSO and highlight how dynamic pricing influences the user’s route choice behavior towards the system optimal equilibrium.}

This paper adds new experimental evidence to this knowledge base and presents a comprehensive empirical study on the ACC equilibrium behaviors via the resulting fundamental diagrams. We find that, like human-driven vehicles, ACC systems display a linear equilibrium spacing-speed relationship (within the range of available data) but the key parameters of these relationships can differ significantly from human-driven traffic depending on input settings. At the minimum ACC headway setting, equilibrium capacities in excess of 3500 vehicles per hour are observed, together with an extremely fast equilibrium wave speed of 100 kilometers per hour. These fast waves are unfamiliar to human drivers, and may pose a safety risk. The results also suggest that ACC jam spacing can be much larger than in human traffic, which reduces the network storage capacity.}

abstract = {A joint control approach that simultaneously optimizes traffic signals and trajectories of cooperative (automated) vehicle platooning at urban intersections is presented in this paper. In the proposed approach, the signal phase lengths and the accelerations of the controlled platoons are optimized to maximize comfort and minimize travel delay within the signal cycle, subject to motion constraints on speeds, accelerations and safe following gaps. The red phases are initially considered as logic constraints, and then recast as several linear constraints to enable efficient solutions. The proposed approach is solved by mixed integer linear programming (MILP) techniques after linearization of the objective function. The generated outputs of the MILP problem are the optimal signal timings and the optimal accelerations of all vehicles. This joint control approach is flexible in incorporating multiple platoons and traffic movements under different traffic demand levels and it does not require prespecified terminal conditions on position and speed at the signal cycle tail. The performance of the proposed control approach is verified by simulation at a standard four-arm intersection under the balanced and unbalanced vehicle arrival rates from different arms, taking the released traffic movement numbers, turning proportions, signal cycle lengths and the controlled vehicle numbers into account. The simulation results demonstrate the platoon performance of the joint controller (such as split, merge, acceleration and deceleration maneuvers) under the optimal signals. Based on the simulation results, the optimal patterns of trajectories and signals are explored, which provide insights into the optimal traffic control actions at intersections in a cooperative vehicle environment. Furthermore, the computational performance of the proposed control approach is analyzed, and the benefits of the proposed approach on the average travel delay, throughput, fuel consumption, and emission are proved by comparing with the two-layer approaches using the car following model, the signal optimization models, and the state-of-the-art approach.}

It investigates how the combined usage of both types of sensing data improves the performance of traffic state estimation (TSE) and what role the online model parameter estimation (OMPE) plays therein. The paper first presents a state-of-the-art overview for freeway TSE with mixed sensing, focusing on a few critical issues such as filtering methods, Eulerian and Lagrangian formulation for traffic flow modeling/sensing/estimation, OMPE, and fusion of disparate sensing data, to determine the strengths and weaknesses of various technical paths, and figure out a viable roadmap for future studies. Three representative approaches to the design of freeway traffic state estimators using mixed sensing data are then investigated, which are based on a first-order, a second-order traffic flow model, and a speed-uniformity assumption, respectively. The paper intends to check if the gradual richness of mobile sensing data (in the era of connected vehicles) would compensate the deficiency of first-order models (as compared to second-order models) for TSE; if OMPE would still be essential for TSE in the mixed sensing case compared to the fixed sensing case; if the increasing usage of mobile sensing data would reduce the necessity of OMPE for TSE? The designed traffic state estimators have been evaluated thoroughly using NGSIM data, with the above questions answered.}

abstract = {Dynamic traffic models require dynamic inputs, one of the main ones being the Dynamic Origin–Destinations (OD) matrices describing the variability over time of the trip patterns across the network. The Dynamic OD Matrix Estimation (DODME) is a challenging problem since no direct observations are available, and therefore one should resort to indirect estimation approaches. Among the most efficient approaches, the one that formulates the problem in terms of a bi-level optimization problem has been widely used. This formulation solves at the upper level a nonlinear optimization problem that minimizes some distance measures between observed and estimated link flow counts at certain counting stations located in a subset of links in the network, and at the lower level a traffic assignment that estimates these link flow counts assigning the current estimated matrix. The variants of this formulation differ in the analytical approaches that estimate the link flows in terms of the traffic assignment and their time dependencies. Since these estimations are based on a traffic assignment at the lower level, these analytical approaches, although numerically efficient, imply a high computational cost. The advent of ICT applications has made available new sets of traffic-related measurements enabling new approaches; under certain conditions, the data collected allows to estimate the most likely used paths, from which a de facto assignment matrix can be computed. This allows extracting empirically similar information to that provided by the dynamic traffic assignment that is used in the analytical approaches. This paper explores how to extract such information from the recorded commercial data, proposes a new constrained non-linear optimization model to solve the DODME problem, with a reduced number of variables linearly depending on network size instead of quadratically. Moreover, the bilevel iterative process and the traffic assignment need are avoided. Validation and computational results on its performance are presented.}

(i) A methodology is proposed that allows to effectively train DCNNs on variable-sized space–time domains given empirical data prone to a varying penetration rate. Therefore, space–time domains are decomposed into small unified grids, which are processed separately. Second, in order to cope with varying penetration rates of available probe data, the network input is designed as two input matrices: grid-based speed data and grid occupancies. (ii) Using empirical probe data collected during 43 congestion scenarios on a freeway of 143 km length a shallow encoding–decoding CNN and a deep CNN are trained to reconstruct heterogeneous congestion types, such as moving and stationary congestion. It is demonstrated that for training only data of a single sparse data source is needed but no complete Ground Truth (GT), and still heterogeneous congestion types are reconstructed accurately. (iii) The estimation accuracy of a shallow encoding–decoding CNN and a DCNN, based on the U-net, are compared with traditional methods such as the ASM and PSM. An unseen complex congestion scenario is studied with all approaches and the estimation results are analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively.

abstract = {With the unprecedented shift towards automated urban environments in recent years, a new paradigm is required to study pedestrian behaviour. Studying pedestrian behaviour in futuristic scenarios requires modern data sources that consider both the Automated Vehicle (AV) and pedestrian perspectives. Current open datasets on AVs predominantly fail to account for the latter, as they do not include an adequate number of events and associated details that involve pedestrian and vehicle interactions. To address this issue, we propose using Virtual Reality (VR) data as a complementary resource to current datasets, which can be designed to measure pedestrian behaviour under specific conditions. In this research, we focus on the context-aware pedestrian trajectory prediction framework for automated vehicles at mid-block unsignalized crossings. For this purpose, we develop a novel multi-input network of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and fully connected dense layers. In addition to past trajectories, the proposed framework incorporates pedestrian head orientations and distance to the upcoming vehicles as sequential input data. By merging the sequential data with contextual information of the environment, we train a model to predict the future pedestrian trajectory. Our results show that the prediction error is reduced by considering contextual information extracted from the crossing environment, as well as the addition of time-series behavioural information to the model. To analyse the application of the methods to real AV data, the proposed framework is trained and applied to pedestrian trajectories extracted from an open-access video dataset. Finally, by implementing a game theory-based model interpretability method, we provide detailed insights and propose recommendations to improve the current automated vehicle sensing systems from a pedestrian-oriented point of view.}

With respect to public transportation, autonomous buses---as a means of small and flexible on-demand services---have the potential of increasing the accessibility of people and lower operational costs. As such services are not currently available, their acceptance by their prospective riders and their potential to boost public transportation are yet to be identified. The present study aims at shedding light on these issues by combining a Wizard-of-Oz experiment with a two-stage stated preference (SP) study. The participants of the study had the opportunity to try an ostensible autonomous bus, in the form of a feeder service, over a period of two to four weeks (Wizard-of-Oz experiment). Furthermore, they were confronted with the same hypothetical mode choice tasks, including two autonomous bus alternatives (SP experiment), before and after the Wizard-of-Oz experiment. The study took place in two cities in Germany, namely Berlin and Braunschweig. In this paper, we analyze the mode choices of the pooled sample of participants using a Mixed Logit model with random parameters in order to tackle respondents' heterogeneity of preferences. By estimating the model using the answers from the before and after experiments, we show that there is a positive effect in favor of the autonomous bus service for the feeder trip.

abstract = {This article presents some of the results on the implementation of a decentralised delay management process that we call 4D trajectory adjustments (4DTA) obtained with Mercury, a stochastic agent-based model. The model operates within a strong agent paradigm at the level of individual flights and passengers. It includes a realistic cost model for the airlines, allowing us to have a good tactical choice model and excellent estimation of airspace user costs. Due to the inclusion of different stakeholders, including passengers, and various processes – like aircraft turnaround or passenger reaccommodation – it is able to catch European-wide network effects that are inaccessible to other models. It was used to study the 4DTA process, a blend of ‘wait for passengers and tactical speed adjustments’, which is shown to have a significant impact on the system. Thanks to the detailed output of the model, we are able to breakdown the effect for different classes of flights and passengers, and show that important trade-offs exist in terms of delays and costs. In particular, the introduction of such mechanism could be detrimental to non-connecting passengers, especially at secondary airports.}

A ‘Driver’s Risk Field’ (DRF) function has been previously shown to be able to predict manual driving behaviour in several simulated scenarios. In this paper, we tested if the DRF-based risk estimate (rˆ) could predict manual driving behaviour and the driver’s perceived risk during automated driving. To ensure that the participants perceived realistic levels of risk, the experiment was conducted in a test vehicle. Eight participants drove five laps manually and experienced 12 different laps of automated driving on a test track. The test track consisted of three sections (which were sub-divided into 12 sectors): curve driving (9 sectors), parked car (1 sector), and 90-degree intersections (2 sectors). If the driver verbally expressed risk or performed a takeover, that particular sector was labelled as risky. The results show that the DRF risk estimate (rˆ) predicted manual driving behaviour (ρsteering=0.69, ρspeed=0.64), as well as correlated with the driver’s perceived risk in curve driving (r2 = 0.98) and while negotiating a car parked outside the lane boundary (r2=0.59). In conclusion, the DRF-based risk estimate (rˆ) is predictive of manual driving behaviour and perceived risk in automated driving. Future research should include tactical and strategic components to the driving task.}

abstract = {Real-time information about the dynamic variation of turning rates at intersections is essential for achieving a more efficient traffic control and management system. Limitations in obtaining measurements of turning movements have drawn attention to the need for alternative methods for estimation of turning rates. In a large-scale urban network, characteristics such as disparate signal plans and various intersection layouts make defining a generic model for the entire network challenging. For this reason, most of the proposed methods are impractical for real-field implementation. The application of existing optimization-based methods is also limited by computational complexity, the need for pre-defined assumptions and insufficient stationary traffic measurements (e.g. loop detectors and plate recognition cameras) in urban networks. In this study, we take advantage of probe vehicles to propose a hybrid method that noticeably reduces the need for stationary measurements in the network. This hybrid method consists of two core stages: signal processing, and physical data-driven modeling to consecutively estimate turning rates. In the signal processing phase, we use wavelet transformation to extract fundamental components of inferred floating car turning rates. These components are then used as inputs to a turning rate estimation model. Using these decomposed components of floating car turning rates instead of raw input helps to balance the effect of low and high-frequency signal components and leads to a more accurate estimation. Investigation of the proposed method in a microscopic simulation environment reveals the ability of the hybrid model to detect turning rate variations even when a severe incident occurs.}

The framework aimed to achieve a safe MLC maneuver with multiple-CAV cooperation, including the lane change times, positions, and trajectories for the CAVs, while minimizing the impacts of the MLC maneuver on overall traffic. This problem was rigorously formulated and solved by an analytical method that significantly decreases computational time and renders the methodology suitable for practical implementations. To evaluate the performance of the proposed DC-MLC framework, we built a CAV testing environment by referring to the next generation simulation program (NGSIM) US 101 dataset. A series of numerical experiments were conducted under the built CAV testing environment. The results showed that the proposed DC-MLC framework could achieve safe, traffic-efficient, and comfortable MLC maneuvers. Moreover, the trajectories generated by the proposed DC-MLC framework outperformed those of human drivers in terms of speed standard deviation, maximum acceleration/deceleration, and maximum acceleration jerk.}

abstract = {This study proposes a rotation-based connected automated vehicle (CAV) distributed cooperative control strategy for an on-ramp merging scenario. By assuming the mainline and ramp line are straight, we firstly design a virtual rotation approach that transfers the merging problem to a virtual car following (CF) problem to reduce the complexity and dimension of the cooperative CAVs merging control. Based on this concept, a multiple-predecessor virtual CF model and a unidirectional multi-leader communication topology are developed to determine the longitudinal behavior of each CAV. Specifically, we exploit a distributed feedback and feedforward longitudinal controller in preparation for actively generating gaps for merging CAVs, reducing the voids caused by merging, and ensuring safety and traffic efficiency during the process. To ensure the disturbance attenuation property of this system, practical string stability is mathematically proved for the virtual CF controllers to prohibit the traffic oscillation amplification through the traffic stream. Moreover, as a provision for extending the virtual CF application scenarios of any curvy ramp geometry, we utilize a curvilinear coordinate to model the two-dimensional merging control, and further design a local lateral controller based on an extended linear-quadratic regulator to regulate the position deviation and angular deviation of the lane centerlines. For the purpose of systematically evaluating the control performance of the proposed methods, numerical simulation experiments are conducted. As the results indicate, the proposed controllers can actively reduce the void and meanwhile guarantee the damping of traffic oscillations in the merging control area.}

Future LAAT systems exemplify a new class of modern large scale engineering systems — networked control systems. They are spatially distributed, consist of many interconnected elements with control loops through digital communication networks such that the system signals can be exchanged among all components through a common network. Therefore, a decentralized controller design in framework of the unilateral event-driven paradigm is considered.

Additional resource allocation at the network level, such as AV-exclusive lanes, can further foster the usage of AVs rendering this mode of travel more attractive than legacy vehicles (LV). However, it is necessary to find the crucial locations in the network where providing these dedicated lanes would reap the maximum benefits. In this study, we propose an integrated mixed-integer programming framework for optimal AV-exclusive lane design on freeway networks which accounts for commuters’ demand split among AVs and LVs via a logit model incorporating class-based utilities. We incorporate the link transmission model (LTM) as the underlying traffic flow model due to its computational efficiency for system optimum dynamic traffic assignment. The LTM is modified to integrate two vehicle classes namely, LVs and AVs with a lane-based approach. The presence of binary variables to represent lane design and the logit model for endogenous demand estimation results in a nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear program formulation. We propose a Benders’ decomposition approach to tackle this challenging optimization problem. Our approach iteratively explores possible lane designs in the Benders’ master problem and, at each iteration, solves a sequence of system-optimum dynamic traffic assignment problems in an attempt to find fixed-points representative of logit-compatible demand splits. The proposed approach is implemented on three hypothetical freeway networks with single and multiple origins and destinations. Our numerical results reveal that the optimal lane design of freeway network is non-trivial while accounting for endogenous demand of each mode.}

Since the sequences of mixed traffic are combinatory, to reduce the training dimension and alleviate communication burdens, we decomposed mixed traffic into multiple subsystems where each subsystem is comprised of human-driven vehicles (HDV) followed by cooperative CAVs. Based on that, a cooperative CAV control strategy is developed based on a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, enabling CAVs to learn the leading HDV’s characteristics and make longitudinal control decisions cooperatively to improve the performance of each subsystem locally and consequently enhance performance for the whole mixed traffic flow. For training, a distributed proximal policy optimization is applied to ensure the training convergence of the proposed DRL. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, simulated experiments are conducted, which shows the performance of our proposed model has a great generalization capability of dampening oscillations, fulfilling the car following and energy-saving tasks efficiently under different penetration rates and various leading HDVs behaviors.}

abstract = {The capability of ridesplitting service to address current urban transportation problems has attracted considerable research interest in recent years. Given that ridesplitting needs an adequate user base to realize “sharing”, its success highly depends on a comprehensive understanding of people’s willingness of using it. However, previous studies mainly focused on the ridesplitting willingness based on questionnaire surveys at the individual level, which may help transportation network companies find potential users, but lacked studies on people’s ridesplitting willingness from the perspective of the built environment and time-space integration, because the macro urban elements are difficult to be perceived by individuals and thus hard to reflect in questionnaires. Thus, this study estimates the ridesplitting willingness rate of different areas in a city at different times of the day by building a model on the shared order rate and shareability from the real-world DiDi Chuxing dataset, using Chengdu, China, as a case study. The spatial lag model (SLM) is further utilized to exam the relationship between the willingness rate, built environment and transportation-related variables. Results revealed the ridesplitting willingness rate has a significant spatiotemporal pattern between the urban centre and urban periphery and can be divided into morning peak, noon plateau, afternoon valley, night peak, and midnight valley. SLM models indicate that the ridesplitting willingness rate has a significant spatial dependency on its vicinity areas at the origin of the daytime periods or at the destination at night. The distance to urban centre, the distance to railway station, travel demand, accessibility to public transit, land use mixture, and the trip purpose are found to be the most relevant variables with the willingness rate, while the points of interest (POIs) are almost irrelevant. The findings of this study can be helpful to the future promotion of this sustainable service and formulation of policy to improve service quality.}

In this paper, we have applied a double hurdle model to account for the low market penetration of electric cars in Australia and dealt with the high non-purchase choice. Data are obtained from nearly 1,900 individuals from eight major cities in Australia to explore consumer preferences regarding electric vehicles with photovoltaic solar cells option. The proposed model specification accounts for the panel impact generated from multiple tasks for each respondent, and the correlation between the two decisions on electric vehicle purchase and selecting the photovoltaic add-on. Furthermore, the systematic taste heterogeneity towards price variables is considered by introducing interactive sociodemographic terms to the utility functions. This study provides insights into the willingness-to-pay values for different features of electric vehicles and the solar panel add-on. The results show on average consumers are willing to pay a premium of \$18.13 on purchase price for every daily additional kilometre in driving range generated by solar panels. The average willingness to pay for the solar panel to match the colour of vehicle is \$1,021.09 for women, and \$1,803.92 for men.

Hence, transportation agencies have been increasingly interested in collecting truck body configuration data due to its strong association with industries and freight commodities, to better understand their distinct operational characteristics and impacts on infrastructure and the environment. The rapid advancement of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology has facilitated the development of non-intrusive detection solutions that are able to accurately classify truck body types in detail. This paper proposes a new truck classification method using a LiDAR sensor oriented to provide a wide field-of-view of roadways. In order to enrich the sparse point cloud obtained from the sensor, point clouds originating from the same truck across consecutive frames were grouped and combined using a two-stage vehicle reconstruction framework to generate a dense three-dimensional (3D) point cloud representation of each truck. Subsequently, PointNet – a deep representation learning algorithm – was adopted to train the classification model from reconstructed point clouds. The model utilizes low-level features extracted from the 3D point clouds and detects key features associated with each truck class. Finally, model ensemble techniques were explored to reduce the generalization error by averaging the results of seven PointNet models and further enhancing the overall model performance. The optimal number of models in the ensemble was determined through a comprehensive sensitivity analysis with the consideration of the average correct classification rate (CCR), the variability of the prediction results, and the computation efficiency. The developed model is capable of distinguishing passenger vehicles and 29 different truck body configurations with an average CCR of 83 percent. The average correct classification rate of the developed method on the test dataset was 90 percent for trucks pulling a large trailer(s).}

However, due to the lack of dynamic data and the difficulty in capturing risk perception, existing studies typically resort to static and stated approaches to infer the experienced level of risk of individuals. In this paper, we aimed to address this research gap through developing a hybrid choice model that jointly employed dynamic data on cycling behaviour in virtual reality and neural data to evaluate how the fluctuations in momentary risk perception influence the behaviour of cyclists. The results of the developed model confirm our hypotheses, demonstrating that cyclists reduce their speed when approaching a junction as the potential for a collision with passing cars increases. Moreover, the latent component allowed us to establish a link between the neural data, the amplitude of alpha brainwaves, and objective risk measures. In line with our hypothesis, we found that decreased alpha amplitude is associated with higher perceived risk, which in turn increases the likelihood of braking. The implications of our study are manifold. On the one hand, it shows the ability of virtual reality to elicit complex cyclists’ behaviour and the feasibility of a joint collection of dynamic neural and choice data. On the other hand, we demonstrated the potential of the employment of neural data in a hybrid model framework as an indicator of risk that allowed us to gain a better understanding of cycling behaviour and associated neural processing. These promising findings pave the way for future studies that aim to explore the advantages of neuroscientific inputs in the choice models.}

This paper focuses on providing a 3-dimensional (3D) simulation framework using a game-theoretical methodology to evaluate integration concepts using scenarios where manned and unmanned air vehicles co-exist. In the proposed method, the human pilot interactive decision-making process is incorporated into airspace models which can fill the gap in the literature where the pilot behavior is generally assumed to be known a priori. The proposed human pilot behavior is modeled using a dynamic level-k reasoning concept and approximate reinforcement learning. The level-k reasoning concept is a notion in game theory and is based on the assumption that humans have various levels of decision making. In the conventional “static” approach, each agent makes assumptions about his or her opponents and chooses his or her actions accordingly. On the other hand, in the dynamic level-k reasoning, agents can update their beliefs about their opponents and revise their level-k rule. In this study, Neural Fitted Q Iteration, which is an approximate reinforcement learning method, is used to model time-extended decisions of pilots with 3D maneuvers. An analysis of UAS integration is conducted using an Example 3D scenario in the presence of manned aircraft and fully autonomous UAS equipped with sense and avoid algorithms.}

We find that the percentage of population unfamiliar with AVs has declined over the years, which is probably due to a greater exposure to the information about AVs. All other variables being equal, individuals’ interest in AVs has not changed over time while their concerns have increased across time. The findings suggest that information campaigns or educational programs that introduce the advantages of AV adoption with a focus on the safety aspects of AVs could potentially alter public attitudes, which could help achieve greater market penetration.}

abstract = {Designing appropriate quality incentives in contracting out public bus services is essential to ensure that cost savings are not pursued at the expense of deteriorating quality. This study investigates a practical incentive design problem that links additional rewards and penalties to quality indicators of bus services. A leader–follower game model is proposed in which the transit authority (leader) determines the quality baseline of each bus service as well as the marginal reward for outperformance and penalty for underperformance. Subject to a given amount of budget, the transit authority has to guarantee a minimum profit margin for each transit operator so that they have enough incentives to improve the service quality. As a response, the profit-maximizing transit operators (followers) determine the level of service quality by weighing the marginal revenue and cost involved. A tailored solution approach is devised by exploiting the model properties. Motivated by Singapore’s recent trial, a case study is presented to demonstrate how the transit authority can determine the performance baseline as well as the reward-penalty levels for a large bus network and evaluate the amount of public funds needed to achieve a targeted quality outcome. Our analysis also cautions that quality deterioration may surprisingly occur in a few bus services after introducing the incentive scheme. This may be attributed to an unreasonably strict quality baseline and/or an inefficient operator running that service. It is thus suggested that the authority should figure out the real contributing factors and fine-tune the incentive scheme accordingly.}

Because flexible transit services vary in scope, size, and service type, new data-informed methods are useful to optimize services based on the specific needs of local communities and riders. In this study, real-world demand and vehicle trajectory data were used to evaluate and optimize system performance for an existing first-mile–last-mile (FMLM) service in Robinson Township, PA. A general FMLM model for arbitrary demand and service supply was then developed to quantify system performance—both travel time costs and day-to-day reliability—for various operational polices considering spatio-temporal demand variation and transportation network dynamics. Heuristics were used for optimal real-time vehicle routing in sizable real-world networks accommodating various service types and scopes. In this case study, total user costs were reduced by 18.6\% when rides were coordinated with mainline fixed-route transit. Predictive routing strategies were shown to marginally improve system performance under sparse and variable spatio-temporal demand. The case study also highlights potentially large travel time and user reliability improvements—reductions of 51\% and 53.8\%, respectively—when trip requests were made in advance of their desired pickup time. Finally, we show that travel time reliability can be improved for time-inflexible trips with trip prioritization without increasing total user costs. These results were stable to changes in demand density.}

Although microscopic models that only guarantee volume exclusion can qualitatively reproduce this phenomenon, they are not sufficient for a quantitative description. To quantitatively describe this phenomenon, a minimal anticipatory collision-free velocity model is introduced. Compared to the original velocity model, the new model reduces the occurrence of gridlocks and reproduces the movement of pedestrians more realistically. For a quantitative description of the phenomenon, an order parameter is used to describe the formation of lanes at transient states and to show that the proposed model compares relatively well with experimental data. Furthermore, the model is validated by the experimental fundamental diagrams of bidirectional flows.}

Based on the observation of the close relationship between the BS and the urban rail transit, our study focuses on the trip forecasting of the BSs around the subway stations. Firstly, the subway station related sites are investigated based on the BS dataset in Beijing, China. Secondly, multiple categories of features are extracted, including the subway station related site categories by clustering, the BS site mobility patterns by tensor decomposition, as well as other features (e.g., temporal, POI, meteorological, and air quality information). Finally, a three-layer ensemble learning model based method (i.e., the SAP-SF method) under the stacking strategy is proposed with integrations of multiple features and the several selected machine learning algorithms. It is applied to the simultaneous prediction of the hourly return numbers for a large-scale BS system involving a total of 280 sites in Beijing. The output performance is also examined by comparing the results with those obtained from the benchmark models. It is indicated that the features of subway station related site categories and site mobility patterns jointly contribute to the improvement of BS trip prediction. The accuracy can be increased layer by layer and is superior to the single machine learning algorithm. The research finding can provide useful information for system administrators to perform service level checks and to rebalance BSs around subway stations.}

However at low CAV penetration, the capacity gain will be small because the CAVs that randomly enter the road will be sparsely distributed, diminishing the probability of forming long platoons. Many researchers propose to solve this issue by platoon organization strategies, where the CAVs search for other CAVs on the road and change lanes if necessary to form longer platoons. However, the current literature does not analyze a potential risk of platoon organization in disrupting the flow and reducing the capacity by inducing more lane changes. In this research, we use driving model of Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) vehicles and human-driven vehicles that are validated with field experiments and find that platoon organization can indeed drop the capacity with more lane changes. But when the traffic demand is well below capacity, platoon organization forms longer CAV platoons without reducing the flow. Based on this finding, we develop the Flow-Aware platoon organization strategy, where the CAVs perform platoon organization conditionally on the local traffic state, i.e., a low flow and a high speed. We simulate the Flow-Aware platoon organization on a realistic freeway network and show that the CAVs successfully form longer platoons, while ensuring a maximal traffic flow.}

abstract = {Lane change intention prediction is an essential component for motion planning of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). In this work, we aim to achieve this task by using Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. One critical challenge on this task is that the dataset used for training such a network is usually highly imbalanced due to the fact that the size of left/right lane change data is much smaller than that of the lane keeping data. The imbalanced dateset would lead to trivial output of LSTM model. To deal with this problem, we propose a hierarchical over-sampling bagging method based on Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). With the proposed method, more diverse and informative instances of minority classes can be generated for training LSTM model. Furthermore, we also propose a sampling technique to keep the temporal information and make the proposed method applicable to sequential data. Moreover, to further improve the prediction performance, we also take the interactions between neighboring vehicles into account by concatenating their trajectories when constructing features. We evaluate our method against several baseline algorithms over two benchmark datasets and the empirical results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method in terms of the indexes of prediction time, F1, and G-mean.}

In this paper, we propose to use vessel and develop optimal vessel routing network to collect macro-marine debris on the nearshore surface. Due to the integrated force of winds and ocean currents, debris constantly changes floating location in the ocean. Advanced remote sensing technology and General National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Operational Modeling Environment (GNOME) software are employed to identify debris locations and track the drifting trajectory, respectively. In order to balance collecting efficiency and vessel emission reduction, we propose a bi-objective mixed integer nonlinear programming model for vessel routing to minimize travel time and carbon emission, considering time window at debris location, vessel capacity, low/medium/high vessel speed, and cost including carbon tax. A novel pheromone heuristic adaptive large neighborhood search (PHALNS ) algorithm combined with archived multi-objective simulated annealing (AMOSA) mechanism is developed to solve the proposed model. The Yangtze River Estuary region is taken as a numerical example to verify the proposed model and algorithm. Six criterions are introduced to evaluate the best collection time, and the proposed algorithm is also compared with NSGA II algorithm. The results show that low carbon emission and cost effective could be achieved simultaneously, and vessel speed has larger impact than the route scheme.}

CAV technologies are being developed rapidly and they are foreseen to penetrate the market at a rapid pace. On the other hand, work zones (WZs) have become common areas on highway systems as a result of the increasing construction and maintenance activities. The near future will therefore bring the coexistence of CAVs and WZs which makes their interaction inevitable. WZs expose all vehicles to a sudden and complex geometric change in the roadway environment, something that may challenge many of CAV navigation capabilities. WZs however also impose a space contraction resulting in adverse traffic impacts, something that legitimately calls for benefiting from the highly efficient CAV functions. CAVs should be able to reliably traverse WZ geometry and WZs should benefit from CAV intelligent functions. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art and the key concepts, opportunities, and challenges of deploying CAV systems at WZs. The reviewed subjects include traffic performance and behaviour, technologies and infrastructure, and regulatory considerations. Eighteen CAV mobility, safety, and environmental concepts and functions were distributed over the WZ area which was subdivided into five segments: further upstream, approach area, queuing area, WZ activity, and termination area. In addition, among other topics reviewed and discussed are detection of WZ features, smart traffic control devices, various technologies at connected WZs, cross-border harmonization, liability, insurance, and privacy.

With a rise in popularity of FCEVs and increased governmental grants and funding, investments in hydrogen refueling stations gain attractiveness for fuel station providers. However, as uncertainty around adoption rates and emerging competition between station providers persists, careful location selection becomes crucial for providers willing to invest in hydrogen fuel stations. We formulate a location problem for hydrogen fuel stations as a competitive flow-capture location–allocation model. In contrast to prior formulations, no prior knowledge of competitor locations is required as we expect competitors to choose locations simultaneously in an emerging competitive environment. We solve the arising competitive model formulation as an integer programming game (IPG). In a real-world scenario, we identify optimal locations for the two largest competing fuel station providers in Munich, Germany. Within this study, providers who acknowledge the existence of their competitor can realize an increase in profit of 17\% (averaged across different scenarios of FCEV market penetration & customer preferences). Central coordination (e.g., through conditional subsidies from policymakers) or cooperation between the competitors (e.g., through provider associations) could further increase overall profits by 28\%, however this increase in profitability comes at the cost of overall customer travel distance (increased by up to 10\% in case of cooperation between providers) as the average detour a customer has to take to refuel increases.}

The method is traffic-responsive, does not require data communication between intersections’ controllers, uses lane-based queue measurements, and is acyclic. Each traffic controller operating at an intersection aims at maximizing the effective outflow rate locally and independently with the goal of maximizing global throughput of the entire network. At each intersection, the signal control method estimates and adopts the maximum possible phase time in which all active movements discharge at their full capacity. This is modeled using a shockwave based queue length estimation model while capturing the spillback at the downstream links. The method demands real-time data including, the queue lengths, the arrival flows, and the downstream queue lengths in all the lanes at the control decision times. The proposed method results in a feasible solution in all conditions in the entire network with any scale within a short amount of time. A stability concept for the traffic network is defined, and asymptotic stability of the controlled traffic network are verified. Moreover, a sufficient condition for the optimality of the proposed control algorithm for maximizing the instantaneous total throughput of the network intersections is demonstrated. Numerical results show that the proposed method outperforms benchmark methods in both isolated intersection and network configurations.}

Inevitably, the observed link flows are subject to measurement errors, which will accumulate and propagate in the inference of unobserved link flows. This study aims to identify the minimum observed link set for the installation of counting sensors to reach full link flow observability, while minimizing the effect of sensor measurement errors on the inference of unobserved link flows. We propose a network sensor location model considering the propagation of measurement errors in the link flow inference process. Mathematically, we formulate the problem as min–max and min-sum integer linear programs. The objective function attempts directly to minimize the accumulated inference errors caused by the propagation of sensor measurement errors. When the sensors have the uniform measurement error, it is equivalent to minimizing the maximum or cumulative number of observed links required for the link flow inference of each or all unobserved links. The genetic algorithm (GA) is adopted to solve the proposed optimization model, and the results commend the optimal sensor location scheme with the minimum inference error for full link flow observability. The approach is useful for deploying long-term planning and link-based applications in traffic networks.}

Faced with this complexity, research has focused on machine learning as a way to capture spatio-temporal traffic patterns, based on past sensor data. While the methods can accurately forecast high-dimensional observations, it is often hard to explain the models and their predictions. In many cases, only the predictive performance of an otherwise black box model is evaluated. An accurate but explainable alternative is provided by the Koopman operator, an emerging methodology for data-driven identification of high-dimensional and nonlinear dynamical systems. In this study, we showcase the method by analyzing pedestrian traffic data from Melbourne, Australia. We formulate our computations in the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition framework, where we approximate the Koopman operator in a function basis computed with time delay embedding and the Diffusion Map algorithm. The model captures the distinct temporal patterns of 11 traffic sensors simultaneously. Because the dynamics become linear in the operator-theoretic perspective, we can decompose the model into its spectral components. Importantly, these components facilitate interpretation and can increase scientific understanding of the underlying system and the model’s operations. For the Melbourne data, we show that the spectral components connect to the underlying state space geometry and indicate the model’s stability over a prediction horizon. Our study showcases how the Koopman operator framework offers explainable and accurate data-driven predictions in a real-world traffic system. The results can easily be transferred to other traffic systems.}

A representation for jointly distributed continuous link travel times across the entire network with time-varying distributions and correlation structures is presented, and the crucial characteristics and methodological difficulties of the problem are discussed. The paper presents a generalized 2-stage path and strategy finding solution approach that can serve for finding both exact and approximate solutions with the tuning of a risk-level tolerance parameter. The first stage of the solution approach generates eligible paths, where the risk-level parameter is used to eliminate paths that are likely to be inefficient. The second stage finds reliable trajectory-adaptive strategies, using the eligible paths only, based on one or multiple reliability-based optimality conditions. Thus, the approach allows the user to determine the optimal strategy for one or multiple groups of travelers with different reliability preferences. Numerical experiments show that the average running time of the algorithm reduces super-linearly with the increase of the risk-tolerance parameter ∊, while incurring some loss to the objective function relative to the exact solution. Thus, the heuristic can offer significant benefits in reducing the run time of the solution algorithm, while finding adaptive strategy solutions that consistently maintain better objective function values compared to the a priori (i.e., non-adaptive) solutions.}

To deeply investigate the microscopic behaviors, the geometrical characteristics of Voronoi diagrams and velocity obstacles are explored and a unified spatial tessellation and velocity obstacle approach is proposed. The personal space is divided into four regions, and a velocity graph that is a subgraph of Delaunay triangulation will be established to describe the relationship between pedestrians. In a velocity graph, a link represents that a pedestrian’s speed is towards a Voronoi edge of its neighbor. According to the experimental pedestrian trajectory data, the collision avoidance probability is relevant to some parameters, such as spatial conflict time, and minimal velocity difference. Results show that the probability is related to the distance to velocity obstacle boundary and relaxation time by Sigmoid function. Besides, the behavior dynamics in each region is analyzed, and it is determined by the deviation angles between Voronoi nodes and neighbor locations. This approach can be potentially applied to pedestrian behavioral analysis and crowd management.}

abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, the collapse of the public transit ridership led to significant budget deficits due to dramatic decreases in fare revenues. Additionally, public transit agencies are facing challenges of reduced vehicle capacity due to social distancing requirements, additional costs of cleaning and protective equipment, and increased downtime for vehicle cleaning. Due to these constraints on resources and budgets, many transit agencies have adopted essential service plans with reduced service hours, number of routes, or frequencies. This paper studies the resiliency during a pandemic of On-Demand Multimodal Transit Systems (ODMTS), a new generation of transit systems that combine a network of high-frequency trains and buses with on-demand shuttles to serve the first and last miles and act as feeders to the fixed network. It presents a case study for the city of Atlanta and evaluates ODMTS for multiple scenarios of depressed demand and social distancing representing various stages of the pandemic. The case study relies on an optimization pipeline that provides an end-to-end ODMTS solution by bringing together methods for demand estimation, network design, fleet sizing, and real-time dispatching. These methods are adapted to work in a multimodal setting and to satisfy practical constraints. In particular, a limit is imposed on the number of passenger transfers, and a new network design model is introduced to avoid the computational burden stemming from this constraint. Real data from the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) is used to conduct the case study, and the results are evaluated with a high-fidelity simulation. The case study demonstrates how ODMTS provide a resilient solution in terms of cost, convenience, and accessibility for this wide range of scenarios.}

abstract = {This paper addresses a new electricity-charging station location problem for congested intercity or regional networks, in which electric vehicles with a limited driving range require recharges for their long-distance trips. When the distribution of charging stations does not sufficiently cover all used routes, some drivers may take a detour to find charging opportunities (or switch to another transportation mode). The goal of this station location problem is to find, under a limited construction budget, an optimal set of charging station locations such that all vehicles finish their trips by choosing a self-optimal route with necessary charging opportunities while the overall network congestion caused by possible detours is minimized. The problem is written as a bi-level mixed nonlinear integer programming model, where the upper level of the model is set to regulate the selection of station locations subject to the construction budget while the lower level is used to characterize the equilibrium flow pattern of electric vehicles with the charging requirement. Selected exact and approximate algorithms, namely, the branch-and-bound algorithm and the nested partitions algorithm are adopted to solve this station location problem. While both algorithms imply a divide-and-conquer strategy, the branch-and-bound algorithm poses a deterministic, exact procedure that utilizes the bounding mechanism to prune impossible solution subspaces, whereas the nested partitions algorithm performs a stochastic search and selection process in terms of the optimality probability for near-optimal solutions. To get numerical insights on the algorithmic performance and solution behavior, we test these algorithms through a couple of benchmark network instances. A performance comparison of the algorithms indicates that, the branch-and-bound algorithm can quickly obtain the global optimum when the driving range is relatively low, while the nested partitions algorithm can find optimal solutions or extremely near-optimal solutions in all cases and typically spend on average only one fourth of the computing time of the branch-and-bound algorithm. The network flow solutions clearly show, compared to gasoline vehicle drivers, how an insufficient driving range or number of charging stations may significantly reduce the number of feasible paths and force electric vehicle drivers to choose more costly paths, which thus reshapes flow patterns and possibly increases congestion levels.}

Among all controlled airspace, the Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA) is one of the most complex areas in which flight safety can be easily affected by unpredictable disturbances. This paper addresses an aircraft scheduling problem under uncertainty with the aim of providing a robust schedule for arrival flights. Uncertainty quantification and propagation along the routes are realized in a trajectory model that formulates the time information as random variables. Conflict detection and resolution are performed at waypoints of a predefined network based on the predicted time information from the trajectory model. By minimizing the expected number of conflicts, consecutively operated flights can be well separated. Apart from the proposed model, two other models - the deterministic model and a model that incorporates separation buffers - are presented as benchmarks. A meta-heuristic simulated annealing algorithm combined with a time decomposition sliding window is proposed for solving a case study of the Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG) airport. Further, a simulation framework based on the Monte-Carlo approach is implemented so as to evaluate the optimized solutions obtained from the three models. Statistical comparison among the results shows instability of the model that incorporates the separation buffers, in contrast, the proposed model has absolute advantages in both stability and the conflict absorbing ability when uncertainty arises.}

On the other hand, unlike fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters, the electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft have different operating processes and limited battery energy supply. Long flight times in the terminal area pose a risk of exhaustion and great safety challenges. Given the terminal area of the multi-vertiport system (MVS-TA), this paper investigates the adaptive control system (ACS), which includes the design of the operating environment and the integrated scheduling model. The design of the operating environment is the basis of adaptive management, which consists of the concept of multi-ring structure and the junction control rules based on backpressure policy. Considering the power constraint and dynamic priority, an integrated model including path planning model and distributed sequencing model is constructed to solve the cooperative scheduling problem of approach-departure flights. Results from numerical analyses reveal that: First, in the case of large flight flow, ACS can achieve the efficiency and safety of MVS-TA operation better than the traditional control system. Secondly, the flight density into the terminal area has a greater impact on ACS performance relative to flight volume. With a density of less than 120 flights/hour, the operating efficiency of MVS-TA under ACS varies within 10.3\% with the number of flights or density.}

This study is to solve the whole day multimodal path planning problem considering user-specific modal preference, which can be used on the recommended system of the MaaS platform. The mathematical formulations of the whole day multimodal shortest hyperpath problem are proposed while accounting for individual constraints, such as the time window, multicriteria, and park-and-ride demands, to develop customized travel schemes. The primary obstacle involves consideration of the travelers’ modal preferences to develop an optimal whole day journey. The dynamic discrete choice model (DDCM) that accounts for unobservable heterogeneity is proposed to characterize dynamic mode choice behavior and generate a set of feasible mode chains. The conditional choice probability estimator and expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm are used in conjunction to estimate the dynamic model. In this way, the posterior probability can be adapted to the conditional choice probability estimation. The label correcting concept is used to develop a user-constrained shortest hyperpath algorithm that can solve the multimodal shortest hyperpath problem and calculate the Pareto set of the whole day travel schemes according to the feasible mode chains and different constraints. The proposed techniques are verified by utilizing household travel survey data and multimodal network data in Nanjing (China). Two unobserved states of travelers, namely time- and cost-sensitive, are identified based on the BIC value. The adjusted rho-squared value, accuracies of predicted mode chains, along with the aggregate validation results, confirm the model’s effectiveness. The top two resulting hyperpaths are generated for a randomly chosen traveler on the basis of his or her preferences. This study is an important step toward promoting MaaS and improving the sales of MaaS bundles.}

Most of the existing lane change prediction models cannot update their model to adapt to the change of road and traffic environment, such as free and congested traffic environments and roads with different levels. Thus, those models cannot be robust. This paper aims to break this limitation and builds a lane change prediction model for surrounding vehicles based on machine learning methods. The lane change prediction model contains a basic model and an adaptive model: the basic model is a long short-term memory (LSTM) based prediction model which reflects the decision-making mode for drivers; the adaptive prediction model embeds an adaptive decision threshold on the basic model, and the threshold updates by Bayesian Inference method on time. We prove the performance of the adaptive model based on the HighD dataset, and the results are inspiring that the model achieves 93.64–97.52\% accuracies for target-vehicle in the left adjacent lane and 94.30–98.01\% accuracies for target-vehicle in the right adjacent lane. Besides, our proposed model is capable of different driving environments, especially when the traditional LSTM method cannot capture drivers’ lane change decision well. Because of the timeliness and transferability nature of our proposed model, this model could be applied to the Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles in the future to reduce driving perception errors.}

However, the existing traditional measurement approaches are highly time-consuming and expensive to continuously gather the required data and to maintain the corresponding equipment, such as loop detectors and video cameras. On the other hand, many services on the web propose to estimate automobile travel time taking into account traffic conditions thanks to crowd sourced data (Floating Car Data). This work proposes to reconstruct, from estimated travel time, traffic flows using machine learning method. In particular, we evaluate the capacity of Gaussian Process Regressor (GPR) to address this issue. After obtaining estimated travel time on a given route, a clustering process shows that travel duration profiles in each day can be associated to different “types of day”. Then, different regressors are trained in order to estimate traffic flows from travel duration. In the “multi-model” variant, we trained a Regressor for each type of day. Conversely, in the “single model” variant, only one Regressor is trained (the type of day is not taken into account). This is an innovative work to estimate and reconstruct the traffic flow in transportation networks with machine learning method from aggregated Floating Car Data (FCD). A series of experiments are conducted to compare the estimated traffic flows, obtained by the proposed single model and multi-model, and the real ones from actual sensors. The obtained results show that both single model and multi-models can capture the tendency of real traffic flows. Furthermore, the performance can be improved by regulating parameters in GPR machine learning model, such as half width of sample window and sample size (a whole week or only weekdays), and multi-models can highly increase the performance compared with the single model. Therefore, the proposed GPR machine learning and FCD based new method can replace those traditional loop detectors for the measurement of traffic flow.}

We call such a mobility market with AV renting options the “AV crowdsourcing market”. This paper establishes an aggregate equilibrium model with multiple transport modes to analyze the AV crowdsourcing market. The modeling framework can capture the customers’ mode choices and AV owners’ rental decisions with the presence of traffic congestion. Then, we explore different scenarios that either maximize the crowdsourcing platform’s profit or maximize social welfare. Gradient-based optimization algorithms are designed for solving the problems. The results obtained by numerical examples reveal the welfare enhancement and the strong profitability of the AV crowdsourcing service. However, when the crowdsourcing scale is small, the crowdsourcing platform might not be profitable. A second-best pricing scheme is able to avoid such undesirable cases. The insights generated from the analyses provide guidance for regulators, service providers and citizens to make future decisions regarding the utilization of the AV crowdsourcing markets for serving the good of the society.}

However, for modelling vehicle turning behaviour, potential conflicts involving diagonal-crossing motorcycles are seldom investigated in existing studies. To explore these scenes, we present a novel interaction-aware deep-learning framework. Firstly, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based network is employed to encode vehicle historical motion features. Secondly, each vehicle’s potential target lanes are identified with a probabilistic method, followed by a pooling module that extracts and summarizes intention features. Thirdly, Graph Attention Network (GAT) and a synthesized network are introduced to model vehicle-vehicle interaction and vehicle-motorcycle interaction respectively. Finally, multiple kinds of obtained features are sent to a LSTM based decoder module, where both future displacement and body orientation of vehicles are predicted. In short-time simulation experiments, average displacement error is reduced by 47.7\% and 20.0\% compared to baseline and state-of-the-art methods, with ablation studies conducted to quantify the efficacy of each kind of feature. Moreover, regarding recursive simulation, our model shows availability of reproducing lane-selecting and motorcycle-evasive behaviours. Distributions of post-encroachment time further indicate that the proposed framework can serve as a promising method to realize reliable motion planning for autonomous vehicles.}

abstract = {Safety is a top priority for civil aviation. Data mining in digital Flight Data Recorder (FDR) or Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data, commonly referred to as black box data on aircraft, has gained interest for proactive safety management. New anomaly detection methods, primarily clustering methods, have been developed to monitor pilot operations and detect any risks from such flight data. However, all existing anomaly detection methods are offline learning — the models are trained once using historical data and used for all future predictions. In practice, new flight data are accumulated continuously and analyzed every month at airlines. Clustering such dynamically growing data is challenging for an offline method because it is memory and time intensive to re-train the model every time new data come in. If the model is not re-trained, false alarms or missed detections may increase since the model cannot reflect changes in data patterns. To address this problem, we propose a novel incremental anomaly detection method based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to identify common patterns and detect outliers in flight operations from digital flight data. It is a probabilistic clustering model of flight operations that can incrementally update its clusters based on new data rather than to re-cluster all data from scratch. It trains an initial GMM model based on historical offline data. Then, it continuously adapts to new incoming data points via an expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm. To track changes in flight operation patterns, only model parameters need to be saved, not the raw flight data. The proposed method was tested on three sets of simulation data and two sets of real-world flight data. Compared with the traditional offline GMM method, the proposed method can generate similar clustering results with significantly reduced processing time (57 \%–99 \% time reduction in testing sets) and memory usage (91 \%–95 \% memory usage reduction in testing sets). Preliminary results indicate that the incremental learning scheme is effective in dealing with dynamically growing data in flight data analytics.}

To plan such reliable transfers from e.g. busses to trains, it is crucial to know the necessary walking times from stops to platforms. This paper presents an innovative approach for estimation of walking time distributions from bus stops to train platforms based on a matching of smart card data and automatic vehicle location data. The observed times from bus stop to rail platform turns out to have a large variance, due to two reasons: differences in passenger walking speeds, and passengers who are doing activities during the transfer. To account for these variations a hierarchical Bayesian mixture model is applied, where the time for passengers walking directly and passengers doing activities during the transfer follows separate distributions. The proposed methodology is applied to 129 stations in the Eastern part of Denmark, where the tap-in devices are located at the train platform. Results from two stations with different characteristics are presented in details along with justifications and analyses of model accuracy. The outcome of the model with distributions of the necessary walking times from bus stops to train platforms is important input for timetabling connections, and the data-driven methodology can easily be applied at scale.}

abstract = {In urban networks, traffic congestion can be curbed by deconcentrating the temporal distribution of the travel demand. In this paper, we propose an optimal staggered work schedules problem to minimize the network total travel time and prevent the schedule delay in the trips of commuters over morning peaks in a bicentric network. The objective is to optimize the work start times of individual firms with minimum deviations from their initial schedules while taking into account that commuters choose their departure time selfishly to minimize their travel cost. We formulate the optimal work schedule problem in a bicentric network as a multi-objective optimization program that simultaneously minimizes the total travel time and the schedule deviation for the firms while satisfying near-equilibrium temporal conditions. The time-varying congestion dynamics are modeled using macroscopic fundamental diagrams. We solve the optimization problem for a test network and analyze the sensitivity of the Pareto solution to the policy parameters of the model. We assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method using an individual-level trip-based macroscopic simulation model. The numerical results demonstrate that implementing the proposed optimal staggered work schedules strategy accounting for commuters’ departure trip time choice can significantly reduce the traffic congestion in urban networks.}

abstract = {Household travel survey data is a critical input to travel behavior modeling, and it also can be used to generate trip schedules for activity-based traffic simulation. With emerging information and communication technology (ICT) tools like smartphones, the collection of passive datasets for travelers’ real-time information becomes available. Smartphone GPS survey apps have emerged to be a popular tool for conducting household travel surveys. Most existing studies employ high-frequency smartphone GPS data and collect accurate activity information. However, their study periods are still rather short, ranging from a few days to a few weeks. For a long-term GPS survey, the issues of missing activity information and sparse GPS data are inevitable and must be addressed carefully. This paper uses 7-month low-frequency smartphone GPS data collected from over 2000 participants, who report 5 most frequently visited locations weekly. The essential goal is to develop a synthetic model of daily activity-location scheduling to capture data with both known and unknown activities. To handle missing activity data, this research develops a new probabilistic approach, which measures the probability of visiting a place by three scores, global visit score (GVS), temporal visit score (TVS), and periodical visit score (PVS). Three different levels of activity-location schedule are modeled respectively. The first level handles only those data with known activities, while data with unknown activities are disregarded. The second takes unknown activities into account but combines all types of them into a single category. The third one models each location with unknown activities separately. These models are able to generate activity-location schedule in different levels of detail for activity-based traffic simulator. After developing activity-location schedule models, both individual and aggregated validation processes are performed with simulation. The validation result shows that the simulated proportion of activity types and activity duration are close to the survey data, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. This research sheds a light on building sustainable and long-term travel survey using GPS data with missing activity information. In addition, this study will be valuable to model infectious disease transmission, e.g. COVID-19 and assess health risk in urban areas.}

When encountering an unconnected preceding vehicle, CACCu enables a Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) to benefit from communicating with a connected vehicle further ahead, rather than completely falling back to Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC). To validate the feasibility of CACCu, this study developed and tested a CACCu system with real vehicles in the field. A speed-command-based CACCu controller is designed and parameterized for optimizing the anticipated string stability. The experiment was conducted with two automated vehicles equipped with Mobileye sensors and Wi-Fi modules. The car-following performance of CACCu, in comparison with ACC and human driving (as the ego vehicle), was evaluated in the real-traffic scenarios constructed using NGSIM vehicle trajectory data. Over the 6 test runs for each control method, it was found that CACCu reduced 10.8\% acceleration Root Mean Square (RMS), 60.8\% spacing error RMS and 6.2\% fuel consumption from ACC’s, indicating advantages of CACCu in control accuracy, ride comfort and energy efficiency. Compared with human driving, CACCu also reduced 17.6\% acceleration and 13.4\% fuel consumption. More importantly, the CACCu was able to efficiently avoid the traffic disturbance amplifications that frequently happened to ACC and human driving, which means the string stability has been significantly improved by the CACCu.}

As a result, strategies based on a centralized framework are not scalable. The use of decentralized signal control strategies for large-scale urban traffic networks is a solution to this problem, since it allows for the implementation of such strategies on networks whose centralized solution is not easily scalable. This paper addresses the problem of designing a decentralized traffic-responsive signal control solution, proposing two methods based on different formulations of the store-and-forward model: (i) the Decentralized Traffic-responsive Urban Control (DTUC) method; and (ii) the Decentralized Decoupled Traffic-responsive Urban Control (D2TUC). The decentralized configuration is such that each intersection is associated with one computational unit, with limited computational power and memory, which controls the traffic signals of the incoming links. Sufficient conditions for the controllability of the considered store-and-forward models are also presented. Both methods are validated resorting to numerical simulations of the urban traffic network of Chania, Greece, for two demand scenarios, and their performance is compared with the performance of the Traffic-responsive Urban Control (TUC) centralized strategy. One of the proposed decentralized methods, D2TUC, is shown to match the performance of TUC.}

abstract = {Although researchers increasingly adopt machine learning to model travel behavior, they predominantly focus on prediction accuracy, ignoring the ethical challenges embedded in machine learning algorithms. This study introduces an important missing dimension - computational fairness - to travel behavior analysis. It highlights the accuracy-fairness tradeoff instead of the single dimensional focus on prediction accuracy in the contexts of deep neural network (DNN) and discrete choice models (DCM). We first operationalize computational fairness by equality of opportunity, then differentiate between the bias inherent in data and the bias introduced by modeling. The models inheriting the inherent biases can risk perpetuating the existing inequality in the data structure, and the biases in modeling can further exacerbate it. We then demonstrate the prediction disparities in travel behavior modeling using the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) and the 2018–2019 My Daily Travel Survey in Chicago. Empirically, DNN and DCM reveal consistent prediction disparities across multiple social groups: both over-predict the false negative rate of frequent driving for the ethnic minorities, the low-income and the disabled populations, and falsely predict a higher travel burden of the socially disadvantaged groups and the rural populations than reality. Comparing DNN with DCM, we find that DNN can outperform DCM in prediction disparities because of DNN’s smaller misspecification error. To mitigate prediction disparities, this study introduces an absolute correlation regularization method, which is evaluated with synthetic and real-world data. The results demonstrate the prevalence of prediction disparities in travel behavior modeling, and the disparities still persist regarding a variety of model specifics such as the number of DNN layers, batch size and weight initialization. Since these prediction disparities can exacerbate social inequity if prediction results without fairness adjustment are used for transportation policy making, we advocate for careful consideration of the fairness problem in travel behavior modeling, and the use of bias mitigation algorithms for fair transport decisions.}

abstract = {The prevalence of shared bikes in many cities is a double-edged sword to the local mass transit services. Some transit patrons may switch to cycling, causing declines in the transit ridership. Others may benefit from using bikes instead of walking to access transit. The complicated interactions between the two modes entail the necessity of designing them jointly. Unfortunately, the literature has focused on either the design of a single mode or joint designs idealized by assuming a uniform demand pattern. The latter class of works has limited practical values. This paper develops a continuum approximation (CA) model for optimizing the hybrid design of shared-bike and transit services in a corridor under spatially heterogeneous demand patterns. The model minimizes the generalized system cost considering various route options that patrons can choose from, including transit routes with walking or biking access and bike-only routes. The methodological challenges that arise due to patrons’ route choices in the heterogeneous operating environment are overcome by incorporating a route assignment model into the CA modeling framework. We propose a bi-level algorithm to solve the model, where the upper level optimizes the hybrid design by exploiting some analytical properties of the CA model, and the lower level calculates the route assignment equilibrium. Numerical experiments show that the optimal hybrid design outperforms the conventional transit design for a wide range of operating conditions. The cost saving can be over 20\%. Under certain conditions, the hybrid design can even reduce the total operating cost, making bike-sharing profitable for transit agencies. The practical applicability of our model is demonstrated via a case study of a real bus line in Chengdu, China.}

However, the inevitable data missing problem caused by various disturbances undermines the information contained in such real-time data, thereby threatening the reliability of data acquisition as well as the prediction results. Such scenarios raise a strong need for integrating the tasks of network-scale online data imputation and traffic prediction, because the existing two-step approaches that separate the above procedures cannot be implemented in an online manner. In this paper, we propose a customized spatiotemporal deep learning architecture, named the graph convolutional bidirectional recurrent neural network (GCBRNN), to combine network-scale online data imputation and traffic prediction into an integrated task. The imputation mechanism and bidirectional framework are developed to cooperatively estimate missing entries and infer future values. We further design a network-scale graph convolutional gated recurrent unit (NGC-GRU) within the GCBRNN, which applies the graph convolution operation and 1×1 convolution module to capture the spatiotemporal dependencies in the traffic data. Experiments are carried out on two real-world traffic networks, including traffic speed and flow datasets. The comparison results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms several classical benchmark models with respect to both the imputation and prediction tasks on two datasets under various missing data rates.}

A four-dimensional (4D) trajectory negotiation/synchronization process between the air traffic control officer (ATCO) and the aircraft is performed in the pre-sequencing area, while the aircraft are still in the en-route phase of flight. On the other hand, in the dynamic-trajectories area, the ATCO, with the help of a ground support tool, generates dynamic arrival routes that automatically adapt to the current traffic demand. These arrival routes allow the aircraft to fly neutral continuous descent operations (CDOs, descents with idle thrust and no speed-brakes usage) and to ensure a separation throughout the arrival procedure. We choose a mixed-integer-programming approach to generate the arrival routes, while we formulate and solve an optimal control problem to generate a set of candidate CDOs per aircraft. Results show that, with a sufficient look-ahead time, it is possible to assign a required time of arrival (RTA) within each aircraft-arrival time window that would allow to efficiently schedule traffic even in the most challenging and dense scenarios. Besides improving efficiency of current operations in terminal airspace, the methodology presented in this paper could become a technical enabler towards an extended arrival manager (E-AMAN) with extended capabilities and, ultimately, to a fully deployed trajectory based operations (TBO) environment.}

This problem is formulated as a 0–1 mixed-integer program with the objective of maximizing the total throughput of both runways, taking into account several realistic constraints including safety separation standards, wide time-windows, and constrained position shifting. This NP-hard problem is computationally harder than its single runway counterpart due to the additional runway allocation decisions. Recognising the intractability of peak-traffic instances of this problem by direct application of the MIP formulation, a novel application of data-splitting algorithm (DS-ASP) is proposed to the case of two runways scenario. DS-ASP divides the given set of flights into several disjoint subsets, and then optimises each of them using 0–1 MIP while ensuring the optimality of the entire set. Computational results show a significant reduction in average solution time (by more than 92\% in some scenarios) compared to direct use of a commercial solver while achieving optimality in all of the instances. Capable of producing real-time solutions for various peak-traffic instances even with sequential implementation, pleasingly parallel structure further enhances its efficiency and scalability.}

Then, a space–time network-based modeling framework is proposed to integrate human mobility into network location design problems. We construct a probabilistic network structure to quantify human’s presence probability at different locations and time. Then, a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) model is proposed to maximize the spatial and temporal coverage of individual targets. To obtain near optimal solutions for large-scale problems, greedy heuristic, simulated annealing and Lagrangian relaxation algorithms are tested. Theoretical analysis is conducted to show the optimality gap of the greedy algorithm. The proposed algorithms are implemented on hypothetical and real-world numerical examples (some on a high-performance computing platform) to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed model on different network sizes and promising results have been obtained.}

Importantly, decision makers need to answer the question on the number and location of charging stations in a way to satisfy customer recharging demand and meet certain restrictions imposed by real-life considerations. In this context, we consider the charging station location problem (CSLP), which belongs to the category of facility location problems and seeks to optimize the locations of charging stations. A growing body of literature has developed on this subject in recent years. Various approaches have been proposed to model the problem taking into account different features, constraints, decisions and performance measures as well as the dynamic and stochastic components inherent to the problem. Moreover, efficiently solving CSLP, particularly when applied to real-life case-studies, might be challenging in practice. Considerable effort has thus been made by researchers to develop innovative solution methods based on exact or heuristic approaches to obtain good quality solutions within short computation times. Therefore, we provide in this paper a comprehensive review on the literature relevant to CSLP, with a particular focus on modeling and solving the problem. We analyze the literature from different perspectives including demand representation, demand coverage approaches, objective functions, side constraints, decision variables, model structure as well as time dependency and uncertainty on the problem parameters. We also present various ways of classifying existing works, which allows readers to capture different aspects of the problem that researchers have tended to focus on and identify opportunities for further developments. We believe our work could be helpful to researchers by providing an overview of the CSLP literature and suggesting perspectives for future research in the field.}

Considering that MFD accumulation-based models have been integrated in perimeter control approaches, this work tackles the real-time estimation problem when limited data is available. An estimation engine is developed according to the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) theory; it seeks to estimate the real state of the multi-region dynamic system based on traffic sensors’ measurements. First, a stochastic model is presented for the dynamics of the process (plant). Then, the EKF estimation scheme is described based on a simpler aggregated model of dynamics and some real-time measurements. Estimation accuracy is investigated through detailed micro-simulation of downtown Barcelona by studying a realistic configuration of real-time measurement availability through loop detector data; however, the developed methodology is generic. The state vector we seek to estimate, as well as the available measurements configuration, can be altered according to the application. The proposed methodology is tested both in macro- and micro-simulation; resulting estimated traffic states (i.e., regional accumulations, demands, and distribution of outflows) are compared to actual ones obtained from the stochastic plant. The developed algorithm can be utilized by closed-loop online urban traffic management strategies to feed the estimated traffic state back to the controller.}

Last-Mile Transportation Systems (LMTS), which have recently emerged, provide on-demand shared transportation.

Specifically, we consider the perspective of a last-mile service provider who wants to determine the number of servicing vehicles to allocate to multiple last-mile service regions in a particular city. In each service region, passengers demanding last-mile services arrive in batches, and allocated vehicles deliver passengers to their final destinations. The passenger demand (i.e., the size of each batch of passengers) is random and hard to predict in advance, especially with limited data during the planning process. The quality of fleet-allocation decisions is a function of vehicle fixed cost plus a weighted sum of passenger’s waiting time before boarding a vehicle and in-vehicle riding time. We propose and analyze two models – a stochastic programming model and a distributionally robust optimization model – to solve the problem, assuming known and unknown distribution of the demand, respectively. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to evaluate the models and discuss insights and implications into the optimal fleet sizing and allocation for the on-demand LMTS under demand uncertainty.}

A novel concept of a virtual zone is utilized to capture vehicle relocation range and client walking or biking distance constraints in one-way carsharing systems. The vehicle imbalance problem is further addressed by combining a long-term pricing strategy and real-time vehicle relocations in a two-stage stochastic programming model. In the first stage, the tactical decisions including fleet size and trip price are optimized, while anticipating the operational costs from the second stage. The second stage optimizes operational decisions under uncertain demand including vehicle relocations conditional on the tactical decisions in stage one. The model aims to maximize the profit of a carsharing company considering the fleet costs calculated in stage one and the expected operational costs and revenue obtained in stage two. A dedicated gradient search algorithm is developed to solve the two-stage stochastic programming and results are compared to a genetic algorithm and an iterated local search algorithm. The proposed model and corresponding solution approach are applied to a large-scale network with 50 zones and over 1000 vehicles in Suzhou, China. The application allows us to attain additional operational insight.

Furthermore, studies have not yet zeroed in on gauging the usability of these technologies thoroughly. We investigate, with experiments at a fine spatial scale and across multiple geographies (Singapore and Tokyo), whether we can use SVI and CV to assess bikeability comprehensively. Extending related work, we develop an exhaustive index of bikeability composed of 34 indicators. The results suggest that SVI and CV are adequate to evaluate bikeability in cities comprehensively. As they outperformed non-SVI counterparts by a wide margin, SVI indicators are also found to be superior in assessing urban bikeability and potentially can be used independently, replacing traditional techniques. However, the paper exposes some limitations, suggesting that the best way forward is combining both SVI and non-SVI approaches. The new bikeability index presents a contribution in transportation and urban analytics, and it is scalable to assess cycling appeal widely.}

abstract = {In this paper, we propose an approach that combines optimization techniques with machine learning to improve capacitated barge planning with uncertain container arrivals. The main idea is to use the predictions of a decision tree in the scenario generation of a 2-stage stochastic program to plan the barge calls (i.e. visits) of a barge operator. The predictions of container arrivals help to generate more accurate scenarios, which in turn leads to more informed decisions and less costs. The approach is tested with an iterative method of periodic planning and simulation for a one year duration so that the long term performance is evaluated. A computational experiment is conducted using the historical data of an inland terminal and the Port of Rotterdam. The results show that the proposed approach improves total costs up to 2.07\% over the traditional stochastic approach, and up to 4.57\% over the current method used in industry.}

Existing approaches have developed several routing allocation methods to address this problem, in which the taxi time traversing each segment of the taxiways is fixed. However, taxi time is typically difficult to estimate in advance, since its uncertainties are inherent in the airport ground movement optimisation due to various unmodelled and unpredictable factors. To address the optimisation of taxi time under uncertainty, we introduce a chance-constrained programming model with sample approximation, in which a set of scenarios is generated in accordance with taxi time distributions. A modified sequential quickest path searching algorithm with local heuristic is then designed to minimise the entire taxi time. Working with real-world data at an international airport, we compare our proposed method with the state-of-the-art algorithms. Extensive simulations indicate that our proposed method efficiently allocates routes with smaller taxiing time, as well as fewer aircraft stops during the taxiing process.}

The aim is to use all available information in predictions, without the limiting and arbitrary choices and dependencies resulting from a single statistical or machine learning approach or a single functional form, or results from a limited data source. Uncertainties are systematically accounted for. Outputs of ensemble models can be presented as a range of possibilities, to indicate the amount of uncertainty in modeling. We review methods and applications of ensemble models both within and outside of transport research. The review finds that ensemble forecasting generally improves forecast accuracy, robustness in many fields, particularly in weather forecasting where the method originated. We note that ensemble methods are highly siloed across different disciplines, and both the knowledge and application of ensemble forecasting are lacking in transport. In this paper we review and synthesize methods of ensemble forecasting with a unifying framework, categorizing ensemble methods into two broad and not mutually exclusive categories, namely combining models, and combining data; this framework further extends to ensembles of ensembles. We apply ensemble forecasting to transport related cases, which shows the potential of ensemble models in improving forecast accuracy and reliability. This paper sheds light on the apparatus of ensemble forecasting, which we hope contributes to the better understanding and wider adoption of ensemble models.}

To date, only a few studies have been conducted that compare how potential air taxi demand across cities varies. This study calculates a measure of air taxi demand for commuters for the 40 most populous combined statistical areas (CSAs) in the U.S. by using: (1) cell phone data to identify regular commuters in cities, (2)census data to associate household income characteristics with commuters, and (3)a mode choice model calibrated from a stated preference survey to predict the number of commuters that would use an air taxi. Air taxi commuter demand is concentrated in a handful of CSAs; the CSAs for New York City, LosAngeles, and Washington, D.C., generate 33percent of the overall air taxi demand. Results are sensitive to location of existing vertiports, existing ground infrastructure and congestion levels on competing modes, and current commute patterns. A resultant set of online maps of potential air taxi routes allows readers to visualize how air taxi commuter routes differ across CSAs. Results will be of value both to aircraft manufacturers seeking to design air taxi vehicles to serve different cities as well as city planners for identifying where investments in port infrastructure may be needed to support a commuter air taxi service.}

abstract = {An event-based parking pricing problem, the Crowdsourced Event Parking Market Pricing Problem, is proposed wherein parking lot owners and others who are willing to rent out privately owned spaces compete to attract drivers who are looking for available parking spaces. Each parking location owner’s problem is modeled as a bi-level program, where the upper-level parking garages, individuals and consolidators (the players) compete for customers, setting their prices to maximize revenue given the response of the lower-level followers. The lower-level followers choose their parking locations based on the utilities they derive from the spaces, which is a function of the proximity of the spaces to their destinations, parking fees and crowdedness. Prices are set as a function of the time of reservation. Reservation-time based pricing enables price differentiation for late comers either in the form of lower prices to attract last-minute customers when excess spaces are anticipated or higher-pricing if few spaces are expected to remain empty. A multi-period, stochastic Equilibrium Problem with Equilibrium Constraints (EPEC) formulation of the Crowdsourced Event Parking Market Pricing Problem is presented, and a diagonalization method with embedded gradient ascent approach for solution of individual player Mathematical Programs with Equilibrium Constraints (MPECs) is proposed for its solution. Both supply- and demand-side uncertainties are explicitly modeled. Solutions provide competitive parking prices set by reservation time for each parking facility, whether the facility involves a large parking garage or single parking space owner. Numerical experiments were conducted to illustrate the proposed concepts and assess the potential impact of crowdsourced parking spaces on the parking market. The results show that social welfare increases by more than 5\% when crowdsourced parking locations account for 7\% of the parking market. Results from additional numerical experiments show that ignoring stochasticity results in revenue loss for all parking owners. The developed techniques aim to facilitate existing and new parking facility owners to participate in crowdsourced event-parking markets.}

Through wireless communication and advanced sensing capabilities, CAVs can detect the surrounding traffic environment and share real-time vehicular information with each other and the infrastructure, and individual trajectories of CAVs can be precisely controlled. This paper proposes a real-time learning and control framework for signalized intersection management, which includes both signal optimization and CAV trajectory control. The proposed framework integrates perception, prediction, planning, and optimization components and aims at improving efficiency mixed connected automated traffic in terms of traffic throughput and delay. This framework applies the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks to implicitly learn traffic patterns and driver behavior and then estimate and predict the microscopic traffic conditions that are only partially observable. Then it utilizes deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve signal optimization problems by learning from the dynamic interactions between vehicles and the traffic environment. Under the proposed framework, the vehicular trajectories of CAVs can be controlled to maximize the utilization of the green time and reduce the start-up lost time by using a highly efficient trajectory planning algorithm. The CAV platooning operation, in coordination with traffic signals, is also implemented such that CAVs can pass the intersection efficiently. Simulations are performed at a signalized intersection a signalized intersection with multi-lane approaches, high traffic demand, and standard ring-barrier control, and results show that the proposed DRL-TP3 framework can significantly improve the throughput and reduce the average delay across different CAV market penetration rates (MPRs). We also investigate the impacts of different sensor capabilities of unobservable vehicle estimation and implementation of a lane change prohibition zone under the DRL-TP3 framework.}

abstract = {Recent trends in pursuing green ports have had positive effects on terminal operators constructing more eco-friendly decision schemes. A yard template in a container port not only determines the scheduling of the terminal handling equipment by container allocation, but also affects the carbon emissions from yard trucks caused by loading and unloading operations, due to the differing degree of yard road congestion. Moreover, the uncertainty regarding the number of transporting containers makes it challenging to construct a robust yard template for a container terminal. Motivated by research pointing to the need to alleviate the exhaust pollution generated by port handling equipment, this paper presents a two-stage stochastic programming model for yard template planning, with the aim of minimizing the maintenance and manpower costs of activating yard cranes for container handling and of reducing the carbon dioxide emitted from yard trucks. More specifically, the paper considers the impact of road congestion on carbon dioxide emissions from the perspective of the increase in transportation time caused by yard truck interruptions. The uncertainty regarding the number of transport containers is reflected by taking into account numerous scenarios in which different numbers of containers are loaded onto (discharged from) vessels that visit the port periodically. In addition, an improved Benders decomposition-based solution method is designed to solve the proposed model with large-scale problem instances. Several experiments are performed to validate the effectiveness of the model and the efficiency of the method. The numerical results demonstrate that yard template planning that considers road congestion can effectively reduce the carbon emissions of yard trucks in loading and unloading operations.}

abstract = {The paper develops a simulation model and evaluates fixed versus on-demand operational designs of a station-based automated feeder service. The evaluation considers the operational cost and average passenger level-of-service trade-offs as well as distributional differences in waiting times. Two case studies are used to evaluate such trade-offs under different fleet compositions; (1) a simple circular network feeder service; (2) a case based on a real-world coordinated branched service in Stockholm, combining fixed-line services on the trunk portion with a flexible feeder service on the branches. Results for the circular network indicate that there are benefits in utilizing an on-demand operational policy for the lowest and highest demand levels tested. When fixed service capacity is exceeded, it is found that there are potential benefits in on-demand operations with respect to average level-of-service, as well as delivering a more even distribution of passenger waiting times. Results for the real-world case show that combining DRT on branches with fixed services on the trunk improves the overall median waiting times for all DRT scenarios and provides substantial improvements for passengers on the trunk, at the cost of more variable, and less equitable waiting times on the branches. For larger fleet sizes, generalized travel costs are reduced with and without rebalancing and level-of-service provided to branch-to-branch passengers is improved considerably by rebalancing idling vehicles to branch end-stops. The case studies demonstrate the usefulness of the simulation framework in evaluating trade-offs between fixed and on-demand service design variables and their effects on disaggregate level-of-service provided for stop-based feeder services.}

This is achieved by introducing the q-generalization of McFadden’s multivariate Gumbel distribution. Thus, the logit model is doubly generalized; 1) each utility follows the generalized extreme value distribution that includes the Gumbel, Weibull, and Fréchet distributions; and 2) the utility distribution is multivariate, and therefore, a nested or cross-nested structure and dependency of alternatives are allowed. The proposed doubly generalized logit model system allows for deriving new closed-form discrete choice models such as the q-generalized nested logit model and q-generalized cross-nested logit (CNL) model. Furthermore, the model system includes conventional logit models such as the multinomial logit, nested logit, and CNL models as special cases as well as the new generalized logit models, while retaining a closed-form expression. We empirically confirm that the goodness-of-fit of the proposed model could be substantially better compared to that of the conventional models in some cases, though the degree of improvements varies across cases.}

abstract = {The network sensor location problem (NSLP) for origin–destination (OD) estimation identifies the optimal locations for sensors to estimate the vehicular flow of OD pairs in a road network. Like other measurement apparatuses, these sensors are subject to failure, which can affect the reliability of the OD estimations. In this paper, we propose a novel model that allows us to solve the NSLP for OD demand estimation by identifying the most reliable locations to install sets of sensors with consideration for a nonhomogeneous Poisson process to account for time-dependent sensor failure. The proposed model does not rely on the assumption that true OD demand information is known. We introduce two separate objective functions to minimize the maximum possible information loss (MPIL) associated with OD demand on sensor-equipped links and OD pairs during the lifetimes of the sensors. Both objective functions are formulated to incorporate the possibility of sensor failure into the calculated OD demands. We use stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) to address the stochasticity of traffic route selection. We then employ the weighted sums method (WSM) and an ε-constraint to incorporate the objective functions into an integrated formulation. Two sensor types with different time-dependent failure rates are considered to identify the optimal locations for sets of sensors for OD demand estimation purposes while addressing the available budget constraints. We also address the problem of scheduled/routine maintenance of existing sensors by introducing an additional sensor deployment phase that focuses on maintaining the reliability of information by repairing or replacing failed sensors, installing additional sensors or a combination of both. The numerical results from the proposed model demonstrate how the deployment of more advanced sensors with lower failure rates can effectively improve the reliability of the information obtained from sensors. We also evaluate the use of different weights for the WSM’s objective functions to explore alternative combinations of sensor configurations. The introduction of additional sensors to a network shows that the decision between repairing failed sensors and installing new sensors is highly dependent on the available budget and the failed sensors’ locations.}

They use and benefit from the technological advances brought by automation while being already implementable at larger scale under the current regulations and within the existing urban environment. In this paper, we present a new type of semi-autonomous transportation system referred to as Multi-Layered Personal Transit System (MuLPeTS). It consists of convoys composed of one human-driven lead vehicle guiding several autonomous small capacity trailers in which the passengers travel. These trailers can detach from a convoy and travel autonomously in a protected environment before attaching later to another convoy. The interest of this transportation concept is threefold: (i) this assembly of vehicles is able and allowed to move in mixed-traffic conditions whereas fully autonomous driving is still largely restricted; (ii) a trailer can travel autonomously in the vicinity of stations to pick-up and drop-off passengers while the convoy it was previously part of continues its route without further delay; and (iii) passengers complete their entire journey on board a single trailer, that is they avoid the need to transfer. We analyze how this new type of transportation system relates to existing alternatives and propose an operational concept for it, in which we account for passenger assignment, lead vehicle routes and trailer movements, including empty trailer relocation. We extensively test this concept within a purpose-built simulation environment to evaluate the performance of this kind of system based on real-world data instances. The results highlight the most promising operational policies and characterize favorable system configurations.}

abstract = {Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) is an emerging concept for transporting people and cargo in urban, rural, regional, and interregional settings using revolutionary new aircraft. Urban Air Mobility (UAM), a part of AAM, focused on transport passengers in low-altitude urban airspace, has attracted extensive attention among industry, government, academia, and the public. Compared to existing commercial flights, AAM operations are expected to be at higher density; thus, an AAM system needs to be scalable, safe, and autonomous. Third-party service providers are recommended for offering air traffic management and information sharing services given the anticipated high density of UAM operations. To this end, we propose an Automated Flight Planning System (AFPS) that could be employed by such service providers. In the AFPS, a Low-Altitude Airspace Management System (LAMS) is proposed to automatically generate a route network with the capability of avoiding obstacles and obstructions in low-altitude airspace. The main components of this tool are the generation of a 3D map with LiDAR data, construction of a nodal network based on the map by using the visibility graph method, and initiation of 3D shortest paths. Given the requests of flight operations, i.e., origin, destination, departure time, the Low-Altitude Traffic Management System (LTMS) will design pre-departure conflict-free 4D trajectories and provide flexibilities of en-route maneuvering by taking system cost and equity among operators into consideration. In this study, a flight-level assignment strategy is proposed to solve the trajectory deconfliction problem in LTMS. In addition, a Nash Social Welfare Program (NSWP) is introduced to maintain fairness among different operators if the service is provided to multiple operators of UAM. A case study of the Tampa Bay area in Florida is used to demonstrate the operability of the proposed AFPS, and animations are built to visualize the optimized conflict-free operations of UAM in the study area.}

The method consists of two levels, i.e. constraint-tree-driven modeling (CTM) strategy for the supervision level and distributed robust control (DRC) method for the execution level. After projecting the approaching vehicles to a virtual lane, the CTM strategy determines the conflict-free passing sequence and driving mode and forms multiple local virtual platoons (LVP). A constraint tree is then constructed, in which constraints with a unified equality formation are utilized to describe the geometry topology of all vehicles, regardless of leader or member. Then, a class of robust control is proposed to render each vehicle to follow its prescribed constraint. The control is designed based on third-order nonlinear vehicle dynamics. The uniform boundedness, uniform ultimate boundedness performance of the entire system and string stability of LVP have been proven by leveraging the Lyapunov stability theory. The simulation results confirm that the proposed method functions well under time-varying traffic volume. Furthermore, the proposed method significantly improves the fuel economy, driving comfort and safety under low traffic volume compared with baseline methods.}

However, the use of fossil-fueled vehicles for this repositioning task generates pollutants and greenhouse gases, which harm the environment. The use of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) instead of fossil-fueled vehicles for repositioning bikes can mitigate this negative environmental impact. On the other hand, user demand for bikes is dynamic during the daytime. Therefore, this study addresses the dynamic BRP with battery electric vehicles. Multiple charging technologies are available at charging stations to allow repositioning vehicles to recharge en-route at different speeds and costs. The objective is to solve the problem by minimizing the weighted sum of the penalty costs of unmet user demand and the charging costs of repositioning vehicles. A rolling horizon framework is adopted to incorporate the revealed inventory levels at bike stations, the BEV load of bikes, and the battery energy levels of BEVs at regular intervals. An artificial bee colony algorithm with an embedded dynamic programming method for computing the loading instructions is proposed to generate solutions. Computational experiments are conducted on a real-world BSS, and three aspects of the problem properties are analyzed: the horizon settings, the various penalties for failed rentals and returns, and the charging-related settings. The results provide practical insights into the use of BEVs for daily bike-repositioning tasks in BSSs.}

However, no consensus has been reached yet about the size and direction of the effect of AVs on VTTS. This high uncertainty around the VTTS is most likely due to high heterogeneity in preferences for travel time. Our hypothesis is that a key role in the heterogeneity of the VTTS for AVs is played by psychological factors. We focus in particular on Travel Experiences (besides individual preference for activities conducted during travelling) and Trust in travel time preferences for AVs. For this purpose, an online survey with a stated choice experiment and psychometric scales was conducted. Besides currently available transport modes, also a privately-owned AV (PAV) and a shared AV (SAV) were included in the choice sets. The data was analysed using a hybrid choice model. T-test and confidence intervals of the estimated VTTS are computed to assess if the VTTS are statistically significant and statistically different among user groups. Results confirm that both psychological factors have significant positive effect on VTTS for AVs. Gender, age, level of education and experience with similar systems were found to affect the VTTS directly and indirectly through their impact on the individual attitudes. Significant differences are found among some potential user groups, in particular in terms of trust to technology and anticipated travel experiences. For example, men are found to trust the technology more than women and also to have potentially higher technology affinity. However, our results show that they also perceive higher marginal disutility for travel time in both PAV and SAV. A comparison between a mixed logit model and the hybrid choice model reveals that capturing the indirect effect of the socio-economic characteristics of individuals through the effect of these factors on attitudes allows differentiating between the VTTS for different user groups. Lastly, implications for policy and technology deployment strategies are discussed based on the findings.}

abstract = {This paper develops a novel household-oriented activity-based mixed-equilibrium model for estimating individual and household activity–travel choices in multimodal transportation networks with interactions between private car and public transit modes. In the novel model, household members with heterogeneous errors of perception on the time-dependent utility of different activity types make daily joint/solo activity–travel choices in a mixed-equilibrium manner, which maximizes either perceived household utility or perceived individual utility. A logit-based stochastic choice model is developed to capture the mixed equilibrium with heterogeneous errors of perception and used to predict the choices of alternative joint activity–travel paths (JATPs) on a supernetwork platform. Based on this stochastic JATP choice model, the mixed-equilibrium model is formulated as an equivalent variational inequality (VI) problem and solved using a modified diagonalization method. This converts the time-dependent activity–travel scheduling problem into an equivalent static traffic assignment problem on JATPs. The conditions required for the existence and uniqueness of a solution to the equivalent VI problem in terms of a JATP flow pattern are also identified. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the model’s merits and its applications for examining the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.}

abstract = {In recent times, hurricanes Matthew, Harvey, and Irma have disrupted the lives of millions of people across multiple states in the United States. Under hurricane evacuation, efficient traffic operations can maximize the use of transportation infrastructure, reducing evacuation time and stress due to massive congestion. Evacuation traffic prediction is critical to plan for effective traffic management strategies. However, due to the complex and dynamic nature of evacuation participation, predicting evacuation traffic demand long ahead of the actual evacuation is a very challenging task. Real-time information from various sources can significantly help us reliably predict evacuation demand. In this study, we use traffic sensor and Twitter data during hurricanes Matthew and Irma to predict traffic demand during evacuation for a longer forecasting horizon (greater than 1 h). We present a machine learning approach using Long-Short Term Memory Neural Networks (LSTM-NN), trained over real-world traffic data during hurricane evacuation (hurricanes Irma and Matthew) using different combinations of input features and forecast horizons. We compare our prediction results against a baseline prediction and existing machine learning models. Results show that the proposed model can predict traffic demand during evacuation well up to 24 h ahead. The proposed LSTM-NN model can significantly benefit future evacuation traffic management.}

This paper develops a methodological framework to explore typical travel patterns from multi-density high dimensional matrices and estimate typical OD corresponding to those patterns. The contributions of the paper are multi-fold. First, to cluster high-dimensional OD matrices, we deploy geographical window-based structural similarity index (GSSI) as proximity measure in the DBSCAN algorithm that captures both OD structure and network related attributes. Second, to address the issue of multi-density data points, we propose clustering on individual subspaces. Third, we develop a simple two-level approach to identify optimum DBSCAN parameters. Finally, as proof-of-concept, the proposed framework is applied on proxy OD matrices from real Bluetooth data (B-OD) from Brisbane City Council region. The OD matrix clusters, typical travel patterns, and typical B-OD matrices are estimated for this study region. The analysis reveals nine typical travel patterns. The methodology was also found to perform better when GSSI was used instead of Euclidian distance as a proximity measure, and two-level DBSCAN instead of K-medoids, Spectral, and Hierarchical methods. The framework is generic and applicable for OD matrices developed from other data sources and any spatiotemporal context. DBSCAN is chosen for this study because it does not require a pre-determined number of clusters, and it identifies outliers as noise.}

Deep learning technologies have been widely used to infer the hidden features of passively collected mobile data. A deep neural network, however, is so deterministic that the probabilistic aspect of activity inference cannot be accommodated. In the present study, a stochastic approach (VAE-HMM) was devised to generate human activity chains by incorporating a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a hidden Markov model (HMM). Whereas an original HMM clusters data in the observational space, the proposed approach conducts clustering in a latent space with a smaller dimension. The VAE contributes by both reducing the input dimensionality and by sidestepping the overfit to sample data. The variational inference (VI) method was used to estimate the parameters of VAE-HMM within a Bayesian framework. Data drawn from spatio-temporal, demographic, socio-economic, and individual-specific sources were chosen as input variables to feed the model. The VAE-HMM can be trained in either a supervised or an unsupervised manner.}

Although the topic has been discussed extensively by many researchers and experts, it is beneficial to complement current studies by explaining the AV-related sentiment variations leveraging the unique social media features. Different from traditional survey-based studies, this study relies on tweets to understand the sentiments on AVs. A comprehensive model framework is proposed to categorize sentiments, recognize critical dates with sentiment changes, and explain sentiment variations. The results indicate that the general sentiment is positive towards AVs, but social media users have sentiment biases towards different AV terms. Significant sentiment changes are often linked with major social events related to AVs, and the general public is more sensitive to social events than the most active users. A wide range of policy insights are discussed based on the results of the analyses, including policies related to safety, pricing, unemployment, and AV adoption rate. Possible challenges and the corresponding strategies are also discussed. These insights will be helpful for the public agencies, automobile manufacturers, and technology companies in gaining a better understanding of AV adoption, and in preparing for the future of transportation systems.}

Previous studies on the effect of disruptions on passenger travel behaviour have mainly focused on shorter disruptions, while the few studies on impacts of long-term disruptions have had limited focus on individual passenger behaviour. This paper fills the gap in research by proposing a novel methodology based on smart card data for analysing the impacts of long-term planned disruptions on passenger travel behaviour. We use k-means clustering to group passengers based on their travel behaviour before and after the closure. We can thus observe how different passenger groups changed travel behaviour after the disruption. We compare these observations to a group of reference lines without disruption to account for general trends. Using hierarchical clustering of daily travel patterns, we are able to in-depth analyse the reactions of certain passenger groups to the disruption. We apply the method on a 3-month closure of a rail line in the Greater Copenhagen area. The results suggest that, in particular, passengers with an everyday commuting behaviour have decreased after the disruption. The proposed methodology enables explicit analysis of the impact of disruptions on diverse passengers segments, while the specific results are useful for public transport agencies when planning long-term maintenance projects.}

abstract = {This paper presents a methodology for developing demand-responsive passenger flow control strategies for oversaturated metro networks. A stated preference-off-revealed preference survey was conducted to capture passengers’ behavioural responses to the passenger flow control strategies, and revealed significant behavioural change intentions in terms of departure times and mode choices. Currently, such behavioural responses are often ignored, leading to deviations in estimating the size of a target group and performance of a proposed strategy. To address this issue, in this study, a mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) approach was developed to optimise demand-responsive passenger flow control strategies. The proposed MPEC model highlights the importance of balancing the operational efficiency of a metro system with service fairness perceived by passengers. In particular, a nested logit-based stochastic user equilibrium problem was included to accommodate potential changes in demand patterns driven by candidate passenger flow control strategies. Two empirical cases based on the Guangzhou and Beijing metros were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution algorithm. The results show that the inclusion of service fairness considerations does not contradict the pursuit of efficiency. Instead, dual emphases on service fairness and passengers’ behavioural responses help create a win–win situation for both metro operators and passengers. In the Guangzhou and Beijing metros, the highest section load rate decreased from 126.6\% to 105.7\% and from 122.98\% to 106.87\%, respectively, under the optimal passenger flow control strategies. The corresponding network load Gini coefficients improved from 0.278 to 0.259 and from 0.269 to 0.248, demonstrating the remarkable performance of this approach in regards to peak cutting and load balancing.}

We formulate an optimization problem that includes vehicle dynamics and collision-avoidance constraints with explicit representation of vehicle paths. The objective function of the problem minimizes the distance of CAVs to their destinations and their acceleration magnitudes. The methodology also involves a customized solution technique that convexifies the collision-avoidance constraints and employs the alternating direction method of multipliers to decompose the convexified problem into two sub-problems. The first sub-problem only includes vehicle dynamics constraints while the second sub-problem projects the solutions of the first sub-problem onto a collision-free region. The first sub-problem is then transformed into a quadratic problem by redefining its decision variables along vehicle paths. The transformation allows solving this sub-problem with several vehicle-level problems in a distributed architecture. Moreover, we show that iterating between the two sub-problems leads to convergence to the optimal solutions of the convexified problem. The methodology is applied to a case study roundabout with different demand levels. The results show that the trajectory optimization reduced the total travel times and average delays respectively by 9.1\% to 36.8\% and 95.8\% to 98.5\% compared to a scenario with human-driven vehicles.}

We classify airport performance with recurrent and convolutional neural networks considering weather data. We are using London–Gatwick Airport to apply our developed approach. The weather data is derived from local meteorological reports and airport performance is derived from both flight plan data and reported delays. We show that the application of machine learning approaches is an appropriate method to quantify the correlation between decreased airport performance and the severity of local weather events. The developed models could achieve prediction accuracy higher than 90\% for departure movements. We see our approach as one key element for a deeper understanding of interdependencies between local and network operations in the air transportation system.}

Yet, metropolitan regions are typically characterized by complex and dense terminal airspace structure that accommodates arrival and departure traffic from large metroplex airports. Therefore, UAM operations are expected to be initially integrated into urban airspace without interfering with conventional operations and compromising current safety and efficiency levels. This paper presents a data-driven approach to identify and predict available urban airspace that is procedurally separated from conventional air traffic towards supporting UAM integration. We use historical aircraft tracking and meteorological data to learn the spatial distribution of air traffic in the terminal airspace and create a probabilistic traffic model to predict active traffic patterns and their spatial confidence regions given current operational conditions. We demonstrate the approach for the city of Sao Paulo and its closest commercial airport, Congonhas (CGH), in Brazil. The results show that leveraging the traffic flow dynamics to allocate the urban airspace dynamically is beneficial to increase UAM accessibility by more than 5\% from 3000 ft. Moreover, airspace availability is found to be highly sensitive to the applied separation requirements, emphasizing the importance of leveraging advanced technologies to progressively make such requirements less stringent.}

However, most existing studies on flight delay modeling do not consider en-route congestion explicitly. In this study, we propose a new flight delay model, Multi-layer Air Traffic Network Delay (MATND) model, to capture the impact of en-route congestion on flight delays over an air traffic network. This model is developed by a data-driven approach, taking aircraft tracking data and flight schedules as inputs to characterize a national air traffic network, as well as a system-level model approach, modeling the delay process based on queueing theory. The two approaches combined make the network delay model a close representation of reality and easy-to-implement for what-if scenario analysis. The proposed MATND model includes 1) a data-driven method to learn a network composed of airports, en-route congestion points, and air corridors from aircraft tracking data, 2) a stochastic and dynamic queuing network model to calculate flight delays and track their propagation at both airports and in en-route congestion areas, in which the delays are computed via a space–time decomposition method. Using one month of historical aircraft tracking data over China’s air traffic network, MATND is tested and shows to give an accurate quantification of delays of the national air traffic network. “What-if” scenario analyses are conducted to demonstrate how the proposed model can be used for the evaluation of air traffic network improvement strategies, where the manipulation of reality at such a scale is impossible. Results show that MATND is computationally efficient, well suited for evaluating the impact of policy alternatives on system-wide delay at a macroscopic level.}

Most existing studies focus on demand forecasting for a single mode, while much less attention has been paid to multimodal demand forecasting. This paper develops a multimodal demand forecasting approach, which can learn and utilize information/knowledge from different public transit modes and thus improve the demand prediction of the travel mode with sparse observations (e.g., station-sparse mode). In particular, this study focuses on improving the passenger demand prediction accuracy of the station-sparse mode(s) with the help of the station-intensive mode (i.e., the mode with more sufficient knowledge and intensive station distribution over space). We propose a novel Knowledge Adaptation with Attentive Multi-task Memory Network (KA2M2) in order to utilize closely-related demand patterns from the station-intensive mode for demand forecasting of the station-sparse mode(s). Specifically, we first design a memory-augmented recurrent network for enhancing the ability to capture the long-and-short term demand information and storing the extracted temporal knowledge of each transit mode. Then, we develop and integrate an attention-based knowledge adaptation module to adapt relevant information from the station-intensive source to the station-sparse source(s). The experimental results on a real-world dataset collected from the Greater Sydney area covering four public transport modes (bus, train, light rail, and ferry) demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms a number of baseline methods and state-of-the-art models. Our findings also illustrate that incorporating information/knowledge from multimodal trip records can enhance the demand forecasting accuracy for station-sparse modes.}

Particularly, ride-hailing has experienced a worldwide boom in the last decade since it provides a convenient, on-demand door-to-door service for urban trips. In parallel, an increasing number of studies have been conducted, mainly analyzing individuals’ behavior towards this transport option, mobility patterns, as well as ride-hailing effects on urban sustainability. Nevertheless, the majority of these contributions focus on US cities, while almost no efforts have been devoted to other geographic areas, such as Europe. Cities in this continent present some particular characteristics that make them a case worth investigating, such as a higher presence of public transport modes or a great public concern on environmental issues. The aim of this paper is to explore travel behavior towards ride-hailing services in a European city. Based on the information collected from a survey campaign in the city of Madrid (Spain), we estimate a Generalized Heterogeneous Data Model approach to identify the key factors motivating ride-hailing adoption and frequency of use. The paper identifies a higher adoption of ride-hailing services among young, well-educated, wealthy individuals, who are familiar with new technologies. More interestingly, the research suggests a noticeable role played by environmental consciousness in ride-hailing frequency of use, compared to US cities. Particularly, individuals with lower environmental consciousness are more car-oriented, which is also linked to a more intense use of ride-hailing. By contrast, individuals with a higher environmental consciousness tend to reduce their use of ride-hailing, which reflects their propensity towards public transport in a transit-intensive background.}

We consider two objectives: (i) to minimize the total discounted cost for the main stakeholders, represented by the agency and users; and (ii) to minimize the discounted user costs under a limited agency budget. Inspection technology innovations have enabled us to investigate the conditions of a group of multiple roadway facilities almost simultaneously, using instrumented vehicles that can travel at the same speed as traffic. Previous related studies have primarily focused on, at most, a bi-level structure with all the managerial activities, such as inspection and MR&R at the facility level and the allocation of a pooled budget at the system level. However, this cannot reflect the current group-level inspection practice, positioned between the facility and system levels. The proposed methodology adopts a bottom-up approach to account for heterogeneous facility- and group-specific properties, and it optimally facilitates determination of the multi-scale decisions to minimize the discounted societal costs. We address the complex multi-scale problem efficiently by adopting the Markov Decision Process, function approximation, and Lagrangian relaxation. As a numerical study, we analyze a real-world roadway network, including three expressway groups and one local road group, near Daejeon City in Korea. The system-level optimal solutions for the multi-scale decisions are determined, and the impacts of the grouping method are investigated.}

Based on multiple heterogeneous data sources, which include aggregated mobility change reports and household survey data, this paper proposes a machine learning approach for dynamic activity chain pattern estimation with improved interpretability for examining behavioral pattern adjustments. Based on historical household survey samples, we first establish a computational graph-based discrete choice model to estimate the baseline travel tour parameters before the pandemic. To further capture structural deviations of activity chain patterns from day-by-day time series, we define the activity-oriented deviation parameters within an interpretable utility-based nested logit model framework, which are further estimated through a constrained optimization problem. By incorporating the long short-term memory method as the explainable module to capture the complex periodic and trend information before and after interventions, we predict day-to-day activity chain patterns with more accuracy. The performance of our model is examined based on publicly available datasets such as the 2017 National Household Travel Survey in the United States and the Google Global Mobility Dataset throughout the epidemic period. Our model could shed more light on transportation planning, policy adaptation and management decisions during the pandemic and post-pandemic phases.}

abstract = {Routing controllability of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) has been shown to reduce the adverse effects of selfish routing on the network efficiency. However, the assumption that CAV owners would readily allow themselves to be controlled externally by a central agency for the good of the system is unrealistic. In this paper, we propose a joint routing and pricing control scheme that aims to incentivize CAVs to seek centrally controlled system-optimal (SO) routing by saving on tolls while user equilibrium (UE) seeking human-driven vehicles (HVs) are subject to a congestion charge. The problem is formulated as a bi-level optimization program where the upper level optimizes the dynamic toll rates using the network fundamental diagram (NFD) and the lower level is a mixed equilibrium simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment model (SBDTA) considering different combinations of SO-seeking CAVs. We apply a feedback-based controller to solve for the optimal spatially differentiated distance-based congestion charge from which SO-seeking CAVs are exempt; but UE-seeking HVs are subject to the charge for entering the city center. To capture the distinct microscopic behavior of CAVs in the mixed autonomy traffic, we also implement an adaptive link fundamental diagram (FD) within the SBDTA model. The proposed joint control scheme encourages CAV owners to seek SO routing resulting in less total system travel time. It also discourages UE-seeking HVs from congesting the city center. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme in both a small network and a large-scale network of Melbourne, Australia.}

abstract = {As demands for convenient and comfortable mobility grow, transportation network companies (TNCs) begin to diversify the ride-hailing services they offer. Modes that are offered now include ride-pooling (RP), non-ride-pooling (NP), and a third “bundled” option, which combines RP and NP. This emerging bundled option allows riders to be served via either RP or NP mode, whichever becomes available first. This paper examines the added complexity that a ride-hailing service platform faces when it introduces a third bundled option. Incorporating the predicted pooling information in the near future, a ride-matching problem is dedicated to matching vehicles with riders under various scenarios over a number of matching iterations. We formulate the multi-period ride-matching problem using an integer linear programming model with multiple objectives and to make dispatching decisions based on certain matching criteria. The complexity of the problem requires resolution via a two-stage Kuhn-Munkres (2-KM) algorithm, whose robustness is verified by computational tests. Some interesting insights are obtained: (1) how the bundled option impacts system performance metrics depends on whether the supply is sufficient or not; (2) there is an optimal value of the criterion of the maximum pickup time that maximizes the ride-pooling time savings.}

The current work investigates the effect of multi-modal interactions at space-mean network speed for each mode using the dataset from pNEUMA experiment that was carried out in a congested city centre network of Athens, Greece. Explanatory variables considered are the accumulation and the stopped fraction of vehicles of each mode. Firstly, a multi-modal mean speed MFD is considered by assuming that the mean speed of each mode can be expressed in terms of accumulations of all modes. The quality of multi-modal MFD fits is compared to the uni-modal ones, where the mean speed of a given mode is assumed to be a function of the accumulation of that mode only. Secondly, the classical two-fluid model is extended to multi-modal networks. An analysis on the ergodicity assumption in the context of stopped fraction is also presented. This work also introduces a network-level dynamic model that uses the stopped fraction of vehicles. This so-called extended trip-based model simulates the stop-and-go pattern of the vehicles thereby reproducing the evolution of network congestion. This work is the first to explore in this direction. The results from the classical trip-based and the extended trip-based models are compared and validated with the empirical data.}

abstract = {The demand on the public transportation in many cities has been increasing with the diversity of commuters’ activities that require the regular travelling across the urban and suburb areas. However, the public transport systems still suffer from the traffic congestion and detour, which will then reduce the efficiency. Accordingly, extensive efforts have been made for decades to optimize the operations of metro ground traffic with trains, subways, and buses (2D public transportation). On the other hand, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely applied in the event-triggered tasks, such as delivery, rescue and surveillance in urban environments, and they have a great potential to relieve the pressure in 2D ground public transportation. Inspired from metro systems, AirMetro is a new concept proposed for future 3D public air transportation service, which carries the passengers commuting from a point to the destination, routinely and periodically. In this paper, the flight scheduling problem for AirMetro is studied based on the flight route of UAVs. The low-altitude airspace in urban environments is divided into several layers by altitude, and AirMetro is conducted in the allocated airspace as the public lanes. First, a pipeline-based route planning algorithm is proposed for the gridded urban environments to further reduce the length of a flight route generated by A* algorithm. The UAV is not required to pass through the centre of a cube in the pipeline-based algorithm when compared with the A* algorithm. This can then potentially result in a shorter flight route. As for resolving the conflict among UAVs, a minimum influence-based approach is developed to delay the flight and reduce the influence of adjustment on the follow-up flights of the UAV. By further introducing a modified simulated annealing (MSA) algorithm, the delay of flight can be further reduced by optimizing the UAV sequence conducting the conflict resolution. Results of the case studies demonstrate that the trajectory-based flight scheduling method can improve the flight efficiency by ensuring the flight safety of UAVs and reducing the average delay of UAVs as well in AirMetro.}

abstract = {As air traffic demand grows, robust, data-driven methods are required to ensure that aviation systems become safer and more efficient. The terminal airspace is identified as the most critical airspace for both individual flight-level and system-level safety and efficiency. As such, developing data-driven anomaly detection methods to analyze terminal airspace operations has been an active area of research. With the expansion of ADS-B technology, open-source flight tracking data has become more readily available to enable larger-scale analyses of aircraft operations. Generally, the methods developed to detect anomalies in ADS-B trajectory data detect anomalies in either the spatial or energy dimension. These methods distinctly use either spatial metrics or energy metrics, derived from ADS-B trajectory data. Motivated by the limited number of approaches that simultaneously consider both spatial and energy metrics, this paper introduces the concepts of spatial anomalies and energy anomalies and performs a novel investigation into the relationships and interdependencies, if any exist, between the two types of anomalies. To enable this analysis, spatial and energy anomalies are detected in ADS-B trajectory data (and associated derived metrics) using HDBSAN and DBSCAN clustering algorithms, respectively. Four months of ADS-B trajectory data associated with arrivals at San Francisco International Airport is extracted, cleaned and processed. The results that stem from this investigation indicate that if an aircraft is not spatially conforming to an identified set of air traffic flows representing standard spatial operations, then this aircraft is more likely to experience non-conformance to standard operations in its energy metrics. Additionally, this research reveals underlying differences between trajectories that are spatially nominal and energy-anomalous and those trajectories that are spatially anomalous and energy-anomalous. Focusing solely on energy anomalies does not provide insight into potential spatial-related decisions that may have been made to result in off-nominal energy behavior.}

However, the extent to which network-level macroscopic traffic models may be ready for practical implementation remains to be ascertained. This paper aims to shed light on this matter by reviewing the 50-year history of macroscopic modeling of urban networks and assessing remaining gaps and opportunities for further development of both theory and applications. To this end, the existing literature’s chronology is mapped onto three eras of development, and the corresponding theories, assumptions, and limitations are outlined and discussed in two streams, equilibrium relations and traffic dynamics. Among the topics pertaining to equilibrium relations, the highlighted gaps include the lack of empirical studies on the hysteresis and bifurcation phenomena, the existence of multi-modal NMFD (3D-NMFD) in different traffic conditions, the factors that might affect the (3D-) NMFD shape, the accuracy of speed-NMFDs in particular different bus speed NMFDs, and the passenger-oriented NMFDs. Research gaps pertaining to traffic dynamics include the analytical solution of trip-based models, the FIFO violation in the delay-based models, the definition of outflow and entrance functions, the notion of active network length, the trip length distribution, and the path flow distribution. Future research directions targeting topics that might shape the potential next era include the practical implementation of NMFD-based control strategies, the application of NMFD in quality of service assessments, and NMFD in the presence of new technologies such as connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs).}

The majority of existing automated fleet management systems focus on central dispatch strategies that rely on real-time information and communication. This paper proposes a novel decentralised cooperative cruising method for offline operation of a-taxi fleets, which serves as a contingency plan during a full communication shutdown. The proposed method acts as an emergency plan for the system to continue serving passengers with the objective of maximising the total number of served passengers by the fleet. The method uses historical trip data to estimate PageRank centralities of roads as a proxy of long-term likelihood of finding waiting passengers over a series of trips. The proposed method uses this metric to (i) compute weighted shortest paths for vacant a-taxi cruising route planning, and (ii) partition the network into homogeneous regions for effective cruising destination choice (mission planning). The movements of vacant a-taxis between regions are modelled as a Markov chain such that a transition probability matrix is computed to achieve the optimal spatial distribution of vacant a-taxis to maximise the total expected pick-ups by the fleet, estimated based on bilateral meeting functions. Compared to benchmark strategies which select destinations randomly and cruise along the shortest travel time path, the proposed method shows significant improvements in service performances for different fleet sizes.}

Given that most distractions may have a direct influence on drivers’ control of vehicles, this paper proposes a new method to utilize available vehicle kinematic data for detecting distracted driving. The proposed method predicts vehicle kinematics by fusing multiple state–space models that capture different driving motion patterns under normal driving. An online monitoring scheme is developed by using Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) and Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) charts, which detects abnormal mean shifts of lateral speeds and prediction errors of lane positions to provide warnings of distracted driving. A case study is presented based on two naturalistic driving datasets — the Integrated Vehicle-Based Safety Systems (IVBSS) and Safety Pilot Model Deployment (SPMD) datasets.}

The demand for safe and efficient mobility of people and goods is growing rapidly, in line with the growth in population in US urban centers. In response, new technologies to meet these urban mobility demands are also rapidly maturing in preparation for future full-scale deployment. As surface congestion increases and the technology surrounding unmanned aerial systems (UAS) matures, more people are looking to the urban airspace and Urban Air Mobility (UAM) as a piece of the puzzle to promote mobility in cities. However, the lack of coordination between UAS stakeholders, federal UAS safety regulations, and researchers developing UAS algorithms continues to be a critical barrier to widespread UAS adoption. FADS takes into account federal UAS safety requirements, UAM challenge scenarios, contingency events, as well as stakeholder-specific operational requirements. FADS formalizes these requirements, through Signal Temporal Logic (STL) representations, and a trajectory planning optimization for multi-rotor UAS fleets guarantees robust and continuous-time satisfaction of the requirements and mission objectives. The intuitive FADS user interface makes it easy to plan missions in a variety of environments; we demonstrate this through several rural and urban environment-based case studies. FADS holistically integrates high-level stakeholder objectives with low-level trajectory planning; combined with a user-friendly interface, FADS reduces the complexity of stakeholder coordination within the UAM context.}

Such customer-searching movements, while not being directly controlled by ride-sourcing platforms, impose great impacts on the service efficiency of ride-sourcing systems and thus need to be better understood. To this purpose, we design a dynamic discrete choice framework by modeling drivers’ customer search as absorbing Markov decision processes. The model enables us to differentiate three latent search movements of idle drivers, as they either remain motionless, cruise around without a target area, or reposition toward specific destinations. Our calibration takes advantage of large-scale empirical datasets from Didi Chuxing, including the transaction information of five million passenger requests and the trajectories of 32,000 affiliated drivers. The calibration results uncover the variations of drivers’ attitudes in customer search across time and space. In general, ride-sourcing drivers do respond actively and positively to the repetitive market variations when idle. They are comparatively more mobile at high-demand hotspots while preferring to stay motionless in areas with long time of waiting being expected. Our results also suggest that drivers’ search movements are not confined to local considerations. Instead, idle drivers show a clear tendency of repositioning toward the faraway hotspots, especially during the evening when the demand cools down in the suburb. The discrepancies between full-time and part-time drivers’ search behavior are also examined quantitatively.}

This paper proposes an origin–destination (OD) competitive network equilibrium model for RSM with heterogeneous TNCs. A finite-dimensional variational inequality is adopted to formulate the RSM competitive network equilibrium model based on the non-cooperative game theory. It assumes that each TNC and individual drivers aim to maximize profits or earnings, while passengers of demand regions seek utility maximization. The monotonicity of equilibrium optima is analytically derived, and the sensitivity analysis of parameters is theoretically conducted and numerically illustrated. The managerial insights are gained both for the government and TNCs. The analytical findings include: (a) market equilibrium price increases and market equilibrium travel quantity decreases in either the transaction cost, driver cost, or TNC cost; (b) market equilibrium price decreases in the number of light-asset TNCs, while the market equilibrium travel quantity increases in it; and (c) raising RSM entry requirements improves the market equilibrium price and reduces travel demand on RSM. The numerical results illustrate the plausibility and flexibility of the analytical model. The proposed model is general and capable of analyzing the network equilibrium with multi-type drivers, demand regions, and heterogeneous ride-sourcing platforms.}

These schemes allow more efficient deployment of resources at the expense of introducing more complexity into the system operation. This study aims to determine the effect of the branched layout of a corridor, demand distribution and traffic lights on the total cost of the system as well as its service regularity. The transit corridor is operated by buses, although it can be generalized for other transit modes. An operational model to estimate the travel and waiting time of users and the performance of buses on each route segment is developed. The model considers the stochastic effect of the passenger arrivals at stops and vehicle acceleration–deceleration rates. An optimization procedure to determine the optimal headway and relative synchronization of routes, which minimizes the total cost incurred by transit agencies and users or the headway variations in the common route segment, is introduced. Furthermore, a performance evaluation of bus control strategies based on a combination of holding points and green extensions at traffic signals in the H10 cross-town corridor of Barcelona’s new bus network is presented.}

abstract = {Dynamic network loading (DNL) is a core part of simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) models, which describes how traffic propagates on a transportation network and usually maps a set of route departure rates to a set of route travel times. Due to the incorporation of different intra- and inter-link dynamics such as queuing, spillback, etc., DNL becomes complex, resulting in models with undesirable analytical properties (e.g., discontinuity, non-differentiability, and lack of closed-form) and requiring intensive computational efforts. Moreover, as DNL is applied repeatedly in simulation-based DTA algorithms, it often is the computational bottleneck of large-scale traffic assignment and related optimization problems. In this research, we address these problems by proposing a link-to-link segment-based Kriging metamodel for dynamic network loading. The proposed Kriging model calculates route travel time, link travel time, and link flow. It systematically approximates the traditional DNL model while being faster and maintaining some desirable analytical properties. Both temporal and spatial proximity information and the route segment incidence information are incorporated in the metamodel formulation. The models are trained using maximum likelihood estimation with different dataset sizes. In the experiments, the proposed Kriging metamodels performed better than a state-of-the-art neural network model, achieving an average error of 1.64\% and 5.32\% in the Nguyen Dupuis (ND) network and the Sioux Falls (SF) network, respectively, along with at least 43 times, sometimes as high as over 1300 times, improvement in computational speed. The results, however, suggest a tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy and the size of the training dataset. With balanced route demand, the model’s performance was reasonable even under congested traffic conditions. The MAPE values were at most 3\% and 18\% in the ND network and the SF network, respectively, for different level of congestion demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model.}

abstract = {Providing a railway transit system (RTS) in less populated areas is a challenging task for transportation agencies due to its high construction and operating costs. With the advent of automation, shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) as an integral part of public transit services has the potential to enhance the design of transit systems. In this paper, we present a joint optimization framework of railway transit network design and SAV first-mile service that minimizes the total cost of the combined RTS-SAV services and commuters’ waiting time, while serving a dynamic travel demand in the network. The proposed model optimizes the SAV fleet size and the RTS alignment while enabling vehicle relocations to tackle the vehicle imbalance issue in the SAV service. Due to the non-linear and mixed-integer formulation, we develop a fixed-point algorithm for this joint RTS-SAV problem where we transform the original problem into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation. Our results indicate that the joint RTS-SAV services can be constructed and operated at a lower cost than either of the RTS or SAV services alone. Furthermore, the resulting joint RTS-SAV services are underpinned by a shorter railway alignment and larger fleet size rather than a multi-link extension. Additionally, the joint RTS-SAV services is robust to the variation in total demand, with respect to the railway alignment, SAV utilization and commuters’ waiting time.}

abstract = {Car-following behavior has been extensively studied using physics-based models, such as Intelligent Driving Model (IDM). These models successfully interpret traffic phenomena observed in the real world but may not fully capture the complex cognitive process of driving. Deep learning models, on the other hand, have demonstrated their power in capturing observed traffic phenomena but require a large amount of driving data to train. This paper aims to develop a family of neural network based car-following models that are informed by physics-based models, which leverage the advantage of both physics-based (being data-efficient and interpretable) and deep learning based (being generalizable) models. We design physics-informed deep learning car-following model (PIDL-CF) architectures encoded with 4 popular physics-based models - the IDM, the Optimal Velocity Model, the Gazis-Herman-Rothery model, and the Full Velocity Difference Model. Acceleration is predicted for 4 traffic regimes: acceleration, deceleration, cruising, and emergency braking. The generalization of PIDL method is further validated using two representative neural network models: the artificial neural networks (ANN) and the long short-term memory (LSTM) model. Two types of PIDL-CF problems are studied, one to predict acceleration only and the other to jointly predict acceleration and discover model parameters. We also demonstrate the superior performance of PIDL with the Next Generation SIMulation (NGSIM) dataset over baselines, especially when the training data is sparse. The results demonstrate the superior performance of neural networks informed by physics over those without.}

Decision-making about revamping service deployments must become more rapid and accurate to achieve optimal, cost-efficient go-to-market networks for service routing with appropriate slot allocation. Traditional decision-making models focus on routing selection, fleet management, and container repositioning without considering changes in trading demand patterns, port performance, and trade lane yields. Here, a trade- and port-performance model for predicting shipping network yields was developed for revamp service deployment analyses, with optimised sets of allocated spaces on selected port calls at the service and shipment levels. Optimisation algorithms based on the branch-and-bound, genetic algorithm, and deep neural network techniques were developed for this model and applied to revamp services in Intra-Asia trade with consideration of the impact of the US–China trade war. The developed model assists trade pricing, network planning, yield management, and slot allocation in ship liner operations. Decision support models of shipping networks that enable ship liners to collaborate by forming alliances in service deployment can be explored as a further development.}

abstract = {This paper proposes an innovative framework of predicting driver behavior under varying dilemma zone conditions using artificial intelligence-based machine learning. The framework utilizes multiple machine learning techniques to process vehicle attribute data (e.g., speed, location, and time-of-arrival) collected at the onset of the yellow indication, and eventually predicts drivers’ stop-or-go decision based on the data. A linear SVM was used to extract through vehicles from all approaching vehicles detected from radar sensors. A hierarchical clustering method was utilized to classify different traffic patterns by time-of-day. Finally, driver behavior prediction models were developed using three machine learning techniques (i.e., linear SVM, polynomial SVM, and ANN) widely adopted for binary classification problems. Model validation results showed that all the prediction models perform well with high prediction accuracies. The ANN model, which showed the best performance among the three, was selected to represent dilemma zone boundaries. Results show that the dilemma zone start- and end-points would both locate further from the stop bar with higher approaching speeds. Furthermore, the dilemma zone end-point would be more sensitive to the approaching speed than the start-point is. As a result, the dilemma zone length would become longer with higher approaching speeds. Results also showed that the dilemma zone length and location would vary by time-of-day regardless of the speed of approaching vehicles. The analysis showed that the dilemma zone length would be longer and its location would be much further from the stop bar for vehicles arriving during rush hours, as compared to those arriving during non-rush or nighttime hours. This indicates that drivers’ decision location to stop or go (when they are faced with a dilemma zone situation) is distributed farther from the intersection stop bar during rush hours. The proposed method shows an effective way of predicting driver behavior on signalized intersections. It is expected for the transportation agencies to use the method to improve intersection signal operations more effectively and safely.}

This paper studies this new problem and proposes three different order-consolidation strategies for service operators. Our numerical results show that order consolidation, particularly shopping consolidation, can significantly increase the number of served orders by better using the available shopper capacity. We observe that splitting orders can further enhance the performance of the system. The results also suggest that personal shopper services increase time utilization and execute shopping activities using significantly less human resources than customers shopping for themselves.}

We explore the energy savings when following city and highway drive cycles, as well as in emergent highway traffic created from microsimulations. Model predictive control handles high level velocity planning and benefits from communicated intentions of a preceding CAV or estimated probable motion of a preceding human driven vehicle. A combination of classical feedback control and data-driven nonlinear feedforward control of pedals achieve acceleration tracking at the low level.

abstract = {Most congested urban arterials, connecting multiple major intersections with heavy turning flows, are likely to comprise multiple high-volume path flows in addition to its through traffic. Hence, such arterials, if designed with state-of-the-art models for progressing mainly through traffic flows, cannot achieve the expected level of performance, because those heavy path flows involving turning movements will inevitably suffer from overflows at their turning bays and consequently trigger a mutual blockage between the turning and through traffic flows. Although some recent advances on multi-path signal progression (Yang et al., 2015; Arsava et al., 2016) offer a viable design alternative for arterials accommodating such traffic patterns, their required data such as the arterial’s O-Ds or path volume information cannot be collected with state-of-the-practice traffic sensors, or mathematically estimated at the accuracy level sufficient for design of control strategies. As such, this study proposes a model with the optimized phase sequence and offsets to produce a progression band for each candidate path along the target arterial with only each intersection's volume counts, based on the set of “local bands” for all local paths constituted by each link’s upstream flow-in and downstream flow-out movements. Such identified local progression bands are then optimally connected between two neighboring links to form the progression band for traffic flows on each path to progress over multiple arterial links under the objective of maximizing the total weighted progression bands. To ensure the effectiveness of the produced progression bands, the proposed model has accounted for all factors and geometric constraints that may cause their mutual impedance in design of the offsets and phase sequences. The results of extensive numerical experiments with respect to delay and the number of stops per vehicle (reduced by 5.8\% and 9.9\%, respectively, compared to the benchmark model) within the entire network have shown the effectiveness of the proposed model.}

abstract = {The freeway accident detection and classification have attracted much attention of researchers in the past decades. With the popularity of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) on mobile phones and onboard equipment, increasing amounts of real-time vehicle trajectory data can be obtained more and more easily, which provides a potential way to use the multi-vehicle trajectory data to detect and classify an accident on freeways. The data has the advantages of low cost, high penetration, high real-time performance, and being robust to the outdoor environment. Therefore, this paper proposes a new method for accident detection and classification based on the multi-vehicle trajectory data. Different from the existing methods using GNSS positioning data, the proposed method not only uses the position information of the related vehicles but also tries to capture the development tendencies of the trajectories of accident vehicles over a period of time. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network model is developed to recognize an accident from the normal driving of vehicles and also identify the type of the accident, and the six types of traffic accidents are considered in this study. To train and test the proposed model, the simulated trajectory data is generated based on PC-Crash, including the normal driving trajectories and the trajectories before, in, and after an accident. The results indicate that the detection accuracy of the proposed method can reach up to 100\%, and the classification accuracy can reach up to 95\%, which both outperform the existing methods using other data. In addition, to ensure the robustness of the detection accuracy, at least 1 s of duration and 5 Hz of frequency for the trajectory data should be adopted in practice. The study will help to accurately and fastly detect an accident, recognize the accident type, and future judge who is liable for the accident.}

In this paper, we present TRANSIT, TRAjectory inference from Network SIgnaling daTa, a novel framework capable of processing NSD to accurately distinguish mobility phases from stationary activities for individual mobile devices, and reconstruct, at scale, fine-grained human mobility trajectories, by exploiting, with a DBSCAN-based clustering approach, the inherent recurrence of human mobility and the higher sampling rate of NSD. The validation on a ground-truth dataset of GPS trajectories showcases the superior performance of TRANSIT (80\% precision and 96\% recall) with respect to state-of-the-art solutions in the identification of movement periods, as well as an average 190 m spatial accuracy in the estimation of the trajectories. We also leverage TRANSIT to process a unique large-scale NSD dataset of more than 10 millions of individuals and perform an exploratory analysis of city-wide transport mode shares, recurrent commuting paths, urban attractivity and analysis of mobility flows.}

In this study, a unified driver behavior modeling system toward multi-scale behavior recognition is proposed to enhance the driver behavior reasoning ability for intelligent vehicles. Specifically, the driver behavior recognition system is designed to simultaneously recognize the driver's physical and mental states based on a deep encoder-decoder framework. The model jointly learns to recognize three driver behaviors with different time scales: mirror checking and facial expression state, and two mental behaviors, including intention and emotion. The encoder module is designed based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to capture spatial information from the input video stream. Then, several decoders for different driver states estimation are proposed with fully-connected (FC) and long short-term memory (LSTM) based recurrent neural networks (RNN). Two naturalistic datasets are used in this study to investigate the model performance, which is a local highway dataset, namely, CranData, and one public dataset from Brain4Cars. Based on the spatial–temporal representation of driver physical behavior, it shows that the observed physical behaviors can be used to model the latent mental behaviors through the proposed end-to-end learning process. The testing results on these two datasets show state-of-the-art results on mirror checking behavior, intention, and emotion recognition. With the proposed system, intelligent vehicles can gain a holistic understanding of the driver's physical and phycological behaviors to better collaborate and interact with the human driver, and the driver behavior reasoning system helps to reduce the conflicts between the human and vehicle automation.}

abstract = {Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) promise to significantly improve road traffic. To a certain extent, this situation is similar to the expectations at the end of the last century about the positive effects that the introduction of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems would have had on motorway traffic. The parallelism is interesting because ACC equipped vehicles represent the first level of vehicle automation and are now widely available on the market. In this light, studying ACC impacts can help to anticipate potential problems related to its widespread application and to avoid that AVs and CAVs will lead to the same problems. Only a few test-campaigns had been carried out studying the ACC impacts under real-world driving conditions in quantitative terms. To bridge this gap, the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission has organized a number of experimental campaigns involving several ACC-equipped vehicles to study different implications of their widespread. In this context, the present paper summarizes the outcomes of a test campaign involving 10 commercially available ACC-equipped vehicles. The test campaign has been executed in two different test-tracks of the ZalaZONE proving ground, in Hungary. The tests have been carried out at low-speeds (30–60 km/h) and have involved platoons of vehicles of different brands and different powertrains, which were tested in a variety of vehicle orders and with different settings of their ACC systems. Test results have been used to derive information about the properties of the different ACC systems, to study their string stability, to study the effect of ACC systems on traffic flow, and to draw inference about the possible implications on energy consumption and traffic safety. Results confirm the previous findings in terms of string instability of the ACC and highlight that in the present form, ACC systems will possibly lead to higher energy consumption and introduce new safety risks when their penetration in the fleet increases. However, they also highlight that the materialization of the above findings for AVs depends on the operational logic that manufacturers will adopt during the implementation phase. Therefore, results suggest that functional requirements to guarantee string stability and in general to not disrupt the normal flow of traffic should be introduced both for ACC and for any automated system that will be placed on the market in the future.}

abstract = {Map matching is an essential preprocessing step for most trajectory-based intelligent transport system services. Due to device capability constraints and the lack of a high-performance model, map matching for low-sampling-rate trajectories is of particular interest. Therefore, we developed a time-expanded graph matching (TEG-matching) that has three advantages (1) high speed and accuracy, as it is robust for spatial measurement error and a pause such as at traffic lights; (2) being parameter-free, that is, our algorithm has no predetermined hyperparameters; and (3) only requiring ordered locations for map matching. Given a set of low-frequency GPS data, we construct a time-expanded graph (TEG) whose path from source to sink represents a candidate route. We find the shortest path on TEG to obtain the matching route with a small area between the vehicle trajectory. Additionally, we introduce two general speedup techniques (most map matching methods can apply) bottom-up segmentation and fractional cascading. Numerical experiments with worldwide vehicle trajectories in a public dataset show that TEG-matching outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and speed, and we verify the effectiveness of the two general speedup techniques.}

Despite abundant studies in this research area, most of them only consider trajectory planning in the longitudinal dimension or assume the fully CAV environment. This study proposes an approach to the decentralized planning of CAV trajectories at an isolated signalized intersection under the mixed traffic environment, which consists of connected and human-driven vehicles (CHVs) and CAVs. A bi-level optimization model is formulated based on discrete time to optimize both the longitudinal and lateral trajectories of a single CAV given signal timings and the trajectory information of surrounding vehicles. The upper-level model optimizes lateral lane-changing strategies. The lower-level model optimizes longitudinal acceleration profiles based on the lane-changing strategies from the upper-level model. Minimization of vehicle delay, fuel consumption, and lane-changing costs are considered in the objective functions. A Lane-Changing Strategy Tree (LCST) and a Parallel Monte-Carlo Tree Search (PMCTS) algorithm are designed to solve the bi-level optimization model. CAV trajectories are planned one by one according to their distance to the stop bar. A rolling horizon scheme is applied for the dynamic implementation of the proposed model with time-varying traffic conditions. Numerical studies validate the advantages of the proposed trajectory planning model compared with the benchmark cases without CAV trajectory planning. The average fuel consumption and lane-changing numbers of CAVs can be reduced noticeably, especially with high traffic demand. The delay of CAVs is reduced by ~2 s on average, which is limited due to the fixed signal timing plans. The trajectory planning of CAVs also reduces the delay and the fuel consumption of CHVs and the mixed traffic, especially with high penetration rates of CAVs. The sensitivity analysis shows that the control zone length of 200 m is sufficient to ensure the satisfactory performance of the proposed model.}

For high frequency services, the literature suggests that passenger arrivals are random and that under perfectly random conditions with all other factors held constant, wait times are equivalent to half of the headway between trains. We test this hypothesis using large-scale smart card and vehicle location data, which enables the extraction of access times from total passenger journey times as well as the precise measurement of train headways. Using a semiparametric regression modelling framework, we generate non-linear estimates of the relationship between access times and headway while conditioning for other service supply and demand factors. Marginal platform wait times are then derived numerically via an exposure–response model framework which accounts for potential confounding between the walking and waiting components of access times, thus enabling quantification of the unbiased impact of headways on wait times. For three lines in central London, we observe that marginal wait times transition from greater than half of the headway to approximately one third of the headway as train frequencies decrease. The transition occurs in the range between 2-3 min headways, lower than earlier estimates in the literature. A series of numerical simulations illustrate the importance of waiting time sensitivity in the optimisation of public transport services. In comparison with the standard wait time assumption, our exercise reveals that the degree of density economies is milder than what the literature suggests, and this may neutralise some of the economic justifications of high public transport subsidies.}

Dwell times can be obtained from Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) data, or door opening and closing records. This data is often more obtainable than the direct demand information based on passenger counts or fare collection information. A flexible Bayesian framework allowing for various dwell time models is employed to infer the passenger demand profile conditional on the observed bus dwell times. We model passenger flows by stop-specific arrival rates and a conditional alighting probability matrix. A modified gravity model is used to further explain the alighting probability matrix and to reduce the number of unknown parameters. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling is implemented to draw the posterior distribution for the parameters of interest. The methodology is validated by three lines of a bus system where alighting times are the main activity time. For these lines dwell time as well as passenger count data are available. The case study shows that accurate estimates of alighting flows and passenger loads can be derived by the proposed framework with dwell times only but that room remains for improving the accuracy of boarding flows and OD flows. Additional boarding counts of a few bus runs, which can be easily integrated into the observation block of the estimation framework, raise the estimation accuracy of boarding and OD flows to an acceptable level. We therefore conclude that the proposed methodology can help “data-poor” bus operators to overcome demand estimation problems for transit planning and operation.}

Our approach learns the spatiotemporal state-value function using a batch training algorithm with deep value networks. The optimal repositioning action is generated on-demand through value-based policy search, which combines planning and bootstrapping with the value networks. For the large-fleet problems, we develop several algorithmic features that we incorporate into our framework and that we demonstrate to induce coordination among the algorithmically-guided vehicles. We benchmark our algorithm with baselines in a ride-hailing simulation environment to demonstrate its superiority in improving income efficiency measured by income-per-hour. We have also designed and run a real-world experiment program with regular drivers on a major ride-hailing platform. We have observed significantly positive results on key metrics comparing our method with experienced drivers who performed idle-time repositioning based on their own expertise.}

To date, research based on such simulations is rarely replicable as it is based on proprietary data and tools. To foster the discussion and steer research towards reproducible transport simulations, this paper introduces a process for generating a synthetic travel demand with individual households, persons, and their daily activity chains for Paris and its surrounding region Île-de-France — entirely based on open data and open software and replicable by any researcher. The resulting travel demand is published for others to use as a comprehensive data basis for agent-based transport simulations and as a test bed for population and demand synthesis algorithms. Furthermore, it is discussed how implicit correlation structures impact the potential use cases of the synthetic travel demand for simulation and analysis purposes and how the common practice of using population samples for downstream simulations affects the results.}

First, we define a combination of network-related trajectory features that helps us unravel the critical trips which contribute the most to the network under-performance, based on the literature review and a factor selection process. Second, based on supervised learning methods, we propose a two-step data-driven methodological framework to reroute a part of the users and make the system close to its optimum. The learning models are trained with trajectory features to identify which users should be selected, and which alternative routes should be assigned, thanks to the data and features obtained from two reference dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) simulations, under User-Equilibrium (UE) and System-Optimum (SO). We only focus on trajectory features that are accessible in real time, such as network features and regular travel time information, so that the methods proposed can be implemented without requiring cumbersome network monitoring and prediction. Finally, we evaluate the efficiency of the methods proposed through microscopic DTA simulations. The results show that by targeting 20\% of the users according to our selection model and moving them onto paths predicted as optimal alternative paths based on our rerouting model, the total travel time (TTT) of the system is reduced by 5.9\% in comparison to a UE DTA simulation. This represents 62.5\% of the potential TTT reduction from UE to SO, when all the users choose their path under the SO condition.}

Reliable trajectory prediction models need to consider uncertainties coming from multiple sources. Environmental factor is one of the most significant reasons affecting trajectory prediction models and is the focus of this study. This paper propose an advanced Bayesian Deep Learning method for aircraft trajectory prediction considering weather impacts. A brief review of both deterministic and probabilistic trajectory prediction methods is given, with a specific focus on learning-based methods. Next, a deterministic trajectory prediction model with classical deep learning methods is proposed to handle both spatial and temporal information using a nested convolution neural network, recurrent neural network, and fully-connected neural network. Following this, the deterministic neural network model is extended to be a Bayesian deep learning model to consider uncertainties where the posterior distributions of parameters are estimated with variational inference for enhanced efficiency. Both mean prediction and confidence intervals are obtained giving the last on-file flight plans and weather data in the region. The proposed methodology is validated using air traffic and weather data from the Sherlock data warehouse. Data pre-processing procedures for big data analytics are discussed in detail. Demonstration and metrics-based validation are performed during severe convective weather conditions for several air traffic control centers. The results show a significant reduction in prediction variance. A comparison with existing methods is also performed. Several conclusions and future works are given based on the proposed study.}

A stochastic microscopic model is used to estimate traffic state parameters based on speed, location, and travel time information from connected vehicles. Traffic state predictions are obtained on a lane by lane basis using an adaptive Kalman filter (AKF) that fuses fixed detector measurements with the model; the AKF then produces multiple step ahead predictions. The ramp metering problem in this paper is modeled as a stochastic distributed model predictive control (SDMPC) approach. The SDMPC problem is solved based on a bargaining game approach where each controller, a player in the game, receives traffic state and control decision information from other controllers to solve the local optimization problem based on expected local costs and constraints. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated for three aspects of efficiency: short-term and long-term equity and effectiveness compared to multiple control scenarios. The outcomes indicate that the proposed cooperative model with stochastic capacity considerations outperforms the deterministic capacity-based models in regard to effectiveness and equity properties. However, the centralized approach performs slightly better in respect to system-wide efficiency.}

abstract = {The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) with the energy grid has become an important area of research due to the increasing EV penetration in today’s transportation systems. Under appropriate management of EV charging and discharging, the grid can currently satisfy the energy requirements of a considerable number of EVs. Furthermore, EVs can help enhance the reliability and stability of the energy grid through ancillary services such as energy storage. This paper proposes the EV routing problem with time windows under time-variant electricity prices (EVRPTW-TP) which optimizes the routing of an EV fleet that are delivering products to customers, jointly with the scheduling of the charging and discharging of the EVs from/to the grid. The proposed model is a multiperiod vehicle routing problem where EVs can stop at charging stations to either recharge their batteries or inject stored energy to the grid. Given the energy costs that vary based on time-of-use, the charging and discharging schedules of the EVs are optimized to benefit from the capability of storing energy by shifting energy demands from peak hours to off-peak hours when the energy price is lower. The vehicles can recover the energy costs and potentially realize profits by injecting energy back to the grid at high price periods. EVRPTW-TP is formulated as an optimization problem. A Lagrangian relaxation approach and a hybrid variable neighborhood search/tabu search heuristic are proposed to obtain high quality lower bounds and feasible solutions, respectively. Numerical experiments on instances from the literature are provided. The proposed heuristic is also evaluated on a case study of an EV fleet providing grocery delivery at the region of Kitchener-Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. Insights on the impacts of energy pricing, service time slots, range reduction in winter as well as fleet size are presented.}

Trajectories with known cycle lengths are accumulated on one space–time plot with their respective green start times at the origin, and then Edie’s generalized definitions of traffic variables are adapted to construct a full-scale fundamental diagram. The approach is tested empirically, and the averages and variances of the estimated quantities were within the expected ranges for each type of movement. Results from several movements were also verified against field measurements from a short video recording. The proposed method enables estimations of saturation flow rates over entire networks based on long-term datasets, instead of short-term field measurements. The approach is particularly advantageous for estimations under the unpredictable conditions associated with conflicting movements.}

The difficulty lies in simultaneously obtaining the optimal multivariable solution for spatial pricing and sequential solution for dynamic pricing, considering the heterogeneity, dynamics, and imbalance of on-demand ride supply/demand. Due to this problem's complexity, most studies have simplified the modeling setting and omitted the complicated matching and waiting process between drivers and passengers. To go beyond the existing models, this paper proposes a reinforcement learning enhanced agent-based modeling and simulation (RL-ABMS) system to reveal the complex mechanism in the ride-sourcing system and tackle the problem of spatial–temporal pricing for a ride-sourcing platform. The reinforcement learning approach proximal policy optimization (PPO) is implemented in the RL-ABMS system, where two feed-forward neural networks are built as critic and actor. The critic judges the goodness of the current state, and the actor generates the optimal pricing strategy.Compared with the fixed pricing strategy, the experimental results on a real-world urban network show that dynamic pricing raises the platform's profit to 1.25 times, and spatial–temporal pricing even raises it to 1.85 times. Besides, the number of idle drivers/vehicles has significantly dropped under the spatial–temporal pricing strategy, which indicates that our proposed strategy has a remarkable effect on coordinating supply and demand in the ride-sourcing market.}

abstract = {We propose a multi-hop control scheme (MHCS) that aims to route traffic through a set of designated intermediate checkpoints (ICs). Because travelers are allowed to freely choose routes for each “hop” that connects real (origin and destination) and ICs, MHCS promises to keep intervention at a more tolerable level, compared to conventional route-based control schemes. The MHCS problem has a natural bi-level structure: the upper level attempts to minimize congestion by adjusting the hopping ratios, which are then used in the lower level problem to route travelers according to user equilibrium conditions. Accordingly, we formulate the problem as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC), establish its solution existence, and propose to solve it using a sensitivity analysis based algorithm. We examine sixteen heuristic rules for choosing ICs. Results based on five hundred experiments suggest that selecting the most used and most congested nodes at system optimum as the ICs delivered the largest travel time savings. Based on this finding, a set of efficient ICs are identified and adopted to test the potential of a full-scale scheme. The results from numerical experiments indicate that these checkpoints are highly effective in reducing traffic congestion at a reasonable cost of control and unfairness. In particular, they outperform, by a large margin, other choices such as most congested nodes at user equilibrium.}

Literature from stated preference surveys find that attitudes and current travel behavior are as or more important than demographics in determining intention to purchase or use AVs. Yet to date no study has looked at how attitudes and use of existing modes both simultaneously affect AV adoption. In this study, we conduct a stated preference survey in Singapore to investigate how the subjective evaluation of existing travel modes (attitudes) and inertia based on previous use of existing modes affect the adoption of an autonomous mobility-on-demand service (AMOD). Using a sample size of 2,003 individuals and 11,613 choice observations, we estimate a mixed logit discrete choice model incorporating latent variables capturing subjective evaluations of existing travel modes (determined through confirmatory factor analysis), a two-part formulation of modal inertia, and other trip-specific and socio-demographic variables. Results show that subjective evaluation and use of existing modes both affect the adoption of AMOD. Specifically, people with a positive evaluation of ridehailing and those who are current ridehailing users are more likely to choose AMOD. Additionally, those who are current car drivers are more likely to choose AMOD, while users of public transit were less likely to choose AMOD. Given that ridehailing is the closest existing mode to our hypothetical AMOD service, our results might suggest that how AVs are implemented and their similarity to existing modes may be critical to the formation of attitudes and direction of inertia impacting adoption. Our research provides insights on the potential relationship between AVs and existing modes that could valuable in AV network design and service planning.}

abstract = {Road congestion induces significant costs across the world, and road network disturbances, such as traffic accidents, can cause highly congested traffic patterns. If a planner had control over the routing of all vehicles in the network, they could easily reverse this effect. In a more realistic scenario, we consider a planner that controls autonomous cars, which are a fraction of all present cars. We study a dynamic routing game, in which the route choices of autonomous cars can be controlled and the human drivers react selfishly and dynamically. As the problem is prohibitively large, we use deep reinforcement learning to learn a policy for controlling the autonomous vehicles. This policy indirectly influences human drivers to route themselves in such a way that minimizes congestion on the network. To gauge the effectiveness of our learned policies, we establish theoretical results characterizing equilibria and empirically compare the learned policy results with best possible equilibria. We prove properties of equilibria on parallel roads and provide a polynomial-time optimization for computing the most efficient equilibrium. Moreover, we show that in the absence of these policies, high demand and network perturbations would result in large congestion, whereas using the policy greatly decreases the travel times by minimizing the congestion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that employs deep reinforcement learning to reduce congestion by indirectly influencing humans’ routing decisions in mixed-autonomy traffic.}

Although a few studies have investigated the opinion of people who have physically experienced AVs, the understanding regarding how the experienced users can integrate AV-based services into real life is limited. To address this gap, the present study examines the travel characteristics of autonomous taxi trips and the determinants of continuous use intention. The data used in this study were collected in Guangzhou, China where paid autonomous taxi service have been publicly accessible and operated for one year. The analysis of the autonomous taxi trips revealed that this novel mobility choice has been accepted and extensively used by experienced users. In addition, five market segments were identified according to the supplement and alternative travel mode to autonomous taxi trips. Results indicate a possible mode shift from public transport to autonomous taxis. The role of a safety steward on board was also identified. Findings suggest that takeover action influences the acceptable time for fully autonomous driving and the preference for autonomous taxis. Certain factors—service satisfaction, psychological ownership, and concern for the equality of safety—for autonomous taxi use are considered in this study. On this basis, an extended technology acceptance model is proposed to explain the continuous use intention of autonomous taxis. The maintenance of a positive attitude toward use, which underlines the simplicity and usefulness of autonomous taxis and the improvement of service quality, is essential for experienced users. Furthermore, the approaches that establish psychological ownership and alleviate the concern for the equality of safety can also enhance the continuous use intention. Interestingly, the effect of concern for the equality of safety on continuous use intention is larger when experienced users do not or seldom encounter takeovers. The research contributes to the ongoing research related to the real-life application of AVs, with implications for urban transportation managers, mobility providers, and automobile industry players.}

abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an alternative approach for optimizing the traffic signal control system. However, there is a restricted exploration problem encountered when a signal control model is trained with a predefined demand scenario in the traffic simulation. With the restricted exploration, the model learns a policy based only on partial experiences in the search space, which yields a partially-trained policy. Partially-trained policy fails to adapt to some unexperienced (‘unexplored’, ‘never-before-seen’) dataset that have different distributions from the training dataset. Although this issue has critical effects on training a signal control model, it has not been considered in the literature. Therefore, this research aims to obtain a transferable policy to enhance the model’s applicability on unexperienced traffic states. The key idea is to represent the state as graph-structured data, and train it using a graph neural network (GNN). Since this approach enables to learn the relationship between the features resulting from the spatial structure of the intersection, it is able to transfer the already-learned knowledge of the relationship to the unexperienced data. In order to investigate the transferability, an experiment is conducted on five unexperienced test demand scenarios. For the evaluation, the performance of the proposed GNN model is compared with the conventional DQN model that is based on vector-valued state. At first, the models are trained with only a single dataset (training demand scenario). Then, they are tested with different unexperienced dataset (test demand scenarios) without additional trainings. The results show that the proposed GNN model obtains a transferable policy so that it adapts better to the unexperienced traffic states, while the conventional DQN model fails.}

A novel graph-to-sequence learning architecture with attention mechanism (AG2S-Net) is developed to predict the multi-step-ahead hourly departure and arrival delay of the entire network. The proposed AG2S-Net consists of a graph convolution neural network, a bi-LSTM neural network, and a sequence-to-sequence framework with embedded attention mechanism. Five-year flight data of 75 airports and 242 links are collected from the National Airspace System to illustrate the procedure. First, K-means clustering algorithm is applied to classify the hourly flight delay states of the entire network into four typical delay patterns, which are further used as explanatory variables in prediction model. Then, the network-wide multi-step-ahead flight delay prediction model is built with the proposed AG2S-Net. The result indicates that the model achieves better performance on large-scale airports than small-scale airports. The delay pattern variables and weather variables can greatly improve the prediction performance. In addition, compared with several benchmark methods, the AG2S-Net performs the best for all three airport types in terms of the lowest RMSE and MAE values. Finally, the graph network analysis further reveals that the proposed AG2S-Net can capture the hidden correlations between airports without links and collect information from more airports in the same community to enhance the prediction performance. The results of this study could provide insightful suggestions for aviation authorities and airport regulators to develop effective air traffic control strategies for alleviating flight delays and improving operation efficiency of the entire network.}

abstract = {As an alternative to traditional taxi services, Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) such as Uber and Lyft are playing an increasingly important role in the paradigm shifting from car ownership to mobility as a service. We consider an electric vehicle fleet charging scheduling problem in the TNC setting where taxi drivers, as freelancers, have their individual preferences regarding when and where to charge their vehicles. In this setting, obtaining social welfare maximizing schedules is particularly difficult as drivers may behave strategically in competing over shared charging resources to advance their own benefits rather than the system wide social welfare. We propose a negotiation mechanism which allows drivers to collectively evolve an incumbent schedule into a socially beneficial one through an iterative voting process. The proposed mechanism provides a platform which enables multilateral negotiation among a large number of drivers. We prove that, given the design of the proposed mechanism, drivers’ best response strategy is to truthfully vote their best valued candidate schedules according to the acceptance quota prescribed by the scheduler at each voting round. In addition, experiment results show that the mechanism achieves on average 93\% efficiency compared with optimal solutions and scales well to larger problem instances.}

abstract = {Smart card (SC) data has become one of the major data sources for transit passengers’ behavior analysis, network modeling, and control optimization. Origin–destination (O–D) estimation has been recognized as a requisite step before utilizing the smart card data to investigate transit passengers’ spatiotemporal dynamics or conduct other SC data-based transit modeling. In the recent decade, the extant literature has proposed various trip-chain-based methods for transit O-D estimation using SC data. However, one problem of the conventional trip-chaining estimation approach has been noticed but not paid enough attention to: O-D estimation of single transactions cannot be conducted since the trip-chain method generally requires at least two trip records per day to proceed with. Such a flaw in the classic trip-chain approach might lead to a considerable amount of data loss and inaccurate O-D estimation. This paper improved the existing trip-chain O-D estimation method by introducing a new framework based on the Minimum Entropy Rate (MER) criterion. The proposed MER-based method adopts a similar mechanism of noise reduction in information theory. The basic idea of our approach is to infer the alighting location of single trips using alternative stops that preserve passengers’ travel regularity exhibiting in their mobility sequences. Our enhanced approach can estimate alighting stops for single trips with decent accuracy, thus preventing a potential massive data loss. Moreover, the study also provides an in-depth insight into the relationship between entropy rates estimated using trip sequences and passengers’ travel regularity. The estimation results can further benefit future transit studies with reliable data sources.}

abstract = {Ridesourcing platforms recently introduced the “schedule a ride” service where passengers may reserve (book-ahead) a ride in advance of their trip. Reservations give platforms precise information that describes the start time and location of anticipated future trips; in turn, platforms can use this information to adjust the availability and spatial distribution of the driver supply. In this article, we propose a framework for modeling/analyzing reservations in time-varying stochastic ridesourcing systems. We consider that the driver supply is distributed over a network of geographic regions and that book-ahead rides have reach time priority over non-reserved rides. First, we propose a state-dependent admission control policy that assigns drivers to passengers; this policy ensures that the reach time service requirement would be attained for book-ahead rides. Second, given the admission control policy and reservations information in each region, we predict the “target” number of drivers that is required (in the future) to probabilistically guarantee the reach time service requirement for stochastic non-reserved rides. Third, we propose a reactive dispatching/rebalancing mechanism that determines the adjustments to the driver supply that are needed to maintain the targets across regions. For a specific reach time quality of service, simulation results using data from Lyft rides in Manhattan exhibit how the number of idle drivers decreases with the fraction of book-ahead rides. We also observe that the non-stationary demand (ride request) rate varies significantly across time; this rapid variation further illustrates that time-dependent models are needed for operational analysis of ridesourcing systems.}

We use a hybrid Delphi-Analytic Hierarchic Process (AHP) technique to objectively select, combine and weight the different criteria to more reliable MCA outcomes. The analysis has been performed for different rail market segments including high-speed, mainline, regional, urban and freight corridors. The results show that there is a highly different technological maturity level between MB and VC given the larger number of vital issues not yet solved for VC. The MCA also indicates that VC could outperform MB for all market segments if it reaches a comparable maturity and safety level. The provided analysis can effectively support the railway industry in strategic investment planning of VC.}

There are many attempts to predict short-term traffic flows using various deep learning algorithms. Most existing prediction models are only tested on spatiotemporal data assuming no missing data entries. However, this ideal situation rarely exists in real world due to sensor or network transmission failure. Missing data is a nonnegligible problem. Previous studies either remove time series with missing entries or impute missing data before building prediction models. The former may cause insufficient data for model training, while the latter adds extra computational burden and the imputation accuracy has direct impacts on the prediction performance. In this study, we propose an online framework that can make spatiotemporal predictions based on raw incomplete data and impute possible missing values at the same time. We design a novel spatial and temporal regularized matrix factorization model, namely LSTM-GL-ReMF, as the key component of the framework. The Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) model is chosen as the temporal regularizer to capture temporal dependency in time series data and the Graph Laplacian (GL) serves as the spatial regularizer to utilize spatial correlations among network sensors to enhance prediction and imputation performance. The proposed framework integrating with the LSTM-GL-ReMF model are tested and compared with other state-of-the-art matrix factorization models and deep learning models on three uni-variate and multi-variate spatiotemporal traffic datasets. The experimental results show our approach has a robust and accurate performance in terms of prediction and imputation accuracy under various data missing scenarios.}

Many fundamental analyses of transportation systems rely on the origin–destination demand matrix of the network. Although extraction of origin–destination travel demand for public transportation networks from ticketing data is not a new problem, yet it entails challenges, such as ‘alighting transaction inference’ and ‘transfer identification’ which are worthy of further attention. This is mainly because the state-of-the-art solutions to these challenges, are often heavily reliant on network-specific expert knowledge and extensive parameter setting, or multiple data sources. In this paper, we propose a procedure that effectively applies statistical pattern recognition techniques to address the main challenges in extracting the origin–destination demand from passenger smartcard records. Learning from patterns in the available data allows the procedure to perform well under minimum case-specific assumptions, thus it becomes applicable to smartcard data from various public transportation systems. The performance of the proposed framework is tested on a dataset of over 100 million smartcard transaction records from Melbourne’s multi-modal public transportation network. Evaluations on different aspects of the proposed procedure, suggest that the identified tasks are well addressed, and the framework is able to extract an accurate estimation of the origin–destination demand matrix for the system.}

This paper proposes a novel hierarchical integrated machine learning model for predicting flight departure delays and duration in series rather than in parallel to avoid ambiguity in decision making. The paper analyses the proposed model using various machine learning algorithms in combination with different sampling techniques. The highly noisy, unbalanced, dispersed, and skewed historical high dimensional data provided by an international airline operating in Hong Kong was used to demonstrate the practical application of the model. The result shows that for a 4-h forecast horizon, a constructive neural network machine learning algorithm with the Synthetic Minority Over Sampling Technique-Tomek Links (SMOTETomek) sampling technique was able to achieve better average balanced recall accuracies of 65.5\%, 61.5\%, 59\% for classifying delay status and predicting delay duration at thresholds of 60 min and 30 min, respectively. Similarly, for minority labels, the precision-recall and area under the curve showed that the proposed model achieved better results of 32.44\% and 35.14\% compared to the parallel model of 26.43\% and 21.02\% for thresholds of 60 min and 30 min, respectively.

We utilize analytical and numerical tools to evaluate these metrics as a function of (i) the location of the roadside units along the road, (ii) the communication range of the roadside units, and (iii) the penetration rate of connected vehicles on the road. We show that considerable amount of traffic predictions can be achieved even with sparsely distributed roadside units as distant as two thousand meters and with connected vehicle penetration rate as low as 2\%.

To cope with the high dimensional solution space, the data-driven component is incorporated as a multi-layer artificial neural network and is used to approximate future traffic states and system performances with respect to prevailing control settings. Before the controller can be used, the neural network is to be trained through a series of realised dynamic state transitions via an on-policy temporal difference learning algorithm. The proposed control framework is tested over a real world corridor scenario in London, UK. The proposed controller is able to reduce both traffic delays and bus service variabilities subject to stochastic demands with acyclic timing plans that can be derived in short computational time.

The aim of the optimal train control problem in the paper is to enhance the train operation performance in regard to the operational safety, maintenance costs and running efficiency. In the train control model, the characteristics of the heavy haul train, the speed limits and constraints on the air-refilling time of the train pipe are taken into consideration. Then the train control process on the long and steep downhill section is described as a Markov decision process for the application of the reinforcement learning (RL) technique. Further, the critical elements of RL are designed and an intelligent control method on the basis of the DQN algorithm is developed to address the optimal train control problem in this paper. Finally, experimental simulations are carried out with the actual data of the Shuozhou-Huanghua Line such that the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed DQN-based control method are verified.}

ADS failures are a major contributor to the disengagements of AV testing on public roads and influence human–ADS interactions. The impact of ADS failures (malfunctions or limits) was only examined in the driving simulator environment and mainly on self-reported trust in the ADS or AVs. Utilizing simulators to investigate the influence of ADS failures might lack ecological validity. Participants in this environment might find it hard to imagine the risk of ADS failures and the criticality of taking immediate manual control. We conducted a field study with a real Level 3 AV and a large-scale test track. We invited participants (N = 261) to experience the AV and an ADS malfunction as passengers in a naturalistic driving environment, exposing almost half the participants to the malfunction. Witnessing the malfunction caused participants’ reductions in six psychological responses to AVs and ADS (trust, positive affect, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude, and behavioral intention) and increased negative affect. This finding highlights the importance of mitigating the detrimental influences of ADS malfunctions. Trust repair deserves consideration in maintaining adequate human–machine cooperation in AVs after ADS malfunctions.}

abstract = {Traffic management on (smart) motorways is becoming increasingly important to extract the most out of the limited capacity that is available, especially during peak periods. Accurate modelling of traffic management measures in traffic flow simulation is therefore paramount to make accurate short, and/or long-term predictions, to aid offline and online applications. In this work we propose a novel macroscopic network loading model that supports variable speed limits (VSL). Most existing aggregate network loading models that support VSL impose speed limits instantaneously across the entire road section, ignoring the fact that only vehicles passing the speed limit sign are aware of the new limit (either by a driver seeing the signal, or in case of autonomous/connected vehicles via infrastructure-to vehicle-technology), this leads to a discrepancy between model and reality that one ideally would want to avoid. Another challenge that arises is that current state-of-the-art macroscopic network loading models, such as the link transmission model (LTM), do not track the internal state of the link while constructing their solution. This is especially useful in large-scale (macroscopic) simulations where its increased efficiency is valued highly. Unfortunately, this desirable property makes modelling traffic management measures such as VSL much more challenging. Virtually all existing methods to date rely on tracking the link’s internal state to support VSL. Therefore, very few methods exist that offer proper support for VSL in LTM. At the same time, the methods that do exist have various limitations. In this work we propose a continuous-time LTM model that address these limitations, yields exact solutions, and supports VSL. The proposed solution method is an extension of the event-based LTM of Bliemer and Raadsen (2019) and Raadsen and Bliemer (2019) which can be considered a special case with a single speed limit. Three case studies are provided to demonstrate feasibility and general applicability of the proposed method and solution algorithm.}

Such maps, if they are constructed at lane-level, have many applications in traffic analysis, especially the study of driving behavior based on floating car data. In this paper, we present a three-step automatic method based on QuickBundles for the node detection in the road network, a dissimilarity matrix based on Fréchet distance for road centerline construction, and the Gaussian Mixture Method for lane estimation. The results are a smooth, segment-based centerline unbiased by GPS density distribution over lanes with accurate road width as well as compatible and highly accurate estimation of lanes. The accuracy, connectivity, compatibility, validity, and robustness of the proposed method have been tested in various ways. The results of this paper show that this method, while being low cost, can construct accurate lane-level routable digital maps that can be used as a platform for extracting longitudinal and lateral driving behavior, especially drivers' lane-changing maneuvers. Due to the unique features of the proposed method, the width of the lanes remains constant along the entire length of the road segments. In addition, the validation of the method based on traffic metrics shows that the constructed maps can be used to obtain reliable estimates of the speed and volume of traffic flow in different lanes. Being derived from actual trajectories, the inferred lane markings may deviate from the physical ones if the driver population systematically deviates laterally, for instance in curves; depending on the application use case of the resulting map, this may be a desirable or undesirable feature.}

abstract = {Trajectory smoothing is an effective concept to control connected automated vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic to reduce traffic oscillations and improve overall traffic performance. However, smoother trajectories often lead to greater gaps between vehicles, which may incentivize human driven vehicles (HVs) from adjacent lanes to make cut-in lane changes. Such cut-in lane changes may compromise the expected performance from CAV trajectory smoothing. To figure out the reasons behind the issue, this paper designs a mixed traffic framework at a signalized intersection with multi-lane roads considering detailed trajectory control, car following and lane changing maneuvers all together. Based on the framework, this paper proposes a decentralized lane-change-aware CAV trajectory optimization model including discretionary lane change restraining and mandatory lane change yielding strategies. Riding comfort and traffic mobility are considered as a joint objective. And the complex non-linear lane-change-aware constraints are linearized to convert the proposed problem to a quadratic optimization problem. The linearization allows the investigated problem to be easily fed into a commercial solver. Numerical experiments are conducted to study the performance of the proposed model and to compare it with other models (e.g., a cooperative lane change model and a trajectory optimization model without the lane-change-aware mechanism) in different scenarios. First, results show that the HV lane changes cause reduction of half or more expected benefits of trajectory smoothing along a multi-lane segment adjacent to a signalized intersection. Then, we find that the proposed model outperforms the other models. Especially, the proposed model yields extra benefits in the system joint objective (10–25\%), riding comfort (10–25\%), travel time (1–8\%), fuel consumption (3–15\%) and safety (5–25\%) compared with the trajectory optimization model without the lane-change-aware mechanism when CAV market penetration rate is not high. Sensitivity analyses on road segment lengths, signal cycle lengths, traffic saturation rates and through-vehicle rates show that the proposed model yields better system performance under most scenarios, e.g., 20\% extra benefit at a short road segment length, 30\% extra benefit at a long signal cycle length, 25\% extra benefit at a high traffic saturation rate, and 25\% extra benefit at a high through-vehicle rate.}

abstract = {There have been conflicting results in the literature regarding the congestion impacts of shared mobility systems with for-hire vehicles (FHVs). To the best of our knowledge, there is no physically meaningful and mathematically tractable model to explain these conflicting results or devise efficient management schemes for such mobility systems. In this paper, we attempt to fill the gap by presenting a compartmental model for passenger trip and vehicle dynamics in shared mobility systems with FHVs and discussing the impacts of different fleet-size management schemes. To develop the compartmental model, we first divide passenger trips into four compartments: planned, waiting, traveling, and completed. We describe the dynamics of the waiting trips by the point queue model, and those of the traveling trips by an extended bathtub model. As the traditional bathtub model for vehicular trips, the extended bathtub model is derived in a relative space with respect to individual trips’ distances to their destinations. However, different from the traditional bathtub model, vehicular dynamics and trip dynamics in the extended bathtub model are not overlapping, as the dynamics of FHVs are controlled by the fleet-size management scheme; but they are related, as traveling trips travel with occupied FHVs, and empty FHVs supply seats to waiting trips. Within this modeling framework, the matching process between waiting passengers and FHVs is modeled at the aggregate level, such that the passenger trip flow from the waiting compartment to the traveling compartment equals the minimum of the waiting trips’ demand of seats and the supply of seats determined by the completion rate of traveling trips and the fleet-size management scheme. In addition to the pooling ratio, the deadhead miles, the detour miles caused by pooling services, and other extra miles associated with the matching process are captured by another exogenous parameter, namely, the extra mileage ratio. With these assumptions and simplifications, the resulting compartmental model is a deterministic, coupled queueing model, which can be written as a system of differential equations. We also present the sufficient and necessary condition on the fleet-size management scheme for the model to be well-defined. With the parsimonious, closed-form compartmental model, we demonstrate theoretically that limiting the wait time leads to a fleet-size management scheme equivalent to that of the privately operated vehicles (POVs), i.e., the POV scheme. In such a system, the completion rate depends on the extra trip mileage ratio, as well as the pooling ratio. With 100\% autonomous FHVs, the optimal fleet size that minimizes the total costs occurs at the maximum flow-rate and the free-flow speed. With mixed POVs and FHVs, we extend the compartmental model and numerically solve for the optimal fleet sizes under different market penetration rates. This study reconciles the conflicting results in the literature. We find that, with a low pooling ratio, the overall system’s performance can be deteriorated or improved, depending on the fleet-size management scheme: with the POV scheme, the system could become more congested; but with an appropriate fleet-size cap, the system’s performance can be substantially improved. A major policy implication of this study is that implementing a cap for the FHV fleet size is a viable measure to mitigate the congestion effects of extra deadhead and detour miles caused by FHVs.}

abstract = {Urban rail transit (URT) has been considered an effective means of addressing urban congestion problems in metropolises. The operations of a URT system involve high energy consumption and its trade-off with passenger travel times. Existing energy-efficient timetabling studies have predominately focused on single URT lines and thus are incapable of accurately modeling the energy consumption in a URT network with transfer opportunities and synchronization between the URT lines. To extend the energy-efficient timetabling from one single line to multiple interlinked lines, we propose a bi-level model incorporating the operator’s decision on a regular timetable and passengers’ path choice in a URT network. The objective of energy consumption and timetable constraints of the upper level are linearized and formulated as mixed-integer linear programming. The lower level captures the user equilibrium based path choice behavior responding to the timetable. We develop a heuristic algorithm for the bi-level model that produces near-optimal timetable solutions in a relaxation process. The proposed model and solution algorithm are validated in the URT network of Xi’an (China). It is found that the energy consumption is considerably reduced, compared with using the current timetable, at the expense of an acceptable increase in the average travel time.}

abstract = {Missing value problem in spatiotemporal traffic data has long been a challenging topic, in particular for large-scale and high-dimensional data with complex missing mechanisms and diverse degrees of missingness. Recent studies based on tensor nuclear norm have demonstrated the superiority of tensor learning in imputation tasks by effectively characterizing the complex correlations/dependencies in spatiotemporal data. However, despite the promising results, these approaches do not scale well to large data tensors. In this paper, we focus on addressing the missing data imputation problem for large-scale spatiotemporal traffic data. To achieve both high accuracy and efficiency, we develop a scalable tensor learning model—Low-Tubal-Rank Smoothing Tensor Completion (LSTC-Tubal)—based on the existing framework of Low-Rank Tensor Completion, which is well-suited for spatiotemporal traffic data that is characterized by multidimensional structure of location × time of day × day. In particular, the proposed LSTC-Tubal model involves a scalable tensor nuclear norm minimization scheme by integrating linear unitary transformation. Therefore, tensor nuclear norm minimization can be solved by singular value thresholding on the transformed matrix of each day while the day-to-day correlation can be effectively preserved by the unitary transform matrix. Before setting up the experiment, we consider some real-world data sets, including two large-scale 5-min traffic speed data sets collected by the California PeMS system with 11160 sensors: 1) PeMS-4W covers the data over 4 weeks (i.e., 288×28 time points), and 2) PeMS-8W covers the data over 8 weeks (i.e., 288×56 time points). We compare LSTC-Tubal with some state-of-the-art baseline models, and find that LSTC-Tubal can achieve competitively accuracy with a significantly lower computational cost. In addition, the LSTC-Tubal will also benefit other tasks in modeling large-scale spatiotemporal traffic data, such as network-level traffic forecasting.}

Except from social distancing and wearing face masks, restricting the movement of people is one important measure necessary to control the spread. Such decisions on the lock-down/reduction of movement should be made in an informed way and, accordingly, modeled as an optimization problem. We propose the Early-stage Transportation Lock-down and Quarantine Problem (TLQP), which can help to decide which parts of the transportation infrastructure of a country should be restricted in early stages. On top of the network-based Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, we establish a decision recommendation framework, which considers the lock-down of cross-border traffic, internal traffic, and movement inside individual populations. The combinatorial optimization problem aims to find the best set of actions which minimize the social cost of a lock-down. Given the inherent intractability of this problem, we develop a highly-efficient heuristic based on the Effective Distance (ED) path and the Cost-Effective Lazy Forward (CELF) algorithm. We perform and report experiments on the global spread of COVID-19 and show how individual countries may protect their population by taking appropriate measures against the threatening pandemic. We believe that our study contributes to the orchestration of measures for dealing with current and future epidemic outbreaks.}

abstract = {An adequate understanding of consumer affinity towards automated vehicles (AVs) is necessary to more reliably forecast the potential impacts of AVs on transportation system. The road to fully automated driving systems pass through partially automated driving systems. This study contributes by simultaneously analyzing consumer affinity towards partially (Level 3/4 automation) connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and fully AVs (FAVs) (Level 5 automation), and how it relates to sustainable travel behavior, user valuation of different vehicle attributes, (electric) vehicle ownership, and safety concerns. Unique data for over 3500 households from the 2017 California Vehicle Survey are harnessed. With an on-average positive correlation between consumer affinity towards partially CAVs and FAVs (Kendall’s τb of 0.506), significant contrasts are also observed. Compared to around 64\% of the households with positive affinity towards partially CAVs, only 35\% were willing to consider buying a FAV in future. Around 30\% of the households had negative affinity for FAVs but positive affinity for partially CAVs. A comprehensive simulation-assisted joint bivariate ordered discrete outcome modeling framework is used, considering preference heterogeneity at different geographic/ecological levels, from the region to household level, and further within and across the choices for partially CAVs and FAVs. Participation in carshare, rideshare programs, and more transit trips per member were independently associated with a greater affinity towards partially CAVs and FAVs. Ownership of a plug-in electric vehicle was associated with a 19.9\% and 9.6\% increase in the likelihood of highest affinity levels towards partially CAVs and FAVs, respectively. Some evidence is found that consumers may possibly use shared AVs, but not necessarily in combination with ride sharing. Simultaneous correlations between affinity towards partially CAVs and FAVs and most valued vehicle attributes, safety concerns, and sociodemographic factors are quantified. Methodologically, the results underscore the importance of considering preference heterogeneity at different geographic/ecological levels. Captured through random parameters, the associations of several factors with consumer affinity towards partially CAVs and FAVs varied in magnitude and direction. In addition, statistically significant interactive effects (opposite and counterbalancing) of the latent unobserved factors underlying several random parameters were observed. The presence of multilayered preference heterogeneity highlights the personalized and complex nature of behavioral phenomenon underlying user acceptance of AVs. By reflecting the users’ preferences towards CAVs and FAVs and characterizing the taste/preference heterogeneity at multiple levels, the findings can be integrated in larger travel forecasting models to more accurately predict the future-use and ownership patterns of CAVs and FAVs by various sociodemographic cohorts.}

However, capacity has not always matched this increased demand. As such, passengers experience long waiting times and are denied boarding during the peak hours. Crowded platforms and the subsequent customer dissatisfaction and safety issues have become a serious concern. The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically reduced passengers’ willingness to board crowded trains, causing a surge in demand for real-time crowding information. In this paper, we propose a real-time predictive decision support platform which addresses both, operations control and customer information needs. The system provides crowding predictions on trains and platforms, communicates this information to passengers, and takes into account their response to it. It is demonstrated through a case study that providing predictive information to passengers can potentially reduce denied boarding and lead to better utilization of train capacity.}

The travel demand of passengers is involved in the energy-efficient train timetabling problem via service patterns, i.e., different operation headways are used in peak and off-peak hours to satisfy the passenger demand. A mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation is presented to optimize train timetables and circulation plans of rolling stocks simultaneously with the aim of minimizing the headway deviations relating to service patterns, the headway variations among neighboring train services, the needed depot movements for rolling stocks, and the overall energy consumption. To increase the regularity (i.e., the consistency of operation level selections of train services) of train timetables and to improve the computational efficiency, two extensions of the energy-efficient timetabling formulation are proposed, i.e. the energy-efficient train timetabling models with pre-fixed selections and optimal identical (or consistent) selections of the operation levels. The proposed MINLP formulations are transformed into mixed integer linear programming formulations, which could be effectively solved, e.g., by Cplex and Gurobi solvers. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed models, we perform computational experiments based on the real-world data of the Beijing Yizhuang line. The numerical results illustrate that the energy consumption of the daily train timetable obtained by the proposed energy-efficient train timetabling model with flexible selection of operation levels is reduced by 9.90\% when compared with that of the train timetables without operation level selections. Moreover, the energy savings of the energy-efficient train timetables with optimal identical selection and pre-fixed selection of operation levels are 7.67\% and 5.75\%, respectively. However, the computation time of the energy-efficient train timetabling models with operation level selections is significantly longer than that without operation level selections.}

Additionally, the last two techniques converge to solutions of minimum flight length. Through parallelization on graphical processing units the required computational times are reduced substantially to become compatible with near real-time operation. The proposed methods are tested considering a kinematic model of an aircraft flying between two waypoints at constant flight level and airspeed; the test scenario is based on a realistic weather forecast and assumed to be described by an ensemble of equally likely members. Lastly, the influence of the number of scenarios, safety margin and iterations on the results is analyzed. Results show that the SB-RRTs are able to find safe and, in two of the algorithms, close-to-optimum solutions.}

We find that the most effective way to prevent the coronavirus from spreading quickly and extensively is to control the routes linked to the epicenter at the beginning of the pandemic. But if the virus has been widely spread, setting restrictions on hub cities would be much more efficient than imposing the same travel ban across the whole country.

Meanwhile, EV incentive policies, adjusted adaptively as a response to EV market growth, will perturb the mixed traffic pattern periodically. Such periodic perturbation will cause mixed traffic to evolve from disequilibrium to a new equilibrium. This equilibration is theoretically indeterminate due to the non-uniqueness of mixed traffic equilibria and the dynamic interaction between operational policy and underlying mixed traffic. The non-unique mixed-traffic equilibrium in the previous period influences the traffic stationary state and traffic evolution trajectory in the next period, which is also non-unique. Thereby, the indeterminacy in the equilibration process affects the long-term mixed traffic performance that should be factored into the period-to-period adjustment of EV incentive policies. This effect calls for the study of mixed traffic equilibration as a theoretical foundation for long-term policymaking, which has not received significant attention. This paper explores the properties of mixed traffic equilibria and proposes a mixed traffic evolution model considering time-varying EV penetration. The mixed traffic evolution model is then integrated into a control framework to support the period-to-period adjustment of EV-promoting tolling policy. Numerical examples illustrate the effects of non-unique mixed traffic equilibria and period-to-period toll adjustment schemes on long-term mixed traffic performance.}

A widely adopted matching strategy is to accumulate a batch of potential passenger-driver matches and solve bipartite matching problems repeatedly. The efficiency of matching can be improved substantially if the matching is delayed by adaptively adjusting the matching time interval. The optimal delayed matching is subject to the trade-off between the delay penalty and the reduced wait cost and is dependent on the system’s supply and demand states. Searching for the optimal delayed matching policy is challenging, as the current policy is compounded with past actions. To this end, we tailor a family of reinforcement learning-based methods to overcome the curse of dimensionality and sparse reward issues. In addition, this work provides a solution to spatial partitioning balance between the state representation error and the optimality gap of asynchronous matching. Lastly, we examine the proposed methods with real-world taxi trajectory data and garner managerial insights into the general delayed matching policies.

Firstly, a 3D voxel jump point search (JPS) based path planning model is developed to generate the static collision-free reference path. With the optimization, the reference path is then de-diagonalized, reconstructed, and smoothed to obtain the desired path. Subsequently, a local collision resolution method is proposed to avoid near mid-air collision of the dynamic threats. The method is based on the Markov decision process (MDP) to implement real-time dynamic collision avoidance. Simulations are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed model.

abstract = {Electric bus networks are steadily gaining ground as the prominent option for urban public transport. However, in contrast to conventional transit systems operated by diesel buses, electric bus networks are particularly vulnerable with respect to energy supply, both in terms of power level availability and the unobstructed access to charging points. Indeed, power fluctuations can prevent buses from adequately recharging at designated points, affecting extended areas of operation. Similarly, queue formation at terminal stops can lead to poor schedule adherence and excessive delays. In this context, this study addresses research gaps by presenting a realistic and flexible design framework for fully electric public transport networks, tackling both the route network and the charging infrastructure design. To handle the uncertainty associated with power supply, Robust Optimization (RO) is employed for solving the charging infrastructure location problem while maintaining computational tractability. Queuing delays due to charging are also modeled and minimized. To address the integrated design of route networks and wireless chargers, RO is coupled with Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization within a bi-level methodological framework. Different scenarios for power supply variability are considered. Results show that depending on policy priority, the cost of robustness significantly changes.}

abstract = {Ridesharing (RS) has been modeled as a specific multimodal equilibrium where solo and RS vehicles have different travel cost structures. An extended network structure that incorporates three types of traffic flows (i.e., solo drivers, RS drivers, and RS riders) has been useful in RS related network design problems and policy making. However, the extended network structure did not model the matching cost between drivers and riders at each node explicitly, leading to unreasonable or undesirable phenomena. For instance, RS drivers may drop off passengers at one node, proceed to the next link, and then pick up passengers again. This frequent pick-up and drop-off phenomenon needs to be fixed before any efficient policies can be proposed. This paper aims to develop a two-layer extended network that allows to model nodal cost whenever a pickup or a drop-off happens. Search friction of drivers and waiting time of riders will be formulated as well. Accordingly, bi-level network design problems are formulated for congestion tolling and platform pricing. For congestion tolling, we apply a differential toll scheme and analyze its impact on optimal tolls. For platform pricing, we propose two objectives: maximization of social welfare and maximization of the platform revenue, and compare their impact on system performances. Numerical examples are then performed for congestion tolling and platform pricing on the Braess network and the Sioux Falls network, respectively.}

These sources usually offer valuable significant population penetration rates but may also suffer from important temporal sparsity. Data generated by user activity, such as social networks or mobile phone data, especially fit this description. Although this temporal sparsity might prevent estimating individual travel speeds, we state that such low-frequency positioning data enable estimating the average urban traffic speed dynamics when considering an adequate network partitioning. In this sense, this article proposes a new method, based on the division of the urban area of a given city into regions and on the analysis of a limited set of basic characteristics of individual vehicle trips, such as the regional path. Our solution first involves estimating robust travel times from travelers sharing similar trip features and then jointly analyzing these travel times to deduce the underlying regional traffic speeds, using regression analysis. We apply this methodology on a set of trips derived from a large GPS dataset of vehicle tracks covering the city of Lyon. These data are purposely downsampled to reduce the sampling rate and reproduce bias and temporal features that are proper to sparser but larger-scale, mobility data sources dependent on user’s communication activities. Controlling the data downsampling process allows us to evaluate the impacts of the progressive information loss on the speed estimation, while the raw GPS data provide the ground truth speed reference against which to compare our results. Provided that the amount of observed individual trips is sufficient, the analysis returns satisfying speed estimation results, both at low and high downsampling levels. Thus, we successfully demonstrate that it is possible to estimate zonal traffic speeds from degraded trip data without evaluating individual travel speeds.}

The first component – taxi zone ridehailing demand - is analyzed adopting a negative binomial count model. The second component - share of traditional and TNC services demand - is analyzed using a multinomial fractional split model. The two model components are stitched together in a joint framework that allows for the influence of repeated observations as well as for the presence of common unobserved factors affecting the two components. The model estimation considered a comprehensive set of independent variables including transportation infrastructure variables, land use and built environment variables, weather attributes, and temporal attributes. Several performance measures were generated using the joint model for estimation and validation datasets. A prediction exercise is conducted to illustrate how the proposed model system can be utilized for predicting future ridehailing trends. Finally, an elasticity exercise is conducted to estimate the influence of independent variables on the ridehailing market.}

Although ideal observing conditions and behavioral assumptions are often indispensable for estimation, day-to-day traffic recurrences and variations are seldom utilized to improve the estimation performance. In this paper, we propose a new method to recover day-to-day dynamic OD flows using both connected vehicle (CV) trajectories and automatic vehicle identification (AVI) observations. The method involves two modules: the first module provides reliable prior OD flows given limited observations, while the second module seeks the optimal estimates based on the prior OD flows. In the first module, linear projection is extended to consider temporal and spatial variation of the CV penetration rate, and non-negative Tucker decomposition (NTD) is adopted to address the data sparsity issue caused by the low CV penetration rate. In the second module, a self-supervised learning model called the latency-constrained autoencoder (LCAE) is established to search for the optimal OD flows according to the priors with given robust latent features. To avoid local minima and ensure consistency between estimates, a novel algorithm called adaptive sub-sample correction (ASC) is proposed and integrated into the optimization process of LCAE, which can iteratively correct the most inconsistent samples based on the day-to-day traffic flow characteristics. The proposed method is examined on an empirical urban arterial network, a calibrated simulation network, and a synthetic large-scale grid network. Our results indicated that the proposed method requires very few AVI detectors and CV trajectories to achieve competitive estimation performance against two benchmark models. Furthermore, general robustness to several factors with respect to observing conditions and data quality was investigated, and satisfactory scalability was also demonstrated in terms of both estimation accuracy and computational cost.}

abstract = {The low energy density of batteries and the long recharging times constitute a significant barrier for electrification of public transportation (PT) systems since electric buses (EB) require too heavy and expensive batteries to achieve the operational availability of their combustion engine counterparts. New recharging technologies such as fast chargers and dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) emerge as promising solutions to overcome these challenges. Optimizing the bus fleet composition and the schedules is essential to take advantage of these emerging technologies and achieve electrification of PT in a cost-efficient way. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an integer (binary) programming formulation to find the optimal electric bus fleet composition and scheduling that minimizes the total procurement cost of the buses and the operating cost of the schedules. A column generation (CG) approach is devised to obtain provably high-quality solutions, for large problem instances. The success of the approach is due to a novel dynamic programming algorithm we develop to solve the generalized resource-constrained shortest path problem that needs to be solved in each CG iteration to find out new schedules to include in the model. Extensive computational studies on large real-world PT networks attest to the efficacy of the suggested methodology and reveal valuable managerial insights from a system-wide perspective.}

abstract = {With an increased focus on minimising traffic externalities in metropolitan areas, a growing interest in environmentally friendly mobility systems has emerged, such as electric car-sharing systems. However, increasing demand and larger service areas often make it difficult to keep cars available where and when customers need them. This problem can be alleviated by predicting for how long cars stay vacant at given pick-up/drop-off locations. To maximise their usage, shared fleet operators relocate the cars to more desired locations. In this paper, we tackle the problem of predicting time to pick-up for shared cars in a probabilistic way by applying time-to-event modelling through survival analysis. Both statistical and machine learning approaches to survival regression are investigated. In addition, we propose the use of Gaussian copulas in order to model the correlation among vacant vehicles and to obtain more refined event-based predictions. First, an exploratory analysis is done to investigate the effect of various features on car vacancy time, which can provide significant insights into vacancy times and their influencing factors. Second, the Cox proportional hazards model (CPH), a linear survival model, is compared to DeepSurv, a neural-network-based survival model. To predict survival times, a two-step approach is formulated: in the upper level, a classification model is used to classify cars based on vacancy time duration and, in the lower level, time-to-event modelling is applied to each class using independent survival analysis models. Our empirical results using data from Copenhagen demonstrate that the DeepSurv model leads to a stronger fit compared to CPH. Moreover, we were able to verify that the proposed two-step approach can result in an improvement of over 15\% in performance compared to a standard one-step approach. Lastly, we demonstrate the benefits of survival models for relocation optimisation.}

Travelers choose to use either the transit mode or the driving mode (as well as travel paths in the corresponding modal network) that minimizes their equilibrium travel cost. In addition, transit routes involve dedicated bus lanes that occupy part of the city streets and affect the capacity reserved for private cars. Hence, roadway congestion depends on the transit route design, and its dynamic evolution is described by regional macroscopic fundamental diagrams. The proposed modeling framework consists of two parts: a bus network optimization module based on continuum approximation that produces optimal headways and local route spacing, and a dynamic aggregated network model that determines route choice, mode split, and user equilibrium conditions. An iterative solution algorithm is developed to solve the integrated model. Numerical experiments are used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed modeling framework, and to conduct a careful analysis on the influence of the demand pattern on the transit network design, roadway congestion, and the overall system performance.}

Automated valet parking (AVP) system based on automated guided vehicles (AGVs) can relieve human from parking and improve efficiency to a certain extent due to their fully automatic control and operation. However, with the expansion of the scale of the whole parking lot, the current AGV based AVP system is facing the disadvantage of long-time queue congestion and even deadlock. In this paper, we systematically consider the traffic congestion faced by the AGV based AVP system and introduce a bi-level cooperative operation approach. The global cooperative parking space allocation is considered in the upper-level, and the cooperative driving of multiple AGVs in the conflict zone is resolved in the lower-level. The upper-level problem is formulated as a Markov decision process, and a global cooperative allocation method is obtained by using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). In the lower-level, with the modified planning based cooperative driving method, multiple AGVs can drive efficiently without collision and deadlock in the conflict zone. Experiment results show that the proposed cooperative operation approach can significantly alleviate the congestion problem in the AGV based parking lot and improve the AVP system’s efficiency.}

abstract = {The land-use pattern for many cities is a central business district surrounded by sprawling suburbs. This pattern can lead to an inefficient and congestion-prone transportation system due to a reliance on automobiles. This is because high-capacity transit is inefficient in low-density areas where insufficient travelers can access transit. This also poses an equity concern as the monetary cost of faster and more expensive travel disproportionately burdens low income travelers, especially when fixed congestion pricing is imposed. This paper presents a deterministic approximation of a discrete choice model for mixed access and mainline transportation modes, meaning that travelers may use different modes to access a mainline system, such as transit. The purpose is to provide a tractable computationally efficient model to address the first/last mile problem using a system-wide pricing policy that can account for heterogeneous values of time; a problem that is difficult to solve efficiently using a stochastic model. The model is structured for a catchment area around a central access point for a mainline mode, approximating choice by comparing modal utility costs. The underlying utility model accommodates both fixed prices (e.g., parking, fixed tolls, and fares) and distance-based unit prices (e.g. taxi fare, bike-share, and distance tolls) that may be set in a coordinated way with respect to value of time. Using numerical analysis to assess accuracy, the deterministic model achieved results within 3\% of a stochastic logit-based model, and within 7\% of measured values. The optimization of prices using the final model achieved a 22\% reduction in generalized travel time and a 30\% improvement in the Gini inequity measure from 0.2 to 0.14.}

abstract = {Accurate forecasting of passenger flow (i.e., ridership) is critical to the operation of urban metro systems. Previous studies mainly model passenger flow as time series by aggregating individual trips and then perform forecasting based on the values in the past several steps. However, this approach essentially overlooks the fact that passenger flow consists of trips from each individual traveler. For example, a traveler’s work trip in the morning can help predict his/her home trip in the evening, while this causal structure cannot be explicitly encoded in standard time series models. In this paper, we propose a new forecasting framework for boarding flow by incorporating the generative mechanism into standard time series models and leveraging the strong regularity rooted in travel behavior. In doing so, we introduce returning flow from previous alighting trips as a new covariate, which captures the causal structure and long-range dependencies in passenger flow data based on travel behavior. We develop the return probability parallelogram (RPP) to summarize the causal relationships and estimate the return flow. The proposed framework is evaluated using real-world passenger flow data, and the results confirm that the returning flow—a single covariate—can substantially and consistently improve various forecasting tasks, including one-step ahead forecasting, multi-step ahead forecasting, and forecasting under special events. And the proposed method is more effective for business-type stations with most passengers come and return within the same day. This study can be extended to other modes of transport, and it also sheds new light on general demand time series forecasting problems, in which causal structure and long-range dependencies are generated by the user behavior.}

Despite the multi-agent nature of road user interactions, the majority of previous studies modeled their interactions as a single-agent modeling framework, i.e., considering the other interaction agents as part of the passive environment. However, this assumption is unrealistic and could limit the model's accuracy and transferability in non-stationary road user environments. This study proposes a novel Multi-Agent Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning approach (MA-AIRL) to model and simulate road user interactions at shared space facilities. Unlike the traditional game-theoretic framework that models multi-agent systems as a single time-step payoff, the proposed approach is based on Markov Games (MG) which models road users' sequential decisions concurrently. Moreover, the proposed model can handle bounded rationality agents, e.g., limited information access, through the implementation of the Logistic Stochastic Best Response Equilibrium (LSBRE) solution concept. The proposed algorithm recovers road users' multi-agent reward functions using adversarial deep neural network discriminators and estimates their optimal policies using Multi-agent Actor-Critic with Kronecker factors (MACK) deep reinforcement learning. Data from three shared space locations in Vancouver, BC and New York City, New York are used in this study. The model's performance is compared to a baseline single-agent Gaussian Process Inverse Reinforcement Learning (GPIRL). The results show that the multi-agent modeling framework led to a significantly more accurate prediction of road users’ behaviour and their evasive action mechanisms. Moreover, the recovered reward functions based on the single-agent modeling approach failed to capture the equilibrium solution concept similar to the multi-agent approach.}

The akypooling aids airlines to match their requirements for the two ULD sharing operations. However, such matching is not always successful. The matching success rate naturally affects skypooling performance and generates a gap between the expected and available numbers of ULDs for the two ULD sharing operations. We design two achievement rates for ULD sharing operations, which represent the likelihood of meeting ULD dispatch requirements in actual operations, as well as devising. We develop a novel ULD sharing model and a solution algorithm to handle the problem. The model is developed by combining the network technique utilized in Operations Research with the binomial distribution utilized in Statistics. The solution algorithm comprises a three-stage iterative evolutionary process. We obtain that the carrier decrease the number of ULDs utilized each week by 7\% by the two ULD sharing operations. Different instances exemplifying optimistic, normal, and pessimistic situations are examined to understand the ultimate implications and applications of the new technique for airline operations.}

The significant increment of machine intelligence poses a new challenge to the community, which is the collaboration between human drivers and vehicle autonomy. As vehicle autonomy is gaining more control authority, the roles that human drivers can play in the future need to be further clarified. In this study, literature review and perspectives on the human behaviors and cognition (HBC) for ADVs toward human-autonomy (H-A) collaboration are proposed. First, the H-A collaboration basics and key factors are reviewed. Then, the HBC issues in driver behavior modeling and understanding are discussed. Specifically, two key factors are reviewed, which are human trust and situation awareness (SA). Next, HBC in two H-A collaboration-enabled vehicle control methods, namely, shared control and take-over control, are analyzed. It is shown that the human-centered collaboration strategy that integrates driver states will largely increase the acceptance of the ADVs. Then, the HBC issues in the design of human-machine-interface (HMI) for future autonomous and collaboration-enabled ADVs are discussed. Last, challenges and future works for H-A collaboration on ADVs are analyzed to contribute to the development of understandable, trustable, and acceptable ADVs.}

abstract = {Using full-lane 3D pavement data, this paper proposes an automated and systematic approach to efficient measurement of pavement faulting occurring at transverse joints. First, a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) is proposed in the paper to detect pavement joints. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FCN outperforms FCN-VGG16 and U-Net in terms of detection accuracy, but results in a slower processing speed due to the increased number of hidden layers. Compared with the 3D Shadow Modeling, the proposed FCN shows significant improvements in terms of both accuracy and time efficiency. The precision, recall and F-measure achieved by the proposed FCN on 1130 testing images are 92.64\%, 97.14\% and 94.83\% respectively. Based on detection outputs of the proposed FCN, this paper applies Hough Transform only at orientations feasible for transverse joints. Such a strategy helps retain transverse joints for analysis, and eliminate unneeded longitudinal joints. Finally, this paper proposes a practical method to conduct comprehensive faulting measurements along the entire detected transverse joint, while field measurements today are generally on limited spots on the joint. Meaningful statistical indicators are also recommended in the paper to describe the general faulting condition along a transverse joint. The field test on a jointed concrete pavement reveals that the proposed automated approach is comparable in accuracy with manual investigation. Measurement errors at most testing locations are within ± 2 mm, and the average absolute error with respect to all testing locations is 1.2 mm. Compared with manual means or automated methods using only a few longitudinal profiles, the proposed automation of faulting survey achieves the following improvements: detecting transverse joints to the full-lane width through full-lane 3D pavement data as well as deep learning technology, and measuring faulting values along the entire transverse joint in a more efficient and more complete manner.}

abstract = {The vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications enable a wide range of new applications, which bring prominent benefits to the transportation system. However, malicious attackers can potentially launch falsified data attacks against V2I applications to jeopardize the traffic operation. To ensure the benefits brought by the V2I applications, it is critical to protect the applications from those cyber-attacks. However, existing literature on the defense solution that protects the V2I applications is very limited. This paper aims to fill this research gap by proposing a data-driven method to identify falsified trajectories generated by compromised connected vehicles (CVs). A trajectory embedding model, inspired by the word embedding model from the natural language processing (NLP) community, is developed. The proposed trajectory embedding model generates vector representations of vehicle trajectories that can be used to compute the similarities between trajectories. The proposed method consists of two steps. In the first step, historical trajectory data are used to train a neural network and obtain the vector representations of trajectories. The second step computes a distance matrix between each pair of trajectories and identifies falsified trajectories using a hierarchical clustering algorithm. Simulation experiments show that the proposed method has a very high detection rate (>97.0\%) under different attack goals with varying CV penetration rates from 100\% to 25\%, while the false alarm rate remains low. It has great potential to be implemented in a wide range of trajectory-based CV applications such as traffic state estimation and traffic signal control, to safeguard the CV system from cyber threats.}

However, due to its high-dimensionality, even if anonymised there still exists the possibility to re-identify the users behind the mobile phone traces. This risk makes its usage outside the telecommunication network incompatible with recent data privacy regulations, hampering its adoption in transportation-related applications. To address this issue, we propose a framework designed only with user-aggregated mobile phone data to synthesise realistic daily individual mobility — Digital Twin Travellers. We explore different strategies built around modified Markov models and an adaption of the Rejection Sampling algorithm to recreate realistic daily schedules and locations. We also define a one-day mobility population score to measure the similarity between the population of generated agents and the real mobile phone user population. Ultimately, we show how with a series of histograms provided by the telecommunication service provider (TSP) it is possible and plausible to disaggregate them into new synthetic and useful individual-level information, building in this way a big data travel demand framework that is designed in accordance with current data privacy regulations.}

This paper investigates whether reliable demand data can be extracted from mining social network (Twitter) content and using the resulting information to inform the design of commercially viable bus routes from peri-urban areas of Barcelona to a large music event (Canet Rock). Using data from relevant Twitter users, a Twitter influence score was established for each of the 947 municipalities in the Barcelona Region, providing a spatially distributed picture of the demand to attend the event, prior to event ticket purchase. This was used as the basis for planning and delivering 11 new commercially viable event bus routes transporting over 450 additional passengers from peri-urban and more rural areas in the Barcelona Region. This paper demonstrates that the innovation of information mining from Social Networks can provide better comprehension of the demand to support Mobility Management Planning for large events and can radically improve the ability of bus services to serve demand from peri-urban and rural areas.}

In an interurban context, SAV systems may potentially contribute to significantly improve the availability and quality of public transport. In this paper, we propose a flow-based integer programming approach to design and assess the financial viability of a SAV interurban system. An integer programming model, based on profit maximization and allowing vehicle pooling, was developed to optimize the fleet size and vehicle movements of a typical working day. This model and its optimal results were the basis for assessing the financial viability of an interurban transport network in the central area of Portugal. Different levels of demand were tested and three different fleet compositions were considered: cars, minibuses, and a mixed fleet of both. The results showed that a mixed fleet of vehicles is the best option for profit maximization. The optimal share of each vehicle type, in this fleet composition, asymptotically converges to approximately 1/3 of cars and 2/3 of minibuses, as demand increases. The introduction of a SAV system in such a region for interurban trips can replace up to 18 private vehicles per SAV vehicle, and should be done with sequential expansions to guarantee a profit at the different stages. The break-even point, for the conditions of the case study, is between 1.5 and 2 passengers per vehicle, for a fleet of cars, and between 4 and 5 passengers per vehicle, for a fleet of minibuses.}

abstract = {Signal priority and exclusive bus lanes are common measures used to promote bus travel at signalized intersections. However, these bus priority measures create significant damage to the car traffic especially at intersections with heavy bus and car traffic. For this reason, bus priority is not welcome at busy intersections. We examine a novel intersection approach design that can solve the above dilemma. The design integrates a bus lane, bus signal priority, and a midblock pre-signal for sorting different car traffic streams in tandem in the approach. Car capacity gains from the use of pre-signal can potentially recover the car capacity lost to bus lane and signal priority schemes. This paper first presents how the pre-signal and main signal can be timed to realize bus signal priority, and where the pre-signal should be placed. Models are then formulated for estimating the expected bus delay and car capacity under the integrated design. They are compared against three alternative designs, including a conventional intersection design without bus priority or pre-signal. Numerical results unveil that the integrated design produces not only significant bus delay savings, but also higher car capacities in most instances. Even greater car capacity gains are observed with higher bus frequencies. Moreover, the benefits are fairly robust when real-world operating features, such as bus arrival time prediction error, are considered. Thus, the integrated design can potentially promote both bus and car traffic at congested intersections.}

A formal analysis shows that the effectiveness of the proposed shared controller does not depend on the parameters of the human driver’s model, which is an important property in the implementation of the shared controller, since these parameters are difficult to measure, and vary from one human driver to another and from one driving situation to another. In addition, the proposed control law is robust: the stop-and-go wave can be dampened and there is no collisions among vehicles even if there is noise on the information each vehicle receives from the higher level traffic control center. A comparison between performances of the vehicles with and without the proposed control scheme demonstrates the robustness and the effectiveness of the shared control solution.}

However, there is limited fast-charging infrastructure in most parts of the world to support EV travel, especially long-distance trips. The goal of this study is to develop a stochastic dynamic simulation modeling framework of a regional system of EV fast-charging stations for real-time management and strategic planning (i.e., capacity allocation) purposes. To model EV user behavior, specifically fast-charging station choices, the framework incorporates a multinomial logit station choice model that considers station charging prices, expected wait times, and detour distances. To capture the dynamics of supply and demand at each EV fast-charging station, the framework incorporates a multi-server queueing model in the simulation. The study assumes that multiple fast-charging stations are managed by a single entity (public or private) and that the demand for these stations are interrelated (through the station choice model). To manage the system of stations, this study proposes and tests dynamic demand-responsive price adjustment (DDRPA) schemes based on station queue lengths. The study applies the modeling framework to a system of EV fast-charging stations in Southern California. The computational results indicate that DDRPA strategies are an effective mechanism to balance charging demand across fast-charging stations. Specifically, compared to the no DDRPA scheme case, the quadratic DDRPA scheme reduces average wait time by 26\%, increases charging station revenue (and user costs) by 5.8\%, while, most importantly, increasing social welfare by 2.7\% in the base scenario. Moreover, the study also illustrates that the modeling framework can evaluate the allocation of EV fast-charging station capacity, to identify stations that require additional chargers and areas that would benefit from additional fast-charging stations.}

We derive the equilibrium of the risk-averse travelers with heterogeneous Values of Time (VOTs) under various information regimes. We find that information regarding the risky road conditions would not necessarily improve the expected system travel time. When there is no toll, free information surprisingly makes congestion worse. When information is not free, congestion may be reduced if both toll and information are properly priced. We also examine the distributional effects of information provision across travelers with different VOTs. Travelers with low VOTs who do not use information are not affected by the price of information. Travelers with intermediate VOTs always benefit from information provision regardless of its price. Finally, travelers with high VOTs are better off when the information price exceeds a threshold.}

Despite companies continually providing rewards to attract customers, factors that contribute to customer churn are not well-understood in the existing literature. This study analyzed one-year transaction data of a one-way carsharing program and applied an extended Cox proportional hazards model to examine these effects. Our results show that: (1) A customer’s retention probability decreased over time with a decelerating rate. (2) Customers were less likely to churn when their frequently-visited shared-car stations were located in neighborhoods with low access to transit or in areas with colleges, railway hubs, or airports. (3) Elderly and male customers had a lower likelihood of churning. (4) The number of coupons was negatively associated with the likelihood of customer churn. (5) The effect of coupons generally increased at first and then decreased after the 130th day. These findings contribute to coupon design and the location choice of shared-car stations. Specifically, we suggest that large-denomination coupons should be split into multiple small-denomination coupons. We encourage companies to locate stations in areas with poor transit access. Meanwhile, coupon issuing strategies can be redeveloped. Offering more coupons to new customers can help maximize the profits of service providers. However, such a strategy is debatable because it invades personal privacy and is unfair for existing loyal customers.}

However, due to the complex mathematical structure of the trip-based models, deriving analytical properties of the dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) of departure time choice with the trip-based models is still a challenge. This paper investigates the DUE problem of departure time choice in an isotropic urban network with identical travelers. Traffic dynamics is captured by the basic trip-based model using a speed-MFD that maps the traffic accumulation to the space-mean speed of the network. Necessary conditions for dynamic user equilibrium with and without inflow capacity constraint are derived, respectively. Under dynamic user equilibrium condition, no traveler can reduce her/his travel cost by changing the departure time. The analysis reveals the significant difference between the basic trip-based model and the conventional MFD models regarding the information support involved in the departure time choice. The derivation does not rely on some common assumptions in the literature such as linear travel cost function, no late arrivals, or linear speed-MFD. The numerical example indicates that the inflow capacity constraint can help prevent two peaks in the departure profile and the vehicle accumulation.}

We create a set of anticipation factors in a stochastic PM behaviour model to tackle sensitivities to both space headway and relative speed against intra- and inter-modes. The proposed behaviour model involves a deterministic and a stochastic force. In the deterministic force, the anticipation factors are used in an optimal velocity model and a full velocity difference model. In the stochastic force, the Langevin equation is used to capture PMs’ stochastic characteristics against movements of other PMs, pedestrians, and bicycles, and the effect of lateral interactions. We carried out real-world circular experiments of mixed sustainable modes to verify the performance of the proposed models. Five models’ performances are compared under four different traffic conditions, including bike-mixed, pedestrian-mixed, low-speed, and high-speed conditions. We confirmed that newly created anticipation factors play a significant role in all models under all conditions to partially influence the following PM devices’ behaviour from the leading two different sustainable modes. The validation results illustrate the excellence of the proposed method. Consequently, behavioural uncertainty is well captured by the stochastic PM devices following models under all traffic conditions, although it requires more parameters than the deterministic PM behavioural models. The proposed method paves the way for the stochastic CF model’s applicability to describe PM devices’ behavioural dynamics under mixed traffic conditions using anticipation factors. Besides, it lays the foundation stone of PM devices’ dynamics in a shared lane to construct effective regulations and safety standards.}

UAM has shown a promising prospect in mitigating ground congestion and providing people with an alternative mobility option.

Among all solutions, cooperative pursuit using a team of UAVs is an effective countermeasure for unauthorized UAVs in urban airspace. In this paper, we model cooperative pursuit as a pursuit-evasion game problem (PEG) and propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) based approach to solve the problem efficiently. The proposed approach incorporates novel cellular-enabled parameter sharing and curriculum learning schemes to enhance the capability of pursuer UAVs in capturing faster unauthorized UAVs in urban airspace. Extensive experiments have been conducted using simulated urban airspace in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate that by incorporating the parameter sharing scheme, the proposed methods provide much higher capturing rates in a shorter time. Such superiority is more evident when communication constraints are more stringent and/or unauthorized UAVs are faster.}

The extra floating trips of vacant AVs have adverse impacts on traffic congestion and the parking demand–supply imbalance may still exist when they are not distributed optimally. This paper presents a centralized parking dispatch approach to optimize the distribution of floating AVs and provide regional route guidance. We apply the concept of macroscopic fundamental diagram to represent the evolution of traffic conditions, cruising-for-parking, and dispatched AVs in a congested multi-region network. A model predictive control is suggested to optimize the control inputs. Numerical experiments in a four-region network demonstrate that the proposed parking dispatch and regional route guidance of AVs are effective in reducing intense cruising-for-parking traffic, and the integration of both has the best control performance by regulating the network towards under-saturated conditions. The performance of the proposed schemes is evaluated via simulations with noise in measurement errors and compliance rate prediction. Results show substantial improvements in terms of total time spent, even for low levels of AV market penetration or AV compliance rate to parking dispatch and route guidance.}

Using Bluetooth vehicle trajectory data from Brisbane, Australia, we compare the prediction performance of the proposed models with several existing approaches including hidden Markov model and other LSTM-based models. The results show that the proposed models produce higher prediction accuracy for both location and time prediction tasks, with the sequential LSTM yielding the best performance. Compared to the conventional next location prediction problem, which considers location sequences only without travel time consideration, the study finds that jointly modelling location and travel time sequences actually improves the next location prediction performance itself, potentially because travel time observations capture the information on traffic conditions in the network, which may affect drivers’ location choices. We demonstrate an application of the proposed models in network traffic management, where important locations can be identified to mitigate congestion in a hot-spot by predicting where vehicles come from and go next in an urban road network.}

We consider domain dynamics (e.g.signalling system, kinematic equations) and additional components which are modelled as stochastic factors, affecting speed. Those latter model well the trajectories of railway vehicles observed in real life, representing the combined effect of human actions, track variations, resistances, control systems and actions. We propose multiple stochastic process models (i.e.Brownian motion, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, doubly-bounded Cox-Ingersoll-Ross, and doubly mean-reverting Langevin equation) which extend the existing traffic flow theory models for cars towards railway traffic and its specific requirements and constraints. To the best of authors’ knowledge, this paper is the first work which considers stochastic components in order to model mathematically realistic railway traffic dynamics in line with the findings in roadway microscopic traffic behaviour modelling. Closed expressions of relevant characteristics for some stochastic process models have been derived. The behavior of the system has been simulated to derive macroscopic performance indicators and later compared with a deterministic model performance as a benchmark. The models can be useful to estimate the benefits introduced by automation in railways, including Automated Train Operation (ATO).}

abstract = {Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are rapidly gaining popularity in transportation research in general and travel demand analysis in particular. While ANNs typically outperform conventional methods in terms of predictive performance, they suffer from limited explainability. That is, it is very difficult to assess whether or not particular predictions made by an ANN are based on intuitively reasonable relationships embedded in the model. As a result, it is difficult for analysts to gain trust in ANNs. In this paper, we show that often-used approaches using perturbation (sensitivity analysis) are ill-suited for gaining an understanding of the inner workings of ANNs. Subsequently, and this is the main contribution of this paper, we introduce to the domain of transportation an alternative method, inspired by recent progress in the field of computer vision. This method is based on a re-conceptualisation of the idea of ‘heat maps’ to explain the predictions of a trained ANN. To create a heat map, a prediction of an ANN is propagated backward in the ANN towards the input variables, using a technique called Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). The resulting heat map shows the contribution of each input value –for example the travel time of a certain mode– to a given travel mode choice prediction. By doing this, the LRP-based heat map reveals the rationale behind the prediction in a way that is understandable to human analysts. If the rationale makes sense to the analyst, the trust in the prediction, and, by extension, in the trained ANN as a whole, will increase. If the rationale does not make sense, the analyst may choose to adapt or re-train the ANN or decide not to use it at all. We show that by reconceptualising the LRP methodology towards the choice modelling and travel demand analysis contexts, it can be put to effective use in application domains well beyond the field of computer vision, for which it was originally developed.}

Considering that there may be a long way to achieve 100\% CAV penetration, we discuss in this paper the mixed traffic flow of human driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs on a transportation network. We first propose a double queue (DQ) based mixed traffic flow model to describe the link dynamics as well as the flow transitions at junctions. Based on this mixed flow model, we develop a dynamic bi-level framework to capture the behavior and interaction of HDVs and CAVs. This results in an optimal control problem with equilibrium constraints (OCPEC), where HDVs’ route choice behavior is modeled at the lower level by the instantaneous dynamic user equilibrium (IDUE) principle and the CAVs’ route choice is modelled by the dynamic system optimal (DSO) principle at the upper level. We show how to discretize the OCPEC to a mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) and discuss its properties and solution techniques. The non-convex and non-smooth properties of the MPEC make it hard to be efficiently solved. To overcome this disadvantage, we develop a decomposition based heuristic model predictive control (HMPC) method by decomposing the original MPEC problem into two separate problems: one IDUE problem for HDVs and one DSO problem for CAVs. The experiment results show that, compared with the scenario that all vehicles are HDVs, the proposed methods can significantly improve the network performance under the mixed traffic flow of HDVs and CAVs.}

Moreover, as collaborations in logistics between several companies become popular, more flexible and extended models must be solved to consider the different needs of the companies. This is of high importance in a new logistics concept, the Physical Internet, which is expected to considerably improve the way logistics are handled in the current supply chain management. To optimise the aforementioned requirements, a rich vehicle routing problem with pickup and delivery including numerous attributes is modelled and solved. A mathematical formulation is proposed and implemented in CPLEX to solve the problem. Given the complexity of the problem, solving large instances with exact methods is very time-consuming. Therefore, a multi-threaded meta-heuristic based on Simulated Annealing is developed. A set of new operators coupled with a restart strategy and memory are developed to help improve the performance. Computational results on a generated data-set showed that the proposed meta-heuristic is superior to the CPLEX solver in terms of solvability and computational time. The proposed meta-heuristic was also compared with the best-known results by current state-of-the-art methods on a classical benchmark on pickup and delivery problems with time windows (with up to 200 customers). The experimental results showed that the proposed method was able to match the best-known results in many of these large scale instances}

This work aimed to verify the key theoretical findings in the above study with empirical experiments using commercial AVs, e.g., vehicles with adaptive cruise control (ACC) functions. We collect high-resolution trajectory data of multiple commercial AVs following one another in a platoon with different headway settings. Parsimonious linear AV-following models that capture the first-order parameters on safety, mobility, and stability aspects are estimated with the data. The estimation results of the key parameters validate several theoretical predictions predicted by Li (2020). Specifically, it was found that as the time lag setting increases, the corresponding safety buffer decreases, indicating that AV safety could be improved with less pursuit of AV mobility or, conversely, AV mobility improvement may come at a cost of more stringent safety requirements. Also, as the time lag setting increases, AV string stability increases, indicating that stop-and-go traffic potentially could be dampened by compromising AV mobility. With this, one possible explanation to the observed string instability of commercial AV following control (i.e., ACC function) is that automakers may prefer to ensure a relatively short headway (and thus better user experience on vehicle mobility) at a cost of compromising string stability. It was also found that as the time lag increases, the cycle period of traffic oscillations gets longer, and the oscillation amplification gets smaller, which supports the tradeoff between mobility and stability. On the other hand, field experiments revealed issues beyond the predictivity of a simple linear model. That is, vehicle control sensitivity factors vary across different speed and headway settings, and the model estimation results for key parameters are not consistent over different speed ranges. This opens future research needs for investigating nonlinearity and stochasticity in the AV following modeling.}

Industries and government agencies are preparing for the future UAM system and operation. A new ATC (Air Traffic Control) strategy or aircraft separation method that reflects flight characteristics of multicopter VTOL (Vertical Take-off and Landing) aircraft is required. Particularly, approach control around the vertiport is one of the essential issues for the safe and efficient operation of UAM, and strict safety standards are required for service in populated urban areas. In this study, the concept of holding points where multicopter aircraft can hover is introduced, and three scheduling strategies for arriving aircraft are developed and evaluated by comparing the on-time performance (OTP) with hovering time and ground time. BQA (Branch Queuing Approach), SBA (Sequence-based Approach) and, SBAM (sequence-based approach with moving circles) models are proposed and compared. BQA model prioritizes airspace safety by limiting the aircraft’s travel path; SBA model allows the aircraft to move freely within the airspace and prioritizes aircraft’s arrival sequence; and finally, SBAM adds the moving circle concept to the SBA model. For each model, OTP and loss of separation (LOS) risk of the proposed models are found and they are compared by simulations. The simulation result shows that SBA and BQA have similar punctuality performance and BQA model with no LOS risk is the most efficient approach control model for multicopter VTOL aircraft of UAM.}

The proposed model consists of a mesoscopic traffic module to capture the complex interrelations between the freeway mainline’s traffic state and the lane-changing maneuvers triggered by off-ramp queue spillback, and a local signal optimization module to maximize the total benefit for both the freeway and intersection in the vicinity of an interchange. Using the simulation–optimization solution logic, the proposed model will first estimate the off-ramp queue length, produced from the signal module, to assess the resulting impacts on the freeway mainline, and then feed such impacts back to the control objective to iteratively search for the optimal cycle length and phase durations with the genetic algorithm. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed model, this study has conducted a two-stage evaluation, where the first stage uses the extensive field data to confirm the reliability of its freeway queue impact module and the second stage focuses on evaluating the benefits of accounting for the queue impacts on the freeway in design of the off-ramp signal plan under various traffic scenarios. The results from extensive tests have confirmed that the proposed model can effectively minimize the likelihood of causing off-ramp queues to spill back to the freeway mainline, and the failing to incorporate such impacts in design of the off-ramp signal will contribute significantly to the formation of freeway bottlenecks in the interchange area.}

The first stage is an offline planning stage, aiming at constructing a discrete control network in the working environment achieving collision avoidance and meanwhile considering UAV kinetic properties. The second stage is an online planning stage, where a feasible corridor is generated based on the shortest path in the control network, and the obtained route is smoothed by a three-dimensional Dubins curve algorithm; then, a time-optimal trajectory generation algorithm is applied to trace the designed spatial path.

Data were collected from Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto, Japan, which is highly frequented by tourists. We utilized Wi-Fi packet sensors, which avoid the need for mobile applications but provide only spot data. Based on the data, we first discuss the extraction of tourist trip chains and the construction of a simplified time-space network with “stay” and “move” links. The network and link attributes are based on the location of the sensors as well as map data. Recursive Logit (RL) models are then employed to formulate tourists’ route choice behavior. The existence of different kinds of “points of interests” (POIs) is shown to explain route choice as well as the time spent on roads with shops, restaurants and sightseeing spots.}

AVs, especially combined with shared use, may contribute to reduce or solve some of the present most intractable urban problems such as traffic congestion, crashes and wasted use of urban spaces. Given the emerging trend of new mobility options, understanding the decision of people in owning a private human-driven vehicle or private AV versus using a shared AV or joining car sharing would have important indications for policy makers to reduce car ownership in general. Therefore, this paper is devoted to gain insight into individuals’ propensity for purchasing an autonomous vehicle or using shared (autonomous) cars. Based on the data collected using a stated choice experiment, we estimated a random parameter error component model to identify the possible heterogeneity between individuals in the preference and possible correlations between various mobility alternatives. Results show substantial heterogeneity exists among individuals in their preferences. People in general prefer to keep their current car or buy an AV rather than to use shared cars, and shared AVs are more favorable than the traditional car sharing. Regarding the shared AVs, people are not only concerned about the operational costs and hourly rate, but also vehicle availability and access time. Moreover, younger people are more willing to accept these new mobility options.}

It is generally oriented towards transportation efficiency and solved in a sequential way due to the complexity, but ignores the service experiences among equitable passengers and the utilization balance among equal rolling stocks. This paper aims to study the integrated planning for an oversaturated URT line, incorporating the fairness in train scheduling and workload balance in rolling stock circulation that are measured by two defined min–max indexes. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is established to formulate the integrated planning of stop planning, train scheduling and rolling stock circulation, explicitly considering time-dependent origin–destination demand, first-come-first-serve principle and rigid capacity constraints. Due to the model complexity, an iterative searching approach (ISA) is proposed to solve the model, involving adjusting stop patterns, departure times and connections at the depot terminal. The performance of the ISA is evaluated by three cases with different time lengths based on the practical data from No.8 URT line in Guangzhou. The results are compared with the practical plans and the solutions solved by the two-stage approach respectively. It shows that the ISA can not only mitigate unfairness and balance workload, but also improve transportation efficiency. We also investigate the optimization effects and application conditions of different combinations of searching strategies in the ISA. Furthermore, the study on the typical case during peak hours shows more details about the optimization effects and mechanism of the ISA, which can reach a uniform state in both service level and resource utilization.}

Many studies have used machine learning algorithms to analyze patterns in vehicle trajectories to predict location sequences of individual travelers. Unlike the previous studies that used a discriminative modeling approach, this research suggests a generative modeling approach to learn the underlying distributions of urban vehicle trajectory data. A generative model for urban vehicle trajectories can better generalize from training data by learning the underlying distribution of the training data and, thus, produce synthetic vehicle trajectories similar to real vehicle trajectories with limited observations. Synthetic trajectories can provide solutions to data sparsity or data privacy issues in using location data. This research proposes TrajGAIL, a generative adversarial imitation learning framework for the urban vehicle trajectory generation. In TrajGAIL, learning location sequences in observed trajectories is formulated as an imitation learning problem in a partially observable Markov decision process. The model is trained by the generative adversarial framework, which uses the reward function from the adversarial discriminator. The model is tested with both simulation and real-world datasets, and the results show that the proposed model obtained significant performance gains compared to existing models in sequence modeling.}

abstract = {Accurate and explainable short-term traffic forecasting is pivotal for making trustworthy decisions in advanced traffic control and guidance systems. Recently, deep learning approach, as a data-driven alternative to traffic flow model-based data assimilation and prediction methods, has become popular in this domain. Many of these deep learning models show promising predictive performance, but inherently suffer from a lack of interpretability. This difficulty largely originates from the inconsistency between the static input–output mappings encoded in deep neural networks and the dynamic nature of traffic phenomena. Under different traffic conditions, such as freely-flowing versus heavily congested traffic, different mappings are needed to predict the propagation of congestion and the resulting speeds over the network more accurately. In this study, we design a novel variant of the graph attention mechanism. The major innovation of this so-called dynamic graph convolution (DGC) module is that local area-wide graph convolutional kernels are dynamically generated from evolving traffic states to capture real-time spatial dependencies. When traffic conditions change, the spatial correlation encoded by DGC module changes as well. Using the DGC, we propose a multistep traffic forecasting model, the Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (DGCN). Experiments using real freeway data show that the DGCN has a competitive predictive performance compared to other state-of-the-art models. Equally importantly, the prediction process in the DGCN and the trained parameters are indeed explainable. It turns out that the DGCN learns to mimic the upstream–downstream asymmetric information flow of typical road traffic operations. Specifically, there exists a speed-dependent optimal receptive field – which governs what information the DGC kernels assimilate – that is consistent with the back-propagation speed of stop-and-go waves in traffic streams. This implies that the learnt parameters are consistent with traffic flow theory. We believe that this research paves a path to more transparent deep learning models applied for short-term traffic forecasting.}

This article studies a concept which incorporates the situational awareness gained by airport-collaborative decision making into an airline-internal decision support system, such that it integrates all available schedule recovery options during aircraft ground operations. The developed mathematical optimization model is an adaptation of the Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) and incorporates key features from turnaround target time prediction, passenger connection management, tactical stand allocation and ground service vehicle routing into the airline hub control problem. The model is applied in a case study consisting of 20 turnarounds during a morning peak at Frankfurt airport. Schedule recovery performance (resilience) is analyzed for a set of key performance indicators within multiple scenario instances which contain different resource availability and aim at solving various arrival delay situations. Results highlight that a minimization of tactical cost concurrently reduces average departure delay for flight and passengers while recovery performance is substantially affected when some options are not included in the evaluation process. Thus, our concept provides airlines with an optimization approach for constrained airport resources so that total cost and delay resulting from schedule deviations are reduced, which may benefit strategic schedule planning and improve predictability of operations for local collaborators, such as airport, ground handlers and ATM performance.}

First, the concept of state augmentation is revisited to handle violations of the Markovian assumption typically implicit in online applications of the EKF. Second, a method based on graph-coloring is proposed to operationalize the partitioned finite-difference approach that enhances scalability of the gradient computations. Several synthetic experiments and a real world case study demonstrate that application of the proposed approaches yields improvements in terms of both prediction accuracy and computational performance. The work has applications in real-world deployments of simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment systems.}

abstract = {This study develops a Complete LAne-Changing Decision (CLACD) modeling framework that explains both the mandatory and discretionary lane-changing behaviors, incorporates both the successful and failed lane-changing attempts, and describes lane-changing behaviors in both the traditional and connected environments. The connected environment provides real-time and valuable information about surrounding vehicles and downstream situations (e.g., congestion ahead) that drivers cannot foresee. Such information can be particularly useful for complex driving maneuvers like discretionary lane-changing (DLC), which requires information about surrounding traffic speeds and subsequent gaps available on the adjacent lanes. DLC modeling efforts in the connected environment appear to be nascent, primarily because of: (a) the novelty of the connected environment (and the consequent scarcity of the relevant data), and (b) the lack of a behaviorally sound DLC model even for the traditional environment (that is, without driver-aid messages). Moreover, the existing models omit failed DLC attempts by motorists that are likely to create traffic disruptions and have a significant impact on traffic safety. To overcome these challenges, this study develops a DLC model (i.e., CLACD model) for the traditional environment, which is extended for the connected environment. An integrated approach is employed to model DLC behavior by combining the target lane selection using the utility theory approach and the gap acceptance behavior using a game theory approach. To collect high-quality vehicle trajectory data in the connected environment, the CARRS-Q advanced driving simulator was used. The CLACD models (for both the traditional and connected environments) are calibrated using NGSIM and the driving simulator data, and the CLACD models’ performances were rigorously assessed using various performance indicators. Results reveal that the CLACD models can effectively capture the observed DLC decisions with high accuracy. The performance of CLACD models is compared with the performance of two alternative models described in the literature, revealing that the CLACD models outperform the alternatives. A sensitivity analysis suggests a consistent trend of the CLACD models, which agrees with past research. Furthermore, the CLACD model shows a realistic prediction of traffic flow patterns compared with the utility theory model. By incorporating failed DLC attempts into the CLACD models, the performance and realism of CLACD models have been significantly improved.}

The model-based optimisation component operates based upon an underlying kinematic wave model driven by stochastic demand within a prediction horizon. The data-driven optimisation component operates based upon an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) formulation which approximates the state-control interactions over future stages with a parametric approximator. The approximator reduces the computational complexity of the adaptive control problem by parameterising the state and decision space. The parametric approximator is to be iteratively updated with online feeding of realisations of traffic states via a temporal difference (TD) learning process. Our results reveal that incorporation of the model-based component facilitates the training of the ADP-based state approximator, and hence improve the overall performance of the control system. We further develop a decentralised solution approach in which individual intersections are allowed to derive their own control policies in an asynchronous manner. The data-driven ADP approximator would serve as a central agent coordinating the control policies derived at individual intersections in the network. This is shown to be able to improve and stabilise the performance of the overall control system even under congested conditions. This is a significant progress in adaptive control system design with use of decentralised optimisation techniques. The present study contributes to the adaptive network traffic control with uncertainties through use of advanced modelling and optimisation methods.}

abstract = {Variable speed limits (VSLs) are a common traffic control measure to resolve freeway jam waves. State-of-the-art model predictive control (MPC) approaches of VSLs are developed based on Eulerian Lighthill-Whitham and Richards (LWR) models, where the decision variables are flows between road segments. It is difficult to implement constraints on speeds that are necessary in typical real-world speed limit systems, because converting flow to speed results in nonlinear and non-convex optimization formulations. In this paper, we develop a new MPC of VSLs based on a discrete Lagrangian LWR model, in which the decision variables are average speeds of vehicle groups. This allows formulating speed constraints as control constraints rather than state constraints in the MPC problem. The optimization of vehicle groups speeds is formulated as a linear programming problem which can be solved efficiently. We further integrate the presented MPC to a hierarchical VSL control framework leveraging connected vehicles. The presented MPC decides the optimal target speed of each vehicle group led by a connected automated vehicle (CAV) at the upper macroscopic level with a prediction horizon of 20 min. At the lower microscopic level, CAVs randomly distributed in mixed traffic are regarded as actuators of the upper layer. Microscopic CAV accelerations are optimized in a short horizon of the order 5–10 s so that the human-driven vehicles following them reach the target speed from the upper layer in an efficient and smooth manner. The presented MPC and the hierarchical control approach are tested in microscopic simulation environments. Simulation results show that (i) the presented MPC resolves freeway jam waves efficiently with reasonable safety constraints implemented, and (ii) the presented hierarchical control approach can effectively resolve jam waves in a single-lane freeway, even though the penetration rate of CAVs is as low as 5\%.}

The modelling principles are based on similar principles successfully applied in our previous work on pedestrian and vessel flow. The main contributions of the paper are in the extension towards modelling cyclists that has not been proposed in literature before, and in the insights gained by simulation with the model using different scenarios, showing how the model outcomes depend on the modelling choices and parameters. The generalisation entails two major changes compared to our previous pedestrian model. First of all, the model does justice to the kinematics of cyclists. Contrary to pedestrians, cyclist are more restricted in their movement. The model approximates these restrictions by considering speed and movement direction and changes therein. Secondly, the model includes different strategies (cooperative, zero-acceleration, demon opponent) in its underlying game-theoretical framework, and allows including traffic rules. This allows us to model different attitudes towards risk representing different types of cyclists. The (qualitative) insights gained by application of the model pertain to one-on-one interactions between cyclists and the impact of the strategy assumptions and parameter choices on those interactions as well as on the collective phenomena that occur in the cyclist flow and their sensitivity to parameters (reflecting the extent of the prediction horizon, the level of anisotropy, and the relative importance of keeping the desired path). With respect to the collective phenomena, we look at efficiency and self-organised patterns. We conclude that the model acts in a plausible manner. While we do not aim to show empirical validity, we see that the qualitative behaviour of one-on-one interactions is plausible if compared to experimental or field data. We also observe plausible collective patterns, including forms of self-organisation under specific parameter settings. The latter is not trivial given the fundamental differences in bicycle and pedestrian flow.}

To achieve low vehicle-to-road-side-unit (V2R) communication delay and support the implementation of CAV-based intersection control strategies, this study addresses the problem of road side unit (RSU) location optimization at a single intersection. Considering the uncertainty of the selection of intersection control strategies, the problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer nonlinear program. The model aims to minimize the sum of the cost associated with RSU investment and the expectation of the penalty cost associated with V2R communication delay exceeding a pre-determined threshold. The first stage of the program determines the number and location of RSUs, when the intersection control strategy to be implemented is unknown. Given the first stage decision and the implemented intersection control strategy, the second stage model optimizes the detection area allocation among RSUs to minimize the penalty cost. The model is linearized using the piecewise linearization technique. Then an integer L-Shaped algorithm is proposed to find a global optimal solution to the linearized program. In the numerical example, the proposed model is compared with a deterministic model. The results demonstrate that the V2R communication reduction per cost obtained by the proposed model is 28.95 larger than that obtained by the deterministic model, in the scenario that a CAV-based control strategy is implemented in the second stage. This indicates that the proposed model provides cost-effective low V2R communication delay for intersection control in CAV environment.}

abstract = {It has been well known that properly coordinating travelers’ route choices will help mitigate urban traffic congestion. Accordingly, coordinated routing mechanisms (CRMs), functioned as coordinated network congestion management schemes, have been developed in recent years. They often employ game theory models to strategically coordinate the route decisions of a group of travelers en route with the aim to reduce network traffic congestion. However, existing studies do not provide the solution about how to form the traveler groups, such as who and how many travelers the CRMs should involve. This issue may jeopardize the efficiency and scalability of the CRMs in practical applications. To make up this gap, this study seeks to develop the clustering aided network modeling approaches to form the coordination groups (CGs), which have the proper members and sizes for supporting the merits of the congestion management schemes. Specifically, we define coordination potential as an index to indicate the potential benefit for coordinating travelers’ route decisions on network congestion reduction. Then we develop rigorous approaches to understand the mathematical features and further quantify the coordination potential between two travelers, and among multiple travelers. Built upon that, we form the CGs through a well-designed adaptive centroid-based clustering algorithm (ACCA). It secures a local optimal clustering solution, balancing the intra-cluster and inter-cluster CP, so that we can ensure a small system performance loss as we implement a CRM on each CG. The efficiency of the CG formation approach is evaluated by the CG-CRM scheme, which partitions the travelers into multiple CGs and independently coordinates the travelers’ route choices in each CG by a CRM. The numerical experiments built upon both Sioux Falls and Hardee city networks confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of the CG formation approach. Mainly, the CG-CRM outperforms the independent best response routing mechanism in system performance. As compared to the CRM working on a single group involving all travelers, the CG-CRM requires significantly less computation load with a minor compromise on the system performance. This merit becomes more apparent under high penetration and congested traffic condition. Therefore, we claim that the CG formation approach will significantly help the implementation of the coordinated congestion mitigation schemes in practice.}

The proposed framework adopts the flexible asymmetric behavior (AB) model to reveal the control mechanisms and their manifestation in the physical CF behavior, particularly their response to traffic disturbances. A mapping relationship between the AB model parameters and control parameters is then obtained to understand the range of CF behavior possible. Finally, a predictive modeling approach based on a logistic classifier coupled with a convoluted Multivariate Gaussian Process (MGP) is designed to predict the CF behavior of an AV. Analysis of two well-known controllers, linear state-feedback and Model Predictive Control (MPC), show how the proposed framework can uncover the CF mechanisms and provide insights into traffic-level disturbance evolution. The proposed analysis framework remains scalable and can be applied to a variety of controllers. Ultimately, it can guide AV control design that is not myopic, but considers traffic-level performance.}

Analysis of commuting vehicles can lay foundation for policy formulation, urban planning, business decision-making. A large number of license plate recognition (LPR) detectors installed on the road network have accumulated a large amount of LPR data that contain the spatio-temporal information on vehicles. Therefore, using the LPR data, the commuting behavior of vehicles can be mined and analyzed. This study takes the LPR data of Hangzhou, China as an example, a series of algorithms are used to extract a total of nine features reflecting the commuting travel behavior using the one-month LPR data, and then the factor analysis method is used to integrate the nine extracted features into three factors. The commuting behavior is characterized from three perspectives: the stability of the vehicle travel behavior during the high frequency travel time period on working days, the stability of the vehicle travel behavior during the non high frequency travel time period, the stability of the origin and destination (OD) of a vehicle during the high frequency travel time period. Based on these three factors, three methods, including the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm (DBSCAN), the iterative self-organizing data analysis technique algorithm (ISODATA), and the fast search and find of density peaks clustering algorithm, are used to identify commuting pattern vehicles and their results are compared. Finally, the decision tree algorithm is used to extract the commuting rule and identify commuting vehicles from the collected data. After that, The influence of different high frequency travel time period on commuting rule extraction and commuting pattern vehicle recognition is carefully analyzed. The influence of randomness on the results is also tested. The proposed commuting pattern vehicle recognition algorithm is proved to be robust. The detection frequency and the first and last detected times of commuting vehicles and non commuting vehicles are then analyzed. 78.0\% of commuting vehicles were first detected between 06:30 AM and 10:30 AM on each workday on average. And 77.8\% of commuting vehicles were last detected between 03:30 PM and 09:30 PM on each workday on average. However, for non commuting vehicles, the phenomenon that start or end the travel during the high frequency travel time period is not obvious. This study lays a foundation for travel policy formulation. For instance, it can provide a reference for the determination of the restricted periods when implementing the travel restriction policy. In addition, the identification of commuting vehicles is extremely useful for public transit network design and optimization, and it can help the decision-making process of a customized commuter bus. In addition, these strategies are expected to reduce the use of private cars and encourage travelers to switch to public transportation.}

abstract = {Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are promoted as a technology that will create a future with effortless driving and virtually no traffic accidents. AV companies claim that, when fully developed, the technology will eliminate 94\% of all accidents that are caused by human error. Indeed, these AVs will likely avoid the large number of crashes caused by impaired, distracted or reckless drivers. But there remains a significant proportion of crashes for which no driver is directly responsible. In particular, the absence of connectivity of an AV with its neighboring vehicles (V2V) and the infrastructure (I2V) leads to a lack of information that can induce such crashes. Since AV designs today do not require such connectivity, these crashes would persist in the future. Using prototypical examples motivated by the NHTSA pre-crash scenario typology, we show that fully autonomous vehicles cannot guarantee safety in the absence of connectivity. Combining theoretical models and empirical data, we also argue that such hazardous scenarios will occur with a significantly high probability. This suggests that incorporating connectivity is an essential step on the path towards safe AV technology.}

In this paper, features relating to runway excursion causal factors are extracted from flight data from over 310,448 flights from Airbus A320 series aircraft flown on a European network. The data is combined with meteorological data to provide additional features. Bayesian networks are then learnt from the feature set, and two network learning algorithms are compared, Bayesian Search and Greedy Thick Thinning (GTT). Cross-validation of the resulting networks shows both algorithms produce similarly performing networks, and a subjective analysis concludes that the GTT algorithm is marginally preferred. The resulting networks produce relative probabilities, which airlines can use to quantitatively assess runway veer-off risk under different scenarios, such as different meteorological conditions and unstable approaches. This paper's main finding is that by utilising existing data sources, such as FDM and weather databases, airlines can create and use Bayesian networks alongside their existing qualitative risk assessment methods to provide quantitative risk assessment and understand the effect of different conditions on those risks. This is not possible with current methods in use by airlines. The method described can be extended to other operational safety risks, such as runway overrun.}

Dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) has been widely used to model travelers’ route choice or/and departure-time choice and predict dynamic traffic flow evolution in the short term. However, the existing DTA models do not explicitly describe one’s selection of driving velocity on a road link. Driving velocity choice may not be crucial for modeling the movement of human drivers but it is a must-have control to maneuver AVs. In this paper, we aim to develop a game-theoretic model to solve for AVs’ optimal driving strategies of velocity control in the interior of a road link and route choice at a junction node. To this end, we will first reinterpret the DTA problem as an N-car differential game and show that this game can be tackled with a general mean field game-theoretic framework. The developed mean field game is challenging to solve because of the forward and backward structure for velocity control and the complementarity conditions for route choice. An efficient algorithm is developed to address these challenges. The model and the algorithm are illustrated on the Braess network and the OW network with a single destination. On the Braess network, we first compare the LWR based DTA model with the proposed game and find that the driving and routing control navigates AVs with overall lower costs. We then compare the total travel cost without and with the middle link and find that the Braess paradox may still arise under certain conditions. We also test our proposed model and solution algorithm on the OW network.}

abstract = {Ensuring safer mobility for evacuee drivers during a hurricane evacuation has always been a major concern for traffic managers. That concern has grown further, particularly after recent hurricanes, which forced millions of people to evacuate, causing significant congestion and a high number of traffic crashes. Though several strategies have been deployed to manage the heavy traffic demand during a hurricane evacuation, current approaches seem to have less impact on traffic safety. In a situation where people are ordered to evacuate to a safer place involving long hours of driving, perception related errors are inevitable. In such conditions, advanced driving assistance system or vehicle automation can have a positive impact. In this study, we assess the safety impact of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems during an evacuation. We develop a microscopic simulation model of evacuation traffic in SUMO and calibrate it using real-world traffic data collected during the evacuation period of hurricane Irma for a segment in the Interstate highway in Florida. To evaluate the safety impact of ACC systems, we adopt two surrogate measures: time to collision (TTC) and deceleration rate to avoid a collision (DRAC). Our simulation experiments show that, during the evacuation, about 49.7\% of traffic collisions can be reduced at a 25\% market penetration of ACC equipped vehicles. Our result has potential implications for hurricane evacuation management since a modest decrease in the number of crashes can help reduce the massive delays most commonly experienced during a major evacuation.}

By capturing the dynamic evolution of high-speed trains in the actual environment, an error dynamic state-space model is established considering uncertain parameters, input constraints and disturbances to the train motion. According to the event-triggered control framework, a co-design method is introduced to design the cruise controller and the event-triggered condition jointly. Based on the Lyapunov stability method, a sufficient condition for the existence of the robust state-feedback control law and the event-triggered condition parameter are presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which ensures that the high-speed train tracks the desired speed, and the coupler deviations are stable at the equilibrium point under external disturbances. With the fact that the event-triggered controller often requires a dedicated detector to continuously monitor the system state, a self-triggered implementation is further developed to dynamically calculate the next triggered instant at each update time based on recently collected information. In the end, numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in tracking the desired movement profiles, and thereby demonstrates the advantages of the proposed self-triggered controller over the traditional periodic triggered control method.}

By contemporaneously coalescing the short- and long-range information, the CAV can construct comprehensively its surrounding environment and thereby facilitate informed, safe, and effective movement planning in the short-term (local decisions including lane change) and long-term (route choice). Current literature provides useful information on CAV control approaches that use only local information sensed from the proximate traffic environment but relatively little guidance on how to fuse this information with that obtained from downstream sources and from different time stamps, and how to use the fused information to enhance CAV movements. In this paper, we describe a Deep Reinforcement Learning based approach that integrates the data collected through sensing and connectivity capabilities from other vehicles located in the proximity of the CAV and from those located further downstream, and we use the fused data to guide lane changing, a specific context of CAV operations. In addition, recognizing the importance of the connectivity range (CR) to the performance of not only the algorithm but also of the vehicle in the actual driving environment, the study carried out a case study. The case study demonstrates the application of the proposed algorithm and duly identifies the appropriate CR for each level of prevailing traffic density. It is expected that implementation of the algorithm in CAVs can enhance the safety and mobility associated with CAV driving operations. From a general perspective, its implementation can provide guidance to connectivity equipment manufacturers and CAV operators, regarding the default CR settings for CAVs or the recommended CR setting in a given traffic environment.}

abstract = {The use of drones for parcel delivery has recently attracted wide attention due to its potential in improving efficiency of the last-mile delivery. Though attempts have been made on combined truck-drone delivery to deploy multiple drones that can deliver multiple packages per trip, many placed extra assumptions to simplify the problem. This paper investigates the multi-visit traveling salesman problem with multi-drones (MTSP-MD), whose objective is to minimize the time (makespan) required by the truck and the drones to serve all customers together. The energy consumption of the drone depends on the flight time, the self-weight of the drone and the total weight of packages carried by the drone, which declines after each delivery throughout the drone flight. The MTSP-MD problem consists of three complicated sub-problems, namely (1) the drone flight problem with both a payload capacity constraint and an energy endurance constraint, (2) the traveling salesman problem with precedence constraints, and (3) the synchronization problem between the truck route and the drone schedules. The problem is first formulated into a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) model and we propose a multi-start tabu search (MSTS) algorithm with tailored neighborhood structure and a two-level solution evaluation method that incorporates a drone-level segment-based evaluation and a solution-level evaluation based on the critical path method (CPM). The experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed algorithm on small-scale instances and show a significant cost reduction when considering multi-visits, multi-drones, and drones with higher payload capacity and higher battery capacity for medium and large-scale instances.}

abstract = {Under increasing economic and environmental pressure, airlines are constantly seeking new technologies and optimizing flight operations to reduce fuel consumption. However, the current practice on fuel loading, which has a significant impact on aircraft weight and fuel consumption, has yet to be thoroughly addressed by existing studies. Excess fuel is loaded by dispatchers and (or) pilots to handle fuel consumption uncertainties, primarily caused by flight time uncertainties, which cannot be predicted by current Flight Planning Systems (FPS). In this paper, we develop a novel spatial weighted recurrent neural network model to provide better flight time predictions by capturing air traffic information at a national scale based on multiple data sources, including Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B), Meteorological Aerodrome Reports (METAR), and airline records. In this model, a spatial weighted layer is designed to extract spatial dependences among network delay states (i.e. average flight delay at each airport and average flight delay of each Origin-Destination (OD) pair for a specific time interval). Then, a new training procedure associated with the spatial weighted layer is introduced to extract OD-specific spatial weights and then integrate into one model for a nationwide air traffic network. Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are used after the spatial weighted layer to extract the temporal behavior patterns of network delay states. Finally, features from delays, weather, and flight schedules are fed into a fully connected neural network to predict the flight time of a particular flight. The proposed model was evaluated using one year of historical data from an airline’s real operations. Results show that our model can provide a more accurate flight time predictions than baseline methods, especially for flights with extreme delays. We also show that, with the improved flight time prediction, fuel loading can be optimized and resulting reduced fuel consumption by 0.016\%–1.915\% without increasing the fuel depletion risk.}

abstract = {This study proposes a multi-vehicle anticipation-based discrete-continuous choice modelling framework for describing driver behaviour in heterogeneous disordered traffic (HDT) conditions. To incorporate multi-vehicle anticipation, the concept of an influence zone around a vehicle (subject vehicle) is introduced. Vehicles within the influence zone can potentially influence the subject vehicle’s driving behaviour. Further, driving decisions are characterized as combination of discrete and continuous components. The discrete component involves the decision to accelerate, decelerate, or maintain constant speed and the continuous component involves the decision of how much to accelerate or decelerate. A copula-based joint modelling framework that allows dependencies between discrete and continuous components is proposed. Such a joint modelling framework recognizes that the discrete and continuous decisions are made simultaneously, and common unobserved factors influence both decisions. Additionally, truncated distributions are employed for the continuous model components to avoid the prediction of unrealistically high acceleration or deceleration values. The parameters of the proposed model are estimated using a trajectory dataset from Chennai, India. The empirical results underscore (a) the importance of considering multi-vehicle anticipation for describing driving behaviour in HDT conditions, and (b) the efficacy of the joint discrete-continuous system for modelling driving behaviour. Further, not all traffic environment variables found to influence the discrete decisions were found influential on continuous decisions and vice versa. Moreover, the influence of several variables was found to be stronger on the decision to accelerate or decelerate than on the decision of how much to accelerate or decelerate.}

The available dataset consists of more than 48,000 driving trips conducted in the Region of Attica, Greece, and is enriched with exogenous variables, such as population density and land use in each trips’ destination area. Findings reveal that the time of day in which the trip was performed, as well as trip duration and length, significantly affect parking searching duration. In addition, the land use of the destination area appears to be a significant factor for predicting parking searching duration. Although all survival models share similar results in terms of the significance of the parameters, deep survival neural networks noticeably improve the survival time predictions.}

On the one hand, we can explicitly implement domain-knowledge or physical priors such as anticipating that vehicles will follow the middle of the roads. While this perspective leads to feasible outputs, it has limited performance due to the difficulty to hand-craft complex interactions in urban environments. On the other hand, recent works use data-driven approaches which can learn complex interactions from the data leading to superior performance. However, generalization, i.e., having accurate predictions on unseen data, is an issue leading to unrealistic outputs. In this paper, we propose to learn a “Realistic Residual Block” (RRB), which effectively connects these two perspectives. Our RRB takes any off-the-shelf knowledge-driven model and finds the required residuals to add to the knowledge-aware trajectory. Our proposed method outputs realistic predictions by confining the residual range and taking into account its uncertainty. We also constrain our output with Model Predictive Control (MPC) to satisfy kinematic constraints. Using a publicly available dataset, we show that our method outperforms previous works in terms of accuracy and generalization to new scenes. Code is available at: https://github.com/vita-epfl/RRB.}

Using GPS data collected from the real operation of 6,500 commercial vehicles over a period of three months, the proposed method was tested. In total, five profiles were constructed, accommodating activity-travel patterns associated with vans, cars, trucks-35 t (light trucks), trucks-3ax (medium trucks), and buses. Similarities and differences in these profiles across vehicle types were revealed, and specific locations corresponding to the activities of the patterns were further examined. Moreover, using these profiles as a reference, the travel practice of a specific vehicle was evaluated. The experimental results demonstrate the potential and effectiveness of the approach in depicting business travel patterns, providing a deep understanding of business travel behaviour, and assisting the design and evaluation of policies for more sustainable business transport.}

In particular, confusion arises in the selection of measure of performances and goodness-of-fit functions. In this study, a methodology to compare and rank objective functions is thus proposed, which is based on Pareto-efficiency and on indifference curves. The methodology has been applied to all objective functions used in the field literature so far (and to new ones), in a vast set of calibration experiments. The experiments involved two car-following models and two adaptive cruise control (ACC) algorithms, and four different datasets, including both automated and human-driven vehicles trajectories. Since results are consistent among all the calibration experiments, a sound and robust guideline to calibrate car-following dynamics has been proposed. It includes recommendation about what calibration settings should be avoided and what are to be adopted. On the one hand, a general agreement on a sound calibration setting for car-following models is deemed necessary for comparing results from different studies which use different models and datasets. On the other hand, any new car-following model or objective function being developed in the future shall be compared with existing ones in a fair and impartial manner. For these reasons, and to promote and enable transparent and reproducible research, codes and data from this study are shared with the community.}

With the development of connected vehicle technologies and the popularization of ride-hailing services, probe vehicle data are now being collected on a large scale. Some studies have shown that queue lengths can be estimated using only probe vehicle data. The relevant literature usually assumes the queue lengths in different traffic signal cycles are independent and identically distributed or treats the queues independently. However, in the real world, the queue lengths in different cycles might be correlated. For instance, when there exists an overflow queue, the queue length in the following cycle is correlated with the queue length in the previous cycle. In fact, the correlation of different cycles can provide additional information and thus improve the queue length estimation accuracy. In this paper, we model such queueing processes in probe vehicle environments using a hidden Markov model (HMM), where the queue length in each cycle is a hidden state, and the observed pattern of probe vehicles is an observation. Based on the HMM, we propose two novel cycle-by-cycle queue length estimation methods. In the case where the parameters of the HMM are unknown, we also provide an algorithm that can estimate the parameters from historical probe vehicle data. Validation results show that the proposed cycle-by-cycle queue length estimation methods outperform the existing methods, and the parameter learning algorithm can estimate the parameters adequately.}

Dynamical models based on the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) enable development of model predictive perimeter control methods for large-scale urban networks, representing an advanced control solution carrying substantial potential for field implementation. In this paper we develop a multi-region approximation of the trip-based model, which describes in more details the trip length characteristics compared to existing accumulation-based models. The proposed M-model includes effects of the total remaining travel distance on the transfer flows driving the vehicle accumulation dynamics, potentially yielding improved accuracy over the standard production-over-trip length approximation of the outflow MFD considered in many works on MFD-based modeling and control. We explain that to properly perform perimeter control, boundary queue dynamics have to be integrated. Furthermore, model-based parameter estimation (MBPE), nonlinear moving horizon observer (MHO), and model predictive control (MPC) formulations for the proposed models are presented, forming an integrated traffic control framework. Microsimulation-based case studies, considering an urban network with 1500 links, where the model parameters obtained by MBPE method are used in MHO and MPC design, demonstrate the efficient operation of the proposed framework.}

Addressing this need, we propose three different versions of network representation and mathematical models for the activity-based vehicle routing problem to connect activity-travel graphs of passengers (demand layer) to spatio-temporal networks of vehicles (supply layer). Versions I and II are arc-based, while version III is path-based. In version I, we introduce the concept of activity-travel graphs for passengers. For vehicles, we construct space–time networks and add a new dimension, called “under-service state”, to track the execution status of trip requests at any location and time. In version II, we reduce the complexity of the network structure by eliminating the state dimension and some other modifications in the structure of the passengers’ and vehicles’ network. Although both versions can capture various behavioral constraints of the activity-based vehicle routing problem (e.g., mandatory and optimal activities, duration of activities, chain of activities, preferred starting and ending times of activities), due to the high level of complexity of the network structure, both versions can only solve small-sized problems. To tackle the computational complexity, we propose a path-based network representation in version III, and to make a balance between the disutility of passengers and vehicles, we present a tolled user equilibrium problem. Mathematical models are coded in C and GAMS and implemented on real-world Phoenix regional transportation network with more than 39 million trip requests, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution for the original and restricted master problems.}

Identifying the best spatial distribution of bus-only lanes in order to maximize traffic performance of an urban network while balancing the trade-off between bus priority and regular traffic disturbance is a challenging task. This paper studies the problem of optimal dedicated bus lane allocation and proposes a modeling framework based on a link-level dynamic traffic modeling paradigm, which is compatible with the dynamic characteristics of congestion propagation that can be correlated with bus lane relative positions. The problem is formulated as a non-linear combinatorial optimization problem with binary variables. An algorithmic scheme based on a problem-specific heuristic and Large Neighborhood Search metaheuristic, potentially combined with a network decomposition technique and a performance-based learning process for increased efficiency, is proposed for deriving good quality solutions for large-scale network instances. Numerical application results for a real city center demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework in finding effective bus lane network configurations; when compared to the initial network state they exhibit the potential of bus lanes to improve travel time for car and bus users.}

In this paper, we propose a methodological framework, based on two distinct methods, to determine these prevailing paths. The first method requires the information about travel patterns in the urban network as well as the information about the city network partitioning. The second method is more parsimonious, and consists on the direct calculation of shortest-cost paths on the aggregated network. For this, we propose four impedance functions that utilize topological features of the urban network and its partitioning. We test the performance of this methodological framework for determining the most prevailing paths on a network representing the metropolitan area of Lyon (France). We consider a set of real trajectories (i.e. GPS data) of drivers in this network as a benchmark. We show that the proposed methods are able to identify the most prevailing paths as the ones chosen by drivers, as evidenced by a large similarity value between the sets of paths. Based on a maximum likelihood estimation, we also show that the Weibull distribution is the one that better reproduces the functional form of the network-wide distribution of travel distances. However, the characterization of the functional form of such distributions characteristic to each region defining a path is not trivial, and depends on the complex topological features of the urban network concerning the definition of its partitioning. We also show that the Euclidean distance metrics provides good estimates of the average travel distances. Interestingly, we also show that the most prevailing paths are not necessarily the ones that have the lowest average travel distances.}

One of these missing attributes is the trip purpose attribute. This paper proposes a novel method to infer the trip purpose attribute from the sequences of trips of passengers instead of separate trips. The proposed method infers the trip purpose attribute (a missing attribute in the smart card data) from the temporal attributes (available attributes in the smart card data). First, the relation between the temporal attributes and the trip purpose attribute is learnt by discovering clusters of passengers in the Household Travel Survey dataset while each passenger is represented by one sequence of trips. Then, the discovered clusters are utilized to infer the trip purpose of smart card transactions by allocating each passenger to the closest clusters. The proposed method is implemented on the smart card and HTS datasets from southeast Queensland, Australia. The evaluation results showed a considerable improvement in inferring the trip purpose compared to the results published in the literature. Notably, the effect of considering the trip sequence was more significant than considering land use variables.}

Existing studies have concluded that complexity is a necessary criticality measure for supporting critical AV testing scenario identification. However, the existing scenario complexity quantification studies mainly have two limitations, namely, subjective quantification methods highly rely on human participations and are difficult to apply to big data, and existing objective methods lack consideration of human driver characteristics and hence the performance cannot be guaranteed. To bridge these research gaps, a general objective quantification framework is proposed to quantify human drivers’ judgement on driving environment complexity, by describing the vehicle-vehicle spatial-temporal interactions from the perspectives of quantity, variety, and relations. The model mainly contains three parts. First, to describe quantity information, a dynamic influencing area was set to identify the surrounding vehicles that contribute to driving environment complexity based on Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) theory. Second, considering the various surrounding vehicles’ driving statuses, behaviors, and intentions, a basic vehicle-pair complexity quantification model was constructed based on encounter angles. Then, nonlinear relationships based upon information entropy theory were introduced to capture the heterogeneous longitudinal and lateral complexities. Third, a vehicle-pair complexity aggregation and smoothing step was conducted to reflect the characteristics of human driver's cognition. To demonstrate the abovementioned model, empirical Field Operational Test (FOT) data from Shanghai urban roadways were used to conduct case studies, and it can be concluded that this model can accurately describe the timing and extent of the complexity change, and reveal the complexity differences due to scenario type and spatial-temporal heterogeneity. Besides, Inter-Rater Reliability (IRR) index was calculated to validate the consistency of scenario complexity judgement between the proposed model and human drivers, and for performance comparison with the existing models. Finally, the applications of the proposed model and its further investigations have been discussed.}

For aggregated data under stationary conditions, flow and density are related by the fundamental diagram. However, high resolution data obtained from modern sensor networks is generally non-stationary and disaggregated. Such data consequently show significant statistical fluctuations. These fluctuations are best described using a bivariate probability distribution in the density–flow plane. By applying kernel density estimation to high-volume data from the UK National Traffic Information Service (NTIS), we empirically construct these distributions for London’s M25 motorway. Curves in the density–flow plane are then constructed, analogous to quantiles of univariate distributions. These curves quantitatively separate atypical fluctuations from typical traffic states. Although the algorithm identifies anomalies in general rather than specific events, we find that fluctuations outside the 95\% probability curve correlate strongly with the spikes in travel time associated with significant congestion events. Moreover, the size of an excursion from the typical region provides a simple, real-time measure of the severity of detected anomalies. We validate the algorithm by benchmarking its ability to identify labelled events in historical NTIS data against some commonly used methods from the literature. Detection rate, time-to-detect and false alarm rate are used as metrics and found to be generally comparable except in situations when the speed distribution is bi-modal. In such situations, the new algorithm achieves a much lower false alarm rate without suffering significant degradation on the other metrics. This method has the additional advantages of being self-calibrating and adaptive: the curve marking atypical behaviour is different for each section of road and can evolve in time as the data changes, for example, due to long-term roadworks.}

abstract = {This study addresses the tactical electric vehicle fleet size (EVFS) problem faced by carsharing service (CSS) providers while considering the operational vehicle assignment, vehicle relocation, and vehicle charging strategies (i.e., the charging duration at each station) in pursuit of profit maximization. To alleviate battery degradation and achieve cost-saving in the long term, we propose the on-demand charging strategy to determine fleet size. The novelty of this study lies in the incorporation of nonlinear battery wear cost incurred during the battery charging and discharging processes. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model with concave and convex terms in the objective function is first developed for the EVFS problem. Piecewise linear approximation approach and outer-approximation method are employed to linearize the proposed model. Numerical experiments based on EVCARD, a one-way electric carsharing operator in China, are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model and solution method, as well as the necessity of incorporating the battery degradation into the fleet size determination of CSSs. The impacts of several key parameters, i.e., the daily fixed cost of EV and battery price, battery cycle efficiency, service charge, and relocation cost on the performance of one-way electric CSSs are also analyzed.}

Users may override AV mode due to arrival time pressure, facility constraint (e.g., “I will have to make a U-turn a mile away if I do not cross the solid double-yellow lines here”), drug and alcohol influence, pleasure, envy (e.g., “why the front car can surpass that slow truck but I can’t?”), insufficient law enforcement, driving culture, media and public sentiment, etc. Therefore, the installation and the usage of AV technologies should not be instantaneously assumed ignorable in planning and policy studies. This paper is dedicated to clarifying this confusion by demonstrating that ignoring the difference between the installation and the usage of AV technologies might lead to systematic bias in evaluating policy and investment decisions. Through a system dynamics (SD) model, the complex interactions of relevant factors are captured so that the mixed traffic condition influences traffic law enforcement adjustment effort and system investment decisions, which, in turn, influence the AV technology usage share and the system performance. The case study applies to the greater Washington, D.C. area for demonstrating the feasibility and advantages of the proposed model and for studying policy implications. This paper does not attempt to forecast; instead, it proposes a modeling framework for studying the conditions under which differentiating the installation and the usage of AV technologies might be critical in forecasting the traffic composition trend and system performance for public policy and investment decisions.}

To ensure balanced supply–demand of shared cars in the operational areas, ECS operators tend to explore user-based relocation strategies in addition to the costly operator-based ones. Through a stated preference experiment administered in the Netherlands, we study the travel preferences for ECS and user-based relocation strategies in a comprehensive framework integrating people’s current mobility choices and contextual variables. Incentives for picking-up/dropping-off shared cars at distant alternative locations and sharing rides are embedded in two sub-experiments of varied trip distances. The results from an error component multinomial logit (EC-MNL) model show multi-faceted preferences. Particularly, we find that people interested in ECS are willing to collaborate with ECS operators. Alternative pick-up is the most favorite relocation strategy, followed by alternative drop-off and sharing rides. The willingness to accept the incentive for additional access and egress time is estimated as high as 0.33 EUR per walking minute. It is also found that respondents do not show significant differences in preferences for car sanitation by ECS operators or self-service during the times of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study provides useful implications for operators and policy-makers regarding the user characteristics and contextual settings favoring user-based relocation strategies.}

Around logistics hubs such as seaports, truck flows can have a major impact on the surrounding motorways. Hence, their prediction is important to help manage traffic operations. However, The link between short-term dynamics of logistics activities and the generation of truck traffic has not yet been properly explored. This paper aims to develop a model that predicts short-term changes in truck volumes, generated from major container terminals in maritime ports. We develop, test, and demonstrate the model for the port of Rotterdam. Our input data are derived from exchanges of operational logistics messages between terminal operators, carriers and shippers, via the local Port Community System. We propose a feed-forward neural network to predict the next one hour of outbound truck traffic. To extract hidden features from the input data and select a model with appropriate features, we employ an evolutionary algorithm in accordance with the neural network model. Our model predicts outbound truck volumes with high accuracy. We formulate 2 scenarios to evaluate the forecasting abilities of the model. The model predicts lag and non-proportional responses of truck flows to changes in container turnover at terminals. The findings are relevant for traffic management agencies to help improve the efficiency and reliability of transport networks, in particular around major freight hubs.}

These probe vehicles are called as backward probe vehicles (BP) and they are proven to measure the traffic flow and density. Using some advanced technology, a BP is assumed to estimate the flow of vehicles running forward from their passing time measurements along the BP trajectory. Then, as a useful application for the flow measurement by a BP, we propose a data assimilation method that estimates traffic states under an incident on an expressway section utilizing BP measurements in addition to conventional probe vehicles moving forward (forward probe vehicles) and detector data. Ample literature exists on traffic state estimation using several sensing data. However, they have difficulty in estimating traffic states during an incident, since the observations of the incident period and the declined flow rate due to the incident may not be sufficiently accurate. Therefore, this study proposes a state space model (SSM) that estimates traffic states under an incident on an expressway utilizing BP measurements. The model validation using a hypothetical network with an incident confirms the promising potential of the proposed model; that is, the reproducibility of traffic states using BP measurements is superior to one using forward probe measurements.}

Thus, it becomes an integral part of the design and management of PT systems, but corresponding transit assignment models for improving the prediction of passenger ridership have yet to be developed. This work proposes a novel stochastic transit assignment model that predicts passenger ridership. Two new features are incorporated into a transit assignment model, namely, personalization and bounded rationality. Personalization refers to a personalized route-ranking methodology so that the app recommends paths with respect to a traveler’s preference considering various PT attributes. Bounded rationality is modeled over three route-choice strategies representing different levels of cognitive effort exercised by a traveler in selecting a path from the set of paths recommended by the app. The transit assignment model is formulated as a fixed-point problem. Because the mapping function of the fixed-point formulation is not necessarily continuous, the model constructs an approximated fixed point existing under certain measures of discontinuity. The method of successive averages (MSA) is applied to solve the problem. Numerical studies are conducted to demonstrate the properties of the new transit assignment model, the effect of demand on the path choice probability, and the effect of passengers’ heterogeneity on the convergence of the algorithm. The results reveal that, with a personalized path recommendation, passenger’s preferences could stabilize the differences of path choice probability when adopting route-choice strategies relying on the path order. In addition, although the MSA may not always converge and oscillate, the fluctuation is below the derived measure of discontinuity, indicating that an approximated fixed point can be found.}

The existing first-come-first-serve (FCFS) dispatching method is a myopic mechanism that sought to minimize individual-level waiting time. To improve the passenger-vehicle matching efficiency and reduce the cancelation rate, a searching tree structure is developed to deal with the vehicle dispatching problem considering vehicles still in service. This paper formulates a distinctive systematic dispatching model from the passengers' perspective and presents new dispatching rules to match passengers and vehicles. Based on an improved tree policy and efficient branch reduction policy, we customize and enhance the reinforcement learning approach, Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), to solve the multi-period sequential dispatching problem and enable efficient dispatches. The computational Complexity of MCTS is analytically derived. As benchmarks, the Hungarian algorithm, CPLEX, greedy algorithm, and two global optimization algorithms are employed. We compare these algorithms by using both simulation and real-world city-scale on-demand ride-sourcing data. Both numerical and city-scale experiment results show that the improved MCTS dispatching approach increases the percentages of satisfied passengers and dispatched drivers, and reduces the number of unmatched passengers and cumulative waiting time compared to the benchmark algorithms. The results shed light on modeling urban dispatching problems with available vehicles in both forward-looking and backward-looking time periods. This paper demonstrates that improved MCTS performs well in solving a multi-period sequential optimization problem in real-world city-scale applications.}

abstract = {This work introduces a new route-based equilibrium assignment formulation and algorithm for congested transit networks. It is an extension of De Cea and Fernández (1993), which implements congestion effects in the boarding process and introduced the concept of effective frequencies. That seminal work provides a solution algorithm for the equilibrium problem that takes advantage of two main simplifications. First, it limits the number of route sections under consideration (i.e., it considers a reduced set of attractive services for users to choose from on each leg of their trip). Second, it assumes that the flow split between attractive services can be estimated using the nominal frequencies of the services instead of the effective ones. In this paper, we develop an equilibrium model and solution algorithm that extend the original formulation without relying on the two assumptions mentioned above, while still addressing three key challenges. First, user cost functions are asymmetric in nature, and therefore, an equivalent optimization problem cannot be formulated. Second, cost functions on this approach can only be expressed implicitly, which makes the implementation of a diagonalization algorithm a challenging problem. Lastly, dealing with the whole set of route sections implies working with all feasible sets of attractive services, which can make the underlying auxiliary network grow exponentially in size. We solve the equilibrium problem by using a diagonalization algorithm, obtaining approximate diagonalized functions by solving a fixed-point problem. Our methodology also includes an efficient algorithm to generate potential candidate sets of services in the network. We test our algorithm on three networks of increasing size, where we show that the approach effectively converges to a user equilibrium solution in a matter of seconds. We also show that the benchmark original algorithm converges to solutions that violate user equilibrium conditions, exhibiting unutilized routes with lower than equilibrium costs, confirming that our algorithm is the first one to find an exact solution to the route-based public transport user equilibrium problem.}

This research aims to answer the question how benefits from UAM will be distributed, taking into account the spatial dimension and the differential impacts on low- and high-skilled households. We develop a framework that can more generally be used to assess the welfare impacts resulting from the introduction of novel transport modes. The development of an urban spatial computable general equilibrium model building on the polycentric modelling tradition developed by Anas and co-authors allows for an analysis of mutually dependent effects on the land, labour and product markets, triggered by changes on the transport market. Allowing for an endogenous spatial structure through the introduction of agglomeration effects and an amenity-based approach, the framework investigates the relevance of the initial spatial structure for the impact of the introduction of UAM. Incorporating different skill levels of households allows to assess location choice and travel behaviour for households with different characteristics. A numerical simulation of the model shows that the different initial spatial structures impose comparable welfare changes. Variations in UAM features like marginal cost, prices, land demand for infrastructure, vertical travel speed and access and egress times have a (much) more decisive impact on modal choice and welfare effects than the initial urban structure. Simulations show that considering households of different skill levels brings additional insights, as welfare effects of UAM introduction strongly differ between groups and sometimes even go in opposing directions.}

Considering the system uncertainties and the real-time control requirement of bus regulation, a robust optimal predictive control algorithm is put forward to generate the real-time optimal bus regulation strategy based on updated delay feedback of buses by a rolling horizon strategy. Simultaneously, by using continuous interval number to describe the uncertain parameters, the robust counterpart of the formulated robust optimization model is obtained using the duality theory, which is further converted to a mixed integer convex quadratic programming problem by a linearization method, which can be easily solved to obtain the robust solution with a good performance for any value of uncertain parameters. Finally, some numerical experiments are conducted to verify the validity of the presented optimization model in improving the stability of the bus headway.}

Urban airspace is full of intrinsic risks associated with several factors, including but not limited to unpredictable microclimates, radio-frequency disturbances and electro-magnetic interferences. For safe and efficient use of airspace, it is imperative to proactively assess the availability of airspace volumes to accommodate large-scale operations. In this paper, we highlight that urban airspace is a unique environment where highly obstructed (complex topology) and sparsely structured (simple topology) regions coexist. The presence of static obstacles and required separation from those obstacles create particular spatial structures, such as narrow passages, islands and funnels, throughout the airspace. Considering that not only throughput capacity of airspace but also complexity of path planning is highly dependent on the topology of a navigable space, we propose a new airspace assessment approach to extract the topology of airspace using computational geometry techniques. We focus on identifying geospatial locations suitable for high density UAS operations as well as examining spatial contiguity between those locations in highly urbanized areas. In doing so, we define segment as an airspace region that is wide enough for multiple vehicles to simultaneously pass through. Low-altitude urban airspace is abstracted into a compact and informative graph structure called segment graph that summarizes segment connectivity in the horizontal and vertical dimension. The proposed method shows that the geometry of low-altitude airspace is fundamentally different from that of conventional high-altitude airspace and can provide a useful basis for airspace design and management within low-altitude urban environments.}

abstract = {The advent of smart cities has motivated the field of transportation safety to transition towards a proactive approach that anticipates and mitigates risks before crashes occur. One of the stepping-stones to complete this transition is to monitor the risk levels of the transportation roadway system continuously. With the advancement in emerging technologies, computer-vision-based safety analysis approaches that focus on risk assessment using traffic conflicts quantified by surrogate safety measures extracted from traffic videos have been proposed. As the detailed movements of all the vehicles are logged in the video data, the quantified traffic conflicts can depict the whole picture of risk levels for a specific location. However, the capability of using traffic videos and the quantified traffic conflicts for proactive safety monitoring has yet to be investigated widely. In addition, one of the limitations of past safety research is that safety-related data are mostly aggregated into summary statistics (such as the total number of crashes/conflicts), which constitutes a major simplification of the real risk levels that change over time. Therefore, this study contributes to the literature by proposing a novel functional approach that models time series of a variant of the time exposed time-to-collision safety indicator directly to detect safety-related anomalies from traffic video data. Functional data smoothing methods that can mitigate overfitting and account for the nonnegative characteristics of safety indicator are applied. Nine commonly used functional anomaly detection methods are summarized and compared using approximately one-hour of traffic video data recorded by an unmanned aerial vehicle at a signalized intersection. Ground truth safety-related anomalies are identified by manually reviewing the video data, which is used to validate the performances of anomaly detection methods. Good separation between safety-related anomalies and non-anomalies (0.85 area under the receiver operating characteristics and 0.8 area under the precision-recall curve) has been found. By applying the proposed safety-related anomaly detection method, significant amount of human resources can be liberated.}

However, when congestion is low, the ridesourcing market must be subsidized due to low marginal costs of operation. This mirrors previous findings in the traditional taxi literature. We also demonstrate that a commission cap on the solo service combined with a congestion toll (however small) on ridesourcing vehicles can induce any desired, sustainable equilibrium under the assumption of homogeneous value of travel time and sufficient supply of homogeneous drivers. Furthermore, numerical experiments suggest that the most important problem that a regulator should address when faced with a monopoly may not be that of congestion but rather that of market power. Indeed, when congestion is high, similar to previous findings in the literature, decisions by the monopolist tend to mirror that of the regulator. This is because customers on the platform must also bear the congestion cost, which hurts the platform’s revenues. Additionally, numerical examples reveal that, even when accounting for heterogeneity in the value of travel time, the commission cap is able to achieve the second-best–whether combined with a toll or not. This confirms the effectiveness of the commission cap strategy illustrated in previous literature and provides decision makers with a simple, non-intrusive mechanism for regulating the market.}

abstract = {Ride-hailing platforms generally provide various service options to customers, such as solo ride services, shared ride services, etc. It is generally expected that demands for different service modes are correlated, and the prediction of demand for one service mode can benefit from historical observations of demands for other service modes. Moreover, an accurate joint prediction of demands for multiple service modes can help the platforms better allocate and dispatch vehicle resources. Although there is a large stream of literature on ride-hailing demand predictions for one specific service mode, few efforts have been paid towards joint predictions of ride-hailing demands for multiple service modes. To address this issue, we propose a deep multi-task multi-graph learning approach, which combines two components: (1) multiple multi-graph convolutional (MGC) networks for predicting demands for different service modes, and (2) multi-task learning modules that enable knowledge sharing across multiple MGC networks. More specifically, two multi-task learning structures are established. The first one is the regularized cross-task learning, which builds cross-task connections among the inputs and outputs of multiple MGC networks. The second one is the multi-linear relationship learning, which imposes a prior tensor normal distribution on the weights of various MGC networks. Although there are no concrete bridges between different MGC networks, the weights of these networks are constrained by each other and subject to a common prior distribution. Evaluated with the for-hire-vehicle datasets in Manhattan, we show that our proposed approach outperforms the benchmark algorithms in prediction accuracy for different ride-hailing modes.}

We show how to maximize the number of cars in a parking lot that assumes interfering cars could be moved out of the way by a centralized controller. We provide optimal results for small lots with a single entry point, and we offer heuristic methods for larger lots. Improvements in parking capacity of 80 percent is possible.}

Existing research mostly focused on fully-autonomous scenarios, while the potential of CAV control at a mixed traffic intersection where human-driven vehicles (HDVs) also exist has been less explored. This paper proposes a notion of “1+n” mixed platoon, consisting of one leading CAV and n following HDVs, and formulates a platoon-based optimal control framework for CAV control at a signalized intersection. Based on the linearized dynamics model of the “1+n” mixed platoon, fundamental properties including stability and controllability are under rigorous theoretical analysis. Then, a constrained optimal control framework is established, aiming at improving the global traffic efficiency and fuel consumption at the intersection via direct control of the CAV. A hierarchical event-triggered algorithm is also designed for practical implementation of the optimal control method between adjacent mixed platoons when approaching the intersection. Extensive numerical simulations at multiple traffic volumes and market penetration rates validate the greater benefits of the mixed platoon based method, compared with traditional trajectory optimization methods for one single CAV.}

This study examines the competitive perspective where both AV and PT operators are profit-oriented with dynamic adjustable supply strategies under five regulatory structures regarding whether the AV operator is allowed to change the fleet size and whether the PT operator is allowed to adjust headway. Four out of the five scenarios are constrained competition while the other one focuses on unconstrained competition to find the Nash Equilibrium. We evaluate the competition process as well as the system performance from the standpoints of four stakeholders—the AV operator, the PT operator, passengers, and the transport authority. We also examine the impact of PT subsidies on the competition results including both demand-based and supply-based subsidies. A heuristic algorithm is proposed to update supply strategies for AV and PT based on the operators’ historical actions and profits. An agent-based simulation model is implemented in the first-mile scenario in Tampines, Singapore. We find that the competition can result in higher profits and higher system efficiency for both operators compared to the status quo. After the supply updates, the PT services are spatially concentrated to shorter routes feeding directly to the subway station and temporally concentrated to peak hours. On average, the competition reduces the travel time of passengers but increases their travel costs. Nonetheless, the generalized travel cost is reduced when incorporating the value of time. With respect to the system efficiency, the bus supply adjustment increases the average vehicle load and reduces the total vehicle kilometers traveled measured by the passenger car equivalent (PCE), while the AV supply adjustment does the opposite. The results suggest that PT should be allowed to optimize its supply strategies under specific operation goals and constraints, and AV operations should be regulated to reduce their system impacts, including potentially limiting the number of licenses, operation time, and service areas, which makes AV operate in a manner more complementary to the PT system. Providing subsidies to PT results in higher PT supply, profit, and market share, lower AV supply, profit, and market share, and increased passenger’s generalized cost and total system PCE.}

Here, passengers continue their journey using traditional forms of public transport. On the one hand, on-demand feeder services have been a topic of discussion in a number of recent studies, since these services can serve the demand efficiently. On the other hand, traditional feeder services with predetermined routes and timetables provide predictability and easier cost control. In this paper, a demand-responsive feeder service is considered, which combines positive characteristics of both traditional services as well as on-demand-only services. This feeder service has mandatory bus stops which are always serviced, as well as optional bus stops which are only serviced when there is demand for transportation nearby. To optimize the performance of this feeder service, a large neighborhood search heuristic is developed. Experimental results on 14 benchmark instances illustrate that the LNS algorithm obtains solutions with an average gap of 1\% or less compared to the optimal solution, within 1s of runtime. Larger instances can also be solved, typically in less than 60s. The results also show that the demand-responsive feeder service generally outperforms a traditional service in terms of service quality, often by more than 60\%.}

abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to improve traffic throughput near diverge and weave bottlenecks in mixed traffic with human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and connected automated vehicles (CAVs). This is done by the strategic assignment of CAVs across lanes. The main principle is to induce strategic and necessary lane changes (LCs) (by CAVs and HDVs) well upstream of the potential bottleneck, so that the traffic flow approaching the bottleneck is organized and exhibits fewer throughput-reducing LCs at the bottleneck. A hybrid approach is used to investigate the problem: macroscopic analytical approach to formulate lane assignment strategies, and numerical simulations to quantify the improvements in throughput for various scenarios. Several strategies are formulated considering various operational conditions for each bottleneck type. Furthermore, compensatory behaviour of HDVs in response to the flow/density imbalance created by the CAV lane assignment is explicitly accounted for in our framework. Evaluation by numerical simulations demonstrates significant benefits of the proposed method, even at low to moderate CAV penetration rates: they can lead to an increase of throughput by several percent, thereby decreasing delays significantly.}

This study examines consumers’ consideration to adopt AVs, with a particular focus on the impact of informational cues from different communication channels. Data for our analysis is collected through an online survey conducted in December 2019, and our sample comprises 862 residents from Sydney, Australia. The survey asks respondents about their social networks, and their use of different mass and social media platforms. Respondents are subsequently presented a discrete choice experiment where we systematically vary informational cues about AVs from each of these communication channels, and respondents are asked to indicate their willingness to consider AVs under each scenario. This data is used to develop a latent class choice model of AV consideration as a function of the informational cues received from different communication channels. Our model also considers the level of trust that respondents associate with their social contacts when modelling the effect of word-of-mouth from these social contacts. The results reveal eleven segments in the sample that differ from one another in terms of sociodemographic attributes, evaluation of social contact trust, and the relative importance they attach to different communication channels. The findings show social media sentiment has the highest effect on AV consideration for 90 per cent of the sample. Also 3.8 per cent of the sample never consider adopting AVs, regardless of the informational cues.}

However, the multi-dimensional nature of these data makes it challenging to compare activity-travel patterns and identify clusters of individuals with similar patterns and use them to study behaviors and forecast travel demands. To address this challenge, we adopt a discrete, step-based view on time and transform the episodic-based diary into a sequence of states observed at a sample interval. The resulting sequences can visually characterize variations in activity-travel patterns across days of a week and among different individuals. Motivated by techniques in genomics and data science, we apply sequence alignment methods to measure the pairwise similarity between these activity-trip sequences. To address its practical implementation in transportation studies, we define and compare four weighting schemas: (1) the unit-cost distance, which assigns equal weights to all substitution operations between states; (2) the fixed-flexible weighted distance based on the time geography framework, where costs differ for substitutions involving fixed and flexible activities; (3) the trip-activity weighted distance considering travel as a derived demand, where costs differ for substitutions between trips and activities; and (4) transition-based weighted distance, where costs are based on the global or time-varying activity and trip transition rates estimated from the data. Then, we calculate the pairwise distances between individuals’ sequences and use them as inputs to a hierarchical clustering algorithm to group individuals with similar sequences. We visualize the state distributions of the identified clusters to infer and compare behavior patterns, and use functional data regression methods to estimate the time-dependent probabilities of engaging in various activities and trips. To demonstrate our methods, we analyze a smartphone-based survey dataset collected in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. We also conduct sensitivity analysis on the selection of cost metrics and sample intervals to ensure the robustness of our methods and discuss their implications in practice. By identifying population subgroups with distinct daily activity-travel patterns and explaining how these patterns vary over one day and depend on user profiles, our weighted sequence alignment approach provides an intuitive and flexible method for extracting and characterizing individuals’ activity-travel behaviors for use in transportation planning.}

This paper investigates the welfare effects of inaccurate pre-trip information on commuters’ departure time choice under stochastic bottleneck capacity in the morning commute. Three cases concerning commuters’ actions in response to inaccurate pre-trip information, namely compliance, noncompliance, and co-existence, are studied. We consider two types of traffic conditions: good conditions and bad conditions, as well as errors in forecasting good conditions and bad conditions, respectively. We derive all theoretical solutions under different magnitudes of forecast errors, and frequency and severity of bottleneck capacity reductions in the compliance and noncompliance cases, and adopt an iterative algorithm to obtain the departure flow patterns in the co-existence case. Our results show that the benefits of inaccurate information depend on information quality, commuters’ response and heterogeneity, and the frequency and severity of bottleneck capacity reductions. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to further evaluate the benefit gains/losses under different situations in the three cases.}

The capacity of congested airports is a scarce resource which is allocated in the form of slots to airlines to operate their flights. Traditionally, the optimisation of slot allocation efficiency has been considered as the primary criterion in making slot allocation decisions at capacity-constrained airports. The efficiency of slot allocation is expressed as a function of displacement, which is defined as the difference between the time requested by the airlines and the time allocated to airlines to operate their flights. Recent research work has considered fairness as an additional slot allocation objective. However, the literature has not adequately addressed the following two key research questions: i) in the presence of alternative fairness measures, which fairness measure should be used to investigate the slot allocation efficiency-fairness trade-off, and how the choice of the efficient frontier describing this trade-off should be made? and ii) given that the choice of the efficient frontier has been made, which slot allocation solution should be selected for implementation, and how this choice should be made? To address these questions, we investigate three inter-airline fairness objectives, and we introduce a decision-making framework to assist decision-makers in identifying the most preferable acceptable slot allocation outcome. The proposed decision-making framework is based on a voting mechanism which incorporates the preferences of stakeholders. We use slot request and capacity data to determine the most preferable slot allocation outcome at a capacity-constrained airport.}

We introduce a methodology to quantify the similarity of macroscopic traffic patterns. We do so by using the concepts of the MFD and a dynamic time warping (DTW) based algorithm for time series. This allows us to derive a few representative MFD clusters that capture the essential macroscopic traffic patterns. We then provide an in-depth analysis of traffic heterogeneity in the network which is indicative of the previously found clusters.

The departure times, travel routes and signal timings are optimized in central controller, while the vehicle trajectories can be optimized by distributed roadside processors, which together form a hierarchical traffic management scheme. The conventional NEMA phasing structure is applied for signal control, so that no additional safety issue needs to be considered inside crowded intersections.

To learn a better representation of the co-occurrence, we construct a bipartite graph for the Origin-Destination (OD) pair and the User-OD pair of all the query records then transformed nodes in the bipartite graph to feature vectors using a graph-embedding technique. Finally, we propose a post-processing technique to handle the inconsistency between the objective function and evaluation metric. Experimental results from a city-wide multi-modal transportation recommendation indicate that our proposed model is superior to the existing method of navigation service providers.}

abstract = {Autonomous-vehicle (AV) technologies are rapidly advancing, but a great deal remains to be learned about their interaction and perception on public roads. Research in this area usually relies on AV trials using naturalistic driving which are expensive with various legal and ethical obstacles designed to keep the general public safe. The emerging concept of Wizard-of-Oz simulation is a promising solution to this problem wherein the driver of a standard vehicle is hidden from the passenger using a physical partition, providing the illusion of riding in an AV. Furthermore, head-mounted display (HMD) virtual reality (VR) has been proposed as a means of providing a Wizard-of-Oz protocol for on-road simulations of AVs. Such systems have potential to support a variety of study conditions at low cost, enabling simulation of a variety of vehicles, driving conditions, and circumstances. However, the feasibility of such systems has yet to be shown. This study makes use of a within-subjects factorial design for examining and evaluating a virtual reality autonomous vehicle (VRAV) system, with the aim of better understanding the differences between stationary and on-road simulations, both with and without HMD VR. More specifically, this study examines the effects on user experience of conditions including presence, arousal, simulator sickness and task workload. Participants indicated a realistic and immersive driving experience as part of subjective evaluation of the VRAV system, indicating the system is a promising tool for human-automation interaction and future AV technology developments.}

In specific, we have developed and implemented a machine learning computational algorithm and built a deep neural network to determine and identify the initial impact conditions of car crash based on its final material damage state and permanently deformed structure configuration (wreckage). In this work, we have demonstrated that the developed machine learning algorithm as an inverse problem solver can accurately identify initial collision conditions in an inverse manner, which are practically unique if we use permanent plastic deformation as the forensic data signatures. In other words, we think that the massive plastic energy dissipation process and the related big data will make final structure damage state insensitive to the initial car collision conditions. Thus, it provides an inverse solution for car crash forensic analysis by reconstructing the initial failure load parameters and conditions based on the permanent plastic deformation distribution of cars. This approach has general significance in solving the inverse problem for engineering failure analysis and vehicle crashworthiness analysis, which provides a key contribution for the unmanned autonomous vehicle and the related technology.}

We first develop an equilibrium model in a homogeneous plane to capture customer behaviors, to examine the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium state, and to propose a convergent algorithm to solve the model. Then, we establish a model to formulate the optimal design of service providers on a homogeneous plane as a mixed-integer program (MIP) problem and further extend the model that enables it to solve the case with a heterogeneous plane. Numerical tests of the equilibrium model show that the algorithm can quickly converge to the equilibrium solution, and some managerial insights for the hybrid charging system design are identified from the numerical tests of the optimal design model.}

Service providers using such a model can offer a better user experience due to shorter response times, while they also benefit from the increased profits made possible by the global optimization of assignments. This study compares two immediate response strategies (IRSs) in terms of their system performance and individual ability to correctly predict customers’ pickup time windows. It also compares the key performance indicators (KPIs) of global reassignment optimization without immediate responses and several constrained cases in which customer acceptances and rejections are handled by IRSs. Ten combinations of IRSs and service model variations are tested in simulations using the ODM demand data from New York City taxis obtained over one week for varying fleet sizes of between 1,000 and 6,000 vehicles. The results show that in general, the list-based assignments (LBA) approach outperforms the nearest neighbor policy (NNP) as an IRS in most of the scenarios evaluated with respect to KPIs, such as requests served and profit generated for the service provider, while it also produces more empty vehicle mileage and longer customer waiting times. The pickup time window predictions of both LBA and NNP were correct in 68\% to 72\% of cases in scenarios in which no constraints are induced by the IRS. It was also found that global (re)optimization of assignments helps to improve the profit generated for the service provider, especially if the decision as to which requests are accepted is made during global optimization rather by the IRS. However, such a service model would imply an average customer response time of half the optimization period, which was set to 30s in this study compared to the immediate responses given when using an IRS.}

In this study, we investigate the parking choices of privately-owned AVs in a downtown area. Since each user’s choice has impacts on another via cruising-incurred traffic congestion and parking competition, we model the parking choice problem of AVs as a Wardrop equilibrium in which each user cannot further reduce their parking cost by unilaterally changing their choice. The model considers all possible options for parking a private AV, and finds that these parking choices may yield multiple equilibria under which the congestion and social welfare are very different. We further develop an efficient solution algorithm to find all equilibrium solutions. Our analysis shows that even if AVs act in a non-cooperative manner, one possible outcome would involve many AVs choosing to cruise, which creates severe congestion to decrease the cost of cruising. However, this outcome can be avoided by a time-based congestion toll, which discourages AVs from cruising for a long period and increases the social welfare. Our analysis also shows parking pricing and provision may not reduce congestion induced by cruising AVs without the help of a congestion toll.}

This study investigates the preferences of urban rail/rapid transit users for first- and last-mile AV services, which are not well understood. First, it develops an access mode choice model incorporating on-demand transit access enabled by AVs. Second, the model is estimated with stated choice data obtained from a survey of 2,300 residents living within 1–5 km of their nearest rail stations in the Tokyo metropolitan area, in which choice tasks are based on recent access to home-end stations. Finally, estimated models are used to compute elasticities of demand for access modes with respect to AV cost and wait time. The results show that price sensitivities of demand for AV services lie within a reasonable range of transit fare elasticities. AVs have diverse substitution patterns with existing modes. Riding in AV services is more likely to be a substitute for riding on buses/in slower modes of transit for all travel purposes, and for driving cars, particularly for leisure trips, but less likely for cycling and walking, particularly for work trips. The AV wait time elasticities might vary according to the waiting environment and conditions. The results also suggest that AVs may particularly benefit those who currently have restrictions in accessing transit.}

Although there has been a proliferation of approaches that attempt to detect the occurrence times and locations of traffic crashes, most, if not all, of them typically manipulate the crashes singly when there are multiple crashes. In this research, we propose a new approach that can detect the occurrence times and locations of multiple crashes simultaneously. We first construct the speed contour plot using probe vehicle data on candidate links. We then formulate the detection process as an integer programming model and develop a set of novel constraints to estimate the spatiotemporal impact regions associated with multiple crashes by leveraging the spatiotemporal propagation of congestion. We subsequently take the time and location when the travel speed begins to drop in each impact region as the occurrence time and location of each corresponding crash. Finally, we validate our model using real data in Beijing and find that our model can handle the situation where multiple crashes are incorporated in the speed contour plot. Besides, our model can reduce the average time and location bias by 79.52\% and 81.29\%, respectively.}

In this study, we introduce a holding criterion for network configurations with lines that operate jointly along a common corridor and then diverge to individual branches serving different urban areas. The proposed holding decision rule accounts for all different passenger groups in the overlapping segment and considers the transition to individual line operation. The holding rule is evaluated using simulation for different demand levels and compositions and is compared with state-of-the-art control schemes for a real-world network. Results show that the proposed multi-line control yields performance improvements along the shared transit corridor as well as at the line level. The performance of the control scheme is affected by the demand composition and we provide indications regarding the conditions under which multi-line control is advisable.}

This study aims to optimize the maintenance schedules for both train operators and maintenance contractors, by considering (a) hindrance for parked passenger trains and planned freight trains, and (b) the workload for track workers. Further, maintenance operations are distinguished into different engineering fields (switches, straight tracks, and overhead wiring) since this influences the amount of hindrance. The method presented for designing maintenance schedules is a novel mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model that considers these aspects. In our Dutch case study, we assess our new scheduling model and show that large improvements can be made in terms of mean workload for work crews and total hindrance for train operators.

From traffic monitoring at the city scale, to commuters in train terminals, recent progress in sensing technology make it possible to use cameras to better understand the demand, i.e., better track moving agents (e.g., vehicles and pedestrians). Whether the cameras are mounted on drones, vehicles, or fixed in the built environments, they inevitably remain scatter. We need to develop the technology to re-identify the same agents across images captured from non-overlapping field-of-views, referred to as the visual re-identification task. State-of-the-art methods learn a neural network based representation trained with the cross-entropy loss function. We argue that such loss function is not suited for the visual re-identification task hence propose to model confidence in the representation learning framework. We show the impact of our confidence-based learning framework with three methods: label smoothing, confidence penalty, and deep variational information bottleneck. They all show a boost in performance validating our claim. Our contribution is generic to any agent of interest, i.e., vehicles or pedestrians, and outperform highly specialized state-of-the-art methods across 6 datasets.

However, the current research focus is still mainly on traditional parcel delivery and little is known for food and grocery deliveries and their impacts on transportation systems. To have a better understanding of deliveries and their impacts on transportation systems, using the survey data from NYC DOT Citywide Mobility Survey in 2018, this paper investigated (a) factors affecting the three types of deliveries (retail, grocery, and food) by developing a seemingly unrelated model, and (b) the relationships between deliveries and in-store shopping trips by different modes using multiple simultaneous equations models. The results showed that factors affecting deliveries vary by the type of delivery, and the three deliveries are positively correlated by common unobserved factors. In addition, the relationships between delivery and shopping trip vary not only by delivery type but also by trip mode (driving/walking). The findings would provide valuable insights into travel demand modeling and curbside management.}

While the accumulation-based MFD assumes a low-scatter, non-linear relationship between region production and accumulation, the outflow relationship in formulating dynamics of multi-region networks requires simplifying assumptions. The existing perimeter control methods are grounded on accumulation-based MFD models where the number of transferring vehicles is approximated by the ratio of the instantaneous number of vehicles based on their destinations. Moreover, perimeter control may lead to more vehicles queuing at the region boundary (i.e. cordon queues) which add local impediments on traveling vehicles and impact the accuracy of well-defined MFDs. To address these shortcomings under time-varying conditions, this paper develops a robust perimeter control method based on the Sliding Mode Control to minimize total travel time in the entire network. To test the performance of the proposed control method, a trip-based MFD model is developed that accounts for cordon queues and various trip lengths of individual travelers. In this paper, two-region accumulation-based and trip-based MFD models are compared through numerical experiments. The results pinpoint the proposed robust perimeter control method can effectively alleviate congestion and improve network efficiency during traffic rush hours.}

Recently, DNN models such as the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) have shown remarkable success in modelling complex and noisy behavioural data. However, econometric studies have argued that machine learning techniques are a ‘black-box’ and difficult to interpret for use in the choice analysis. We develop a data-driven choice model that extends the systematic utility function to incorporate non-linear cross-effects using a series of residual layers and using skipped connections to handle model identifiability in estimating a large number of parameters. The model structure accounts for cross-effects and choice heterogeneity arising from substitution, interactions with non-chosen alternatives and other effects in a non-linear manner. We describe the formulation, model estimation, interpretability and examine the relative performance and econometric implications of our proposed model. We present an illustrative example of the model on a classic red/blue bus choice scenario example. For a real-world application, we use a travel mode choice dataset to analyze the model characteristics compared to traditional neural networks and Logit formulations. Our findings show that our ResLogit approach significantly outperforms MLP models while providing similar interpretability as a Multinomial Logit model.}

Of these, air traffic management in the multi-airport (metroplex) terminal airspace is one of the most complicated subsystems to manage, especially due to the interactions between proximal airports. Analyzing anomalous behaviors in the metroplex is emerging as a key problem in understanding air traffic management complexity and safety. Although physics-based approaches have been studied in-depth for this application, newfound interest has been observed to use recorded time-series air traffic surveillance and airport operations datasets for this purpose. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based anomaly detection algorithm that generates mathematical models to detect anomalies in metroplex operations. Several machine learning algorithms have been developed to detect anomalies using only air traffic surveillance data, but there is a significant scope of improvement by including airport operational characteristics as well, since integrating such closely-controlled metroplex operational datasets allows the developed models to effectively detect anomalies. The key contribution of this paper is in allowing anomaly detection models to recursively update so as to adapt to changes in metroplex operations. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated with real air traffic surveillance and airport operations datasets at LaGuardia, John F. Kennedy, and Newark airports, thereby detecting anomalies for operations in the New York metroplex.}

In this paper, we face the design of such a system in which users might be requested online to walk towards/from nearby pick-up/drop-off points if this improves overall efficiency. We show theoretically that the general problem becomes more complex (as it contains two sub-problems that extend set-cover), analyze the trade-offs that emerge, and provide a general formulation and specific heuristics that are able to solve it over large instances. We test this formulation over a real dataset of Manhattan taxi trips (9970 requests during one hour), finding that (a) average walks of about one minute can reduce the number of rejections in more than 80\% and Vehicles-Hour-Traveled in more than 10\%, (b) users who depart or arrive at the most demanded areas are more likely to be required to walk, and (c) the performance improvement of the service is larger when the system receives more trip requests.}

The first AV-related traffic fatalities have pushed manufacturers and regulators towards decisions about how mature AV technology should be before the cars are rolled out in large numbers. We discuss the psychological factors underlying the question of how safe AVs need to be to compel consumers away from relying on the abilities of human drivers. For consumers, how safe is safe enough? Three preregistered studies (N = 4566) reveal that the established psychological biases of algorithm aversion and the better-than-average effect leave consumers averse to adopting AVs unless the cars meet extremely potentially unrealistically high safety standards. Moreover, these biases prove stubbornly hard to overcome, and risk substantially delaying the adoption of life-saving autonomous driving technology. We end by proposing that, from a psychological perspective, the emphasis AV advocates have put on safety may be misplaced.}

It is often assumed that sufficient information on the preceding vehicle pulk is available to accurately predict the traffic situation. Because vehicle-to-vehicle communication was introduced only recently, this assumption will not be valid until a sufficiently high penetration of the vehicle fleet has been reached. Thus, in the present study, we employed Reinforcement Learning (RL) to develop eco-driving strategies for cases where little data on the traffic situation are available. An A-segment electric vehicle was simulated using detailed efficiency models to accurately determine its energy-saving potential. A probabilistic traffic environment featuring signalized urban roads and multiple preceding vehicles was integrated into the simulation model. Only information on the traffic light timing and minimal sensor data were provided to the control algorithm. A twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) agent was implemented and trained to control the vehicle efficiently and safely in this environment. Energy savings of up to 19\% compared with a simulated human driver and up to 11\% compared with a fine-tuned Green Light Optimal Speed Advice (GLOSA) algorithm were determined in a probabilistic traffic scenario reflecting real-world conditions. Overall, the RL agents showed a better travel time and energy consumption trade-off than the GLOSA reference.}

abstract = {The past decade has witnessed continuous growth of naturalistic driving studies (NDSs). When analysing NDS data, safety-critical events (SCEs) are commonly used as surrogates for safety, since actual crashes are very rare. However, the association between SCEs and crashes is not consistent in previous studies and has not been verified among commercial truck drivers. Based on routinely collected kinematic data from 31,828 truck drivers in a large commercial trucking company, this paper examines the association between four types of SCEs (headway, hard brake, collision mitigation, and rolling stability) and crashes, as well as injuries and fatalities. Compared to existing studies on the subject, that are based on up to about 2 million miles driven, our study involves an estimated 2.3 billion miles driven. Bayesian negative binomial models were applied to examine the association between three outcomes (crashes, injuries, and fatalities) and the four SCEs. It was found that a unit increase in the number of any type of SCEs per 10,000 miles was associated with 8.4\% (95\% credible interval (CI): 8.0–8.8\%) increase in crashes per mile and 8.7\% (95\% CI: 4.8–13.6\%) increase in the number of injuries per mile. The increase was different in different types of SCEs: 3.3\% (95\% CI: 2.6–4\%) for headways, 8.1\% (95\% CI: 7.5–8.7\%) for hard brakes, 50.4\% (95\% CI: 41.4–60\%) for rolling stability, and 22.2\% (95\% CI: 19.8–24.5\%) for collision mitigation. The results are consistent when stratified by different business units and driver types. This study provides statistically strong and robust evidence that SCEs are positively associated with crashes and injuries among commercial truck drivers. NDS and kinematic data routinely collected by trucking companies provide a promising opportunity for future data analytic research.}

Relevant literature has proved VMS to be effective, especially for diverting traffic during incidents in the highway or inducing a speed reduction. Previous efforts, however, usually involve off-highway experiences, including the use of simulators or stated preference surveys, or the measurement of aggregate values of traffic through technologies that are prone to a higher failure rate, such as loop detectors. For bridging this gap, in this research, we propose a novel vehicle-by-vehicle approach (VBV), that differentiate by vehicle type, to assess the impact of VMS on drivers’ road behavior patterns along a section of a Chilean urban highway during risky situations. In addition to the messaging information, we use full traffic data obtained from free-flow gates equipped with automatic vehicle identification (AVI) technology. We conduct statistical analyses to study two potential messaging-induced behavioral changes, namely speed reduction and lane changes. For the speed reduction behavior, in 87.50\% of the studied messages, the results indicate that the messages failed to induce the desired change in behavior. This value decreases to 71.85\% for lane changes. The results indicate that heavy vehicle drivers and low-mileage drivers are more likely to follow lane change messages.}

abstract = {The goal of this paper is to develop a modeling framework that captures the inter-decision dynamics between mobility service providers (MSPs) and travelers that can be used to optimize and analyze policies/regulations related to MSPs. To meet this goal, the paper proposes a tri-level mathematical programming model with a public-sector decision maker (i.e. a policymaker/regulator) at the highest level, the MSP in the middle level, and travelers at the lowest level. The public-sector decision maker aims to maximize social welfare via implementing regulations, policies, plans, transit service designs, etc. The MSP aims to maximize profit by adjusting its service designs. Travelers aim to maximize utility by changing their modes and routes. The travelers’ decisions depend on the regulator and MSP’s decisions while the MSP decisions themselves depend on the regulator’s decisions. To solve the tri-level mathematical program, the study employs Bayesian optimization (BO) within a simulation–optimization solution approach. At the lowest level, the solution approach includes an agent-based transportation system simulation model to capture travelers’ behavior subject to specific decisions made by the regulator and MSP. At the middle and highest levels, the solution approach employs BO for the MSP to maximize profit and for the regulator to maximize social welfare. The agent-based transportation simulation model includes a mode choice model, a road network, a transit network, and an MSP providing automated mobility-on-demand (AMOD) service with shared rides. The modeling and solution approaches are applied to Munich, Germany in order to validate the model. The case study investigates the tolls and parking costs the city administration should set, as well as changes in the public transport budget and a limitation of the AMOD fleet size. Best policy settings are derived for two social welfare definitions, in both of which the AMOD fleet size is not regulated as the shared-ride AMOD service provides significant value to travelers in Munich.}

To overcome bias introduced by data generated from only fitness app users, researchers build statistical models that predict total bicycling by integrating Strava data with official counts and geographic data. However, studies conducted on single cities provide limited insight on best practices for modeling bicycling with Strava as generalizability is difficult to assess. Our goal is to develop a generalized approach to modeling bicycling ridership using Strava data. In doing so we enable detailed mapping that is more inclusive of all bicyclists and will support more equitable decision-making across cities. We used Strava data, official counts, and geographic data to model Average Annual Daily Bicycling (AADB) in five cities: Boulder, Ottawa, Phoenix, San Francisco, and Victoria. Using a machine learning approach, LASSO, we identify variables important for predicting ridership in all cities, and independently in each city. Using the LASSO-selected variables as predictors in Poisson regression, we built generalized and city-specific models and compared accuracy. Our results indicate generalized prediction of bicycling ridership on a road segment in concert with Strava data should include the following variables: number of Strava riders, percentage of Strava trips categorized as commuting, bicycling safety, and income. Inclusion of city-specific variables increased model performance, as the R2 for generalized and city-specific models ranged from 0.08–0.80 and 0.68–0.92, respectively. However, model accuracy was influenced most by the official count data used for model training. For best results, official count data should capture diverse street conditions, including low ridership areas. Counts collected continuously over a long time period, rather than at peak periods, may also improve modeling. Modeling bicycling from Strava and geographic data enables mapping of bicycling ridership that is more inclusive of all bicyclists and better able to support decision-making.}

In practice, these different patterns and frequencies involve a trade-off between the user and operator requirements, and this aspect cannot be fully clarified by a single-objective optimization problem. Therefore, in this study, the LSDFSP is considered at the network level and formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem with competing objectives of minimizing the user and operator costs. The cooperative coevolutionary multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is redesigned to collaboratively optimize the service patterns and frequencies. A prioritization method is proposed to separately incorporate different types of unsatisfied demand as critical indicators, prompting the algorithm to dig deeper into valuable genes and evolve more feasible solutions. The proposed algorithm is tested on a small network and a real intricate network. It is noted that higher frequencies increased the fleet size and decreased the users’ waiting time and in-vehicle time. Furthermore, skipping more stations reduced the fleet size and users’ in-vehicle time, while increasing the users’ waiting time and number of transfers. The computational results indicated that the proposed algorithm can suitably incorporate the trade-offs and generate an accurate set of Pareto-optimal solutions.}

We use a discrete distribution to capture taste heterogeneity of distinct latent classes. Latent variables, socio-demographics and travel habits inform latent class assignment estimated simultaneously with a discrete choice kernel. Respondents chose their preferred mode for going to work in a set of stated preference choice tasks, based on the attributes of their current commutes using a Bayesian D-Efficient design. Users were segmented into two latent classes based on latent factors that capture time style orientation and public transit dislike. The effects of seating designation, not modeled previously in this context, trip cost and travel times in a shared ride, were estimated for the two classes. Users who neither like transit nor ridesharing with strangers are less likely to choose a shared ride if their designated seat is the middle seat, and overall less likely to choose automated transit. Individuals who have more organized time styles demonstrate higher marginal sensitivity to travel times and costs and are more likely to choose automated transit. Value of time analysis reveals that wait time of services that offer a convenient home pickup is valued lower than in-vehicle time. The implications for future adoption of shared automated vehicles is further discussed.}

In Japan, large-scale anomaly events such as traffic standstills that cause serious road disturbances occur frequently every year because of heavy snowfall. However, if the risk of anomaly events is known in advance, appropriate preparation and management can be undertaken to prevent such events and/or alleviate their impacts on road traffic. Therefore, this study attempts to evaluate the risk of standstills based on the degraded road performance estimated from probe vehicle speeds using sequential Bayesian filtering in a state space model (SSM). The SSM comprises a system model constructed by learning historical data and a measurement model using several exogenous variables such as snowfall amounts and temperature. The risk of anomaly events is then determined as the deviation of the filtered vehicle speed by the SSM from the statistically feasible speed distribution. The validation is performed by applying the proposed model to 58 traffic-standstill cases in northern Japan, and we confirm that the model successfully evaluates risks at a reasonable level that permits the practical use.}

UAM networks rely on an infrastructure of vertiports, which are closely tied to the ability of the UAM service to operate effectively. This research addresses identifying desirable locations for vertiports while taking into account vehicle limitations, desired operational strategies, and the possibility of passenger trips involving more than two vertiports. The vertiport selection problem is presented as a modified single-allocation p-hub median location problem that incorporates elements of subgraph isomorphism to create structured networks to allow for public transit operations. Because the problem is NP-hard, five heuristic algorithms are developed to find potential solutions with acceptable computation times. The methods are compared to the optimal solution in three different areas of the United States. The most effective of these methods are found to be within 10\% of the optimal solution on average, and results indicate that they scale well to larger networks.

Two types of bikes are considered, including usable and broken bikes. The Enhanced Artificial Bee Colony (EABC) algorithm is adopted to generate the vehicle route. Two methods, namely heuristic and exact methods, are proposed and incorporated into the EABC algorithm to compute the loading/unloading quantities at each stop. Computational experiments were conducted on the real-world instances having 10–300 stations.

This opens up the possibility for inclusion of additional information in the collaborative decision-making process. With that in mind, we define the indicator for the economic risk of network elements (e.g., sectors or airports) as the expected costs that the elements impose on airspace users due to Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) regulations. The definition of the indicator is based on the analysis of historical ATFM regulations data, that provides an indication of the risk of accruing delay. This risk of delay is translated into a monetary risk for the airspace users, creating the new metric of the economic risk of a given airspace element. We then use some machine learning techniques to find the parameters leading to this economic risk. The metric is accompanied by an indication of the accuracy of the delay–cost prediction model. Lastly, the economic risk is transformed into a qualitative economic severity classification. The economic risks and consequently economic severity can be estimated for different temporal horizons and time periods providing an indicator which can be used by Air Navigation Service Providers to identify areas which might need the implementation of strategic measures (e.g., resectorisation or capacity provision change), and by Airspace Users to consider operation of routes which use specific airspace regions.}

The primary objective is to evaluate in detail the influence of other individuals by considering how influencers and entire network structures affect one-to-one interactions. This study proposes an analytical framework for the simultaneous evaluation of local interaction and face-to-face communication network formation. This framework is appropriate for dynamic scenarios, because local interactions strongly influence human decision-making and because network formation changes over time. Our detailed local interaction model, which is based on Brock and Durlauf (2001), analyzes the differences in the interaction weights related to pairs and behaviors. We estimate the utility and the asymmetric weight parameters in the local interaction model by using the nested pseudo-likelihood approach. Our proposed network formation model, which is based on the discrete choice model, evaluates the probability of face-to-face communication and the spatial correlations of the interaction pairs in an area. Our case study validates the introduction of (1) asymmetric weights of interaction in the evacuation departure choice and (2) spatial correlation in the network formation model, using the behavioral data collected during a no-notice disaster in a devastated settlement. In numerical simulations, the proposed evaluation framework can effectively illustrate the impact of network structures on the choice probabilities influenced by interactions. Additionally, the framework is useful for evaluating the critical measures for prompt evacuation.}

We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed pricing scheme via an agent-based simulation for the Melbourne network. Results of the proposed CPV-based distance toll is compared with the flat distance-based toll and bi-direction cordon toll in terms of the network performance, behavioral changes, and social welfare improvement. Promisingly, the proposed CPV-based pricing scheme can reduce the long-distance trips (greater than10 km) inside the congested central business district by over 30\% while discourage non-commuting trips during peak hours, making more road resources available to commuting trips. Furthermore, it is found that the proposed CPV-based pricing scheme yields positive savings, where the total time savings outweigh the revenues collected, thus proving its high efficiency and desirability among all the comparative pricing schemes.}

abstract = {Many governments around the world are striving to promote the development of EVs for EV’s sustainability and efficiency. However, EVs may induce extra traffic congestion in the morning commute. To illustrate this point, we incorporate the vehicle's energy consumption (EC) into the classical morning commute model to explore the EV's influence on the morning commute. First, we study the impact of the vehicle’s EC on the waiting time in the user equilibrium (UE) state. Second, the properties of commuter’s waiting time in the traffic system with EVs and gasoline vehicles (GVs) are analyzed. Finally, two interventions are proposed to alleviate the extra traffic congestion caused by EVs. The analytical and numerical results of this study reveal that i) EVs will induce extra traffic congestion, and ii) we can apply some interventions to alleviate the side effect of EVs and reap more benefits from EVs. The conclusions indicate that some interventions should be conducted when EVs enter the traffic system, which sheds light on the policymaking for the promotion of EVs.}

The spatial features are extracted using the fast-approximate convolutions on graphs, and the temporal features are extracted using the long short-term memory network. The subsequent congestion index is the output variable. The model parameters are sequentially updated based on the recent collected data and the new predicting results. It is found that, in general, the proposed SCLN-TTF method achieves the most stable and satisfactory performance for all the selected airways. The models exhibit the best performance for the 60 min prediction time horizon in terms of MAPE, while the proposed SCLN-TTF shows superiority compared to the other benchmark methods particularly for the 10 min prediction. Then the graph convolutional network and extreme gradient boosting method are combined for high congestion index identification. The finding further confirms the superiority of the proposed method by considering both the spatial and temporal dependencies and integrating forward and backward features.}

abstract = {Unexpected disruptions occur in the railways on a daily basis, which are typically handled manually by experienced traffic controllers with the support of predefined contingency plans. When several disruptions occur simultaneously, it is rather hard for traffic controllers to make rescheduling decisions, because (1) the predefined contingency plans corresponding to these disruptions may conflict with each other and (2) no predefined contingency plan considering the combined effects of multiple disruptions is available. This paper proposes a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to reschedule the timetable in case of multiple disruptions that occur at different geographic locations but have overlapping periods and are pairwise connected by at least one train line. The dispatching measures of retiming, reordering, cancelling, adding stops and flexible short-turning are formulated in the MILP model that also considers the rolling stock circulations at terminal stations and platform capacity. We develop two approaches for rescheduling the timetable in a dynamic environment: the sequential approach and the combined approach. In the sequential approach, a single-disruption rescheduling model is applied to handle each new disruption with the last solution as reference. In the combined approach, the multiple-disruption rescheduling model is applied every time an extra disruption occurs by considering all ongoing disruptions. A rolling-horizon solution method to the multiple-disruption model has been developed to handle long multiple connected disruptions in a more efficient way. The sequential and combined approaches have been tested on real-life instances on a subnetwork of the Dutch railways with 38 stations and 10 train lines operating half-hourly in each direction. In a few cases, the sequential approach did not find feasible solutions, while the combined approach obtained the solutions for all considered cases. Besides, the combined approach was able to find solutions with less cancelled train services and/or train delays than the sequential approach. For long disruptions, the proposed rolling-horizon method was able to generate high-quality rescheduling solutions in an acceptable time.}

abstract = {Traffic congestion constitutes a major problem in urban areas. Trucks contribute to congestion and have a negative impact on the environment due to their size, slower dynamics and higher fuel consumption. The individual routing decisions made by truck drivers do not lead to system optimum operations and contribute to traffic imbalances especially in places where the volume of trucks is relatively high. In this paper, we design a coordination mechanism for truck drivers that uses pricing-and-routing schemes that can help alleviate traffic congestion in a general transportation network. We consider the user heterogeneity in Value-Of-Time (VOT) by adopting a multi-class model with stochastic Origin–Destination (OD) demands for the truck drivers. The main characteristic of the mechanism is that the coordinator asks the truck drivers to declare their desired OD pair and pick their individual VOT from a set of N available options, and guarantees that the resulting pricing-and-routing scheme is Pareto-improving, i.e. every truck driver will be better-off compared to the User Equilibrium (UE) and that every truck driver will have an incentive to truthfully declare his/her VOT, while leading to a revenue-neutral (budget balanced) on average mechanism. This approach enables us to design personalized (VOT-based) pricing-and-routing schemes. We show that the Optimum Pricing Scheme (OPS) can be calculated by solving a nonconvex optimization problem. To improve computational efficiency, we propose an Approximately Optimum Pricing Scheme (AOPS) and prove that it satisfies the aforementioned properties. Both pricing-and-routing schemes are compared to the Congestion Pricing with Uniform Revenue Refunding (CPURR) scheme through extensive simulation experiments where it is shown that OPS and AOPS achieve a much lower expected total travel time and expected total monetary cost for the users compared to the CPURR scheme, without negatively affecting the rest of the network. These results demonstrate the efficiency of personalized (VOT-based) pricing-and-routing schemes.}

AARs are dependent on selected runway configurations and both are affected by weather conditions. Although there have been studies tackling on the prediction of AARs or runway configurations or both, the prediction accuracy is relatively low and only single airport is considered. This study presents a data-driven deep-learning framework for predicting both runway configurations and AARs to support efficient air traffic management for complex multi-airport systems. The two major contributions from this work are 1) the proposed model uses assembled gridded weather forecast for the terminal airspace instead of an isolated station-based terminal weather forecast, and 2) the model captures the operational interdependency aspects inherent in the parameter learning process so that proposed modeling framework can predict both runway configuration and AARs simultaneously with higher accuracy. The proposed method is demonstrated with a numerical experiment taking three major airports in New York Metroplex as the case study. The prediction accuracy of the proposed method is compared with methods in current literature and the analysis results show that the proposed method outperforms all existing methods.}

abstract = {At the moment, urban mobility research and governmental initiatives are mostly focused on motor-related issues, e.g. the problems of congestion and pollution. And yet, we cannot disregard the most vulnerable elements in the urban landscape: pedestrians, exposed to higher risks than other road users. Indeed, safe, accessible, and sustainable transport systems in cities are a core target of the UN’s 2030 Agenda. Thus, there is an opportunity to apply advanced computational tools to the problem of traffic safety, in regards especially to pedestrians, who have been often overlooked in the past. This paper combines public data sources, large-scale street imagery and computer vision techniques to approach pedestrian and vehicle safety with an automated, relatively simple, and universally-applicable data-processing scheme. The steps involved in this pipeline include the adaptation and training of a Residual Convolutional Neural Network to determine a hazard index for each given urban scene, as well as an interpretability analysis based on image segmentation and class activation mapping on those same images. Combined, the outcome of this computational approach is a fine-grained map of hazard levels across a city, and an heuristic to identify interventions that might simultaneously improve pedestrian and vehicle safety. The proposed framework should be taken as a complement to the work of urban planners and public authorities.}

Together with estimated investments costs this can be used to produce a cost benefit analysis. An electric road is characterized by high economies of scale (high investment cost and low marginal cost) and considerable economies of scope (the benefit per kilometre electric road depends on the size of the network), implying that the market will produce a smaller network of electric roads, or charge higher prices for its use, than what is welfare optimal. For this reason, it is relevant for governments to consider investing in electric roads, making the cost-benefit analysis a key decision support. We model the behaviour of the carriers using the Swedish national freight model system, SAMGODS, determining the optimal shipment sizes and optimal transport chains, including mode and vehicle type. We find that if the user charge is set as to optimize social welfare, the revenue will not fully cover the investment cost of the electric road. If they are instead set to optimize profit, we find that the revenue will cover the costs if the electric road network is large enough. Electric roads appear to provide a cost-effective means to significantly reduce carbon emissions from heavy trucks. In a scenario where the expansion connects the three biggest cities in Sweden, emissions will be cut by one-third of the overall emissions from heavy trucks in Sweden. The main argument against a commitment to electric roads is that investment and maintenance costs are uncertain and that, in the long run, battery development or hydrogen fuel cells can reduce the benefit of such roads.}

abstract = {One-way carsharing is an alternative shared-use transportation mode that provides flexible travel accommodations for urban mobility. However, vehicle distributions can be mismatched with demand distributions because users are not required to return to their departure locations. Conventional operator-based vehicle relocation is limited by labor resources, but user-based and demand-controlled approaches can open new avenues for mitigating vehicle imbalance. This paper proposes a method for controlling demand patterns by applying measures of combinatorial monetary incentives and surcharges. A two-level nested logit model is adopted to analyze user decisions regarding the travel process in response to differentiated pricing combinations. A user choice model is aggregated and loaded into a time-space network that reveals the dynamics of the carsharing system. An optimization framework is proposed to determine the incentives and surcharges at different stations and times of day. This paper presents an algorithm for solving the proposed optimization model, as well as an example of parameter calibration and the solving process. Case analysis suggests that the proposed method can increase revenues by 22.5\% compared to a scenario without demand control and vehicle relocation policies. Comparisons suggest that the proposed demand-based control policy can achieve higher revenues than operator-based relocation, whereas operator-based relocation could satisfy greater demand.}

Their penetration rate in the fleet is constantly increasing, as well as their use, especially under freeway conditions. At the same time, limited information is openly available on how these systems actually operate and their differences depending on the vehicle manufacturer or model. This represents an important gap because as the number of ACC vehicles on the road increases, traffic dynamics on freeways may change accordingly, and new collective phenomena, which are only marginally known at present, could emerge. Yet, as ACC systems are introduced as comfort options and their operation is entirely under the responsibility of the driver, vehicle manufacturers do not have explicit requirements to fulfill nor they have to provide any evidence about their performances. As a result, any safety implication connected to their interactions with other road users escapes any monitoring and opportunity of improvement. This work presents a set of experimental car-following campaigns, providing an overview of the behavior of commercial ACC systems under different driving conditions. Furthermore, the suggestion of a unified data structure across the different tests facilitates comparison between the different campaigns, vehicles, systems and specifications. The complete data is published as an open-access database (OpenACC), available to the research community. As more test campaigns will be carried out, OpenACC will evolve accordingly. The activity is performed in the framework of the openData policy of the European Commission Joint Research Centre with the objective to engage the whole scientific community towards a better understanding of the properties of ACC vehicles in view of anticipating their possible impacts on traffic flow and prevent possible problems connected to their widespread introduction. In this light, OpenACC, over time, also aims at becoming a reference point to study if and how the parameters of such systems need to be regulated, how homogeneously they behave, how new ACC car-following models should be designed for traffic microsimulation purposes and what are the key differences between ACC systems and human drivers.}

To solve the proposed constrained optimal control problem, an analytical algorithm is given based on Pontryagin’s maximum principle. Further, local and string stability are analyzed, and sufficient conditions of stability are mathematically derived to guarantee stable control for both homogeneous and heterogenous VCTS. Numerical simulations were conducted to verify the correctness of derived sufficient stability conditions and the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy under variant maneuvers and disturbances.}

In this paper, a charging algorithm is developed to accompany a taxi service with online trip requests, which uses a private charging infrastructure for both slow and fast charging. The vehicle charging curves are assumed to be piece-wise linear functions. The proposed algorithm uses historical operation data to generate a pro-active planning that avoids queuing of vehicles. The algorithm is built upon three sequential, iterative, finite-horizon Mixed Integer Linear Programs. This iterative process, in which the three MILPs are solved sequentially, allows the current time-step to be optimized, while taking future time-steps into account. This is achieved by optimizing over multiple time-steps, but only implementing the current time-step in each iteration. The sequential aspect of the algorithm allows the vast amount of information over time and space to be exploited for charging trip decisions in real time, while maintaining a tractable computation time. The first level with the longest horizon is an aggregated, daily problem, that plans the charging duration required for the fleet. The second level has a horizon of up-to three hours and is an aggregated, zone-based problem for determining charger selection and empty vehicle relocations. The third level translates the outputs of the first two problems to executable decisions for individual vehicles based on their real-time location, state of charge, and assigned passengers. The first level is the most computationally expensive and is solved using Column Generation. The performance of the first two levels is then independent of the fleet size, which makes the algorithm highly scalable. A case study with travel data for the city of Barcelona is used to test the model. Results show that the proposed method can utilize the full capacity of the charging infrastructure, and improve the number of accepted requests by 14\% compared to employing a naive charging rule.}

Extensive experiments and ablation studies of the CGB-MAQL algorithm show its effectiveness and scalability in the synthetic road network, Monaco city and Harbin city scenarios. Results demonstrate that compared with a set of general control methods, our algorithm can better control multiple intersection cases on congestion alleviation and environmental protection.}

Intel has proposed a mathematical model called Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) to ensure AVs maintain a safe distance from surrounding vehicles, but testing has, to date, been limited. This study calibrates and evaluates the RSS model based on cut-in scenarios in which minimal time-to-collision (TTC) is less than 3 s. Two hundred cut-in events were extracted from Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study data, and the corresponding scenario information for each event was imported into a simulation platform. In each scenario, the human driver was replaced by an AV driven by the model predictive control-based adaptive cruise control (ACC) system embedded with the RSS model. The safety performance of three conditions, the human driver, RSS-embedded ACC model, and ACC-only model, were evaluated and compared. Compared to the performance of human drivers and ACC-only algorithm respectively, the RSS model increased the average TTC per event by 2.86 s and 0.94 s, shortened time-exposed TTC by 1.34 s and 0.65 s, and reduced time-integrated TTC by 0.91 s2 and 0.72 s2. These changes indicate that the RSS-embedded ACC model can improve safety performance in emergent cut-in scenarios. The RSS model can therefore be applied as a security guarantee, that is, to ensure the AV’s timely awareness and response to dangerous cut-in situations, thus mitigating potential conflict.}

abstract = {Two traffic steams merging at a mainline-ramp intersection often leads to recurrent traffic accidents, delays, oscillations and pollution. Existing literature shows that we still lack efficient methods to address this issue considering stream-wide traffic optimality, due to the model complexity and computation challenge. To make up these gaps, this study developed an event-triggered rolling horizon based systematical trajectory planning (RSTP), which expects to safely and smoothly merge two platoons (pure or mixed CAV) in a well-designed trajectory control zone at a mainline-ramp intersection. Specifically, the trajectory control zones on both mainline and ramp are divided into pre-merging, virtual-merging and post-merging subzones. The RSTP is only activated and then generates an optimal trajectory plan for the CAV platoons in the two pre-merging subzones by a mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP), when a new CAV approaches to the virtual merging subzone either on the mainline or ramp. The RSTP combined with a real-time correction mechanism enables the two platoons to smoothly merge at the end of the virtual merging subzone against certain level of disturbance, aiming to maximize stream-wide traffic performance. Using the unique features of the problem, a heuristic algorithm (MIA) is developed to efficiently solve the MINLPs. The numerical experiments built upon the NGSIM data show that the RSTP achieves expected performance under both pure CAV and CAV-HDV mixed traffic flow. The MIA can solve the MINLPs more quickly with a competitive solution quality than the existing solvers do in GAMS. The RSTP performs better under a traffic flow with higher CAV penetration. The real time re-planning mechanism works effectively to correct mild trajectory deviation occurring to a few CAVs.}

abstract = {Lane changing dynamics are an important part of traffic microsimulation and are vital for modeling weaving sections and merge bottlenecks. However, there is often much more emphasis placed on car following and gap acceptance models, whereas lane changing dynamics such as tactical, cooperation, and relaxation models receive comparatively little attention. This paper develops a general relaxation model which can be applied to an arbitrary parametric or nonparametric microsimulation model. The relaxation model modifies car following dynamics after a lane change, when vehicles can be far from equilibrium. Relaxation prevents car following models from reacting too strongly to the changes in space headway caused by lane changing, leading to more accurate and realistic simulated trajectories. We also show that relaxation is necessary for correctly simulating traffic breakdown with realistic values of capacity drop.}

abstract = {Compared to human-driven vehicles (HDVs), connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can drive closer to each other to enhance link capacity. Thereby, they have great potential to mitigate traffic congestion. However, the presence of HDVs in mixed traffic can significantly reduce the effects of CAVs on link capacity, especially when the proportion of HDVs is high. To address this problem, this study seeks to control the HDV flow using the autonomous vehicle/toll (AVT) lanes introduced by Liu and Song (2019). The AVT lanes grant free access to CAVs while allowing HDVs to access by paying a toll. To find the optimal toll rates for the AVT lanes to improve the network performance, first, this study proposes a multiclass traffic assignment problem with elastic demand (MTA-ED problem) to estimate the impacts of link tolls on equilibrium flows. It not only enhances behavioral realism for modeling the route choices of HDV and CAV travelers by considering their knowledge level of traffic conditions but also captures the elasticity of both HDV and CAV demand in response to the changes in the level of service induced by the tolls on AVT lanes. Thereby, it better estimate the equilibrium network flows after the tolls are deployed. Then, two categories of optimal toll design problems are formulated according to whether the solution of the HDV route flows, CAV link flows and corresponding origin–destination demand of the proposed MTA-ED problem is unique or not. To solve these optimal toll design problems, this study proposes a revised method of feasible direction. It linearizes the anonymous terms in the upper-level problem by leveraging the analytical sensitivity analysis results of the lower-level MTA-ED problem. This algorithm is globally convergent on the condition that the MTA-ED problem has a unique solution. It can also be leveraged to solve optimal toll design problems when the MTA-ED problem has multiple solutions. Numerical application found that due to disruptive effects on link capacity, using HDVs may significantly reduce the network performance such as customer surplus and total travel demand. The proposed method can assist different stakeholders to find the optimal toll rates for HDVs on AVT lanes to maximize the network performance under mixed traffic environments.}

In particular, for wide roads, the characteristics of high-density regimes in the fundamental diagram have not been well addressed, and the emergence of stop-and-go waves has not been fully understood. This study experimentally investigated bicycle flow dynamics on wide roads, using two types of 3-m-wide track. Different riding behaviors, namely, free riding, following, and overtaking, were analyzed. The bicycle flow dynamics were found to be essentially the same on the two tracks: (i) The bicycle flow rate remained nearly constant across a wide range of densities, in marked contrast to the single-file bicycle flow, which exhibited a unimodal fundamental diagram. By studying the weight density of the radial and lateral locations of cyclists, we argue that this behavior arises from the formation of more lanes with increase in global density. The newly formed lanes prevented the flow rate from decreasing. (ii) When the density exceeded 0.5 bicycles/m2, the flow rate began to decrease, and stop-and-go traffic emerged. Based on these behavioral observations, we propose an improved heuristic-based model to simulate bicycle flow on roads of different radii and explicitly account for the centrifugal effect of bicycles. The calibration and validation results demonstrate that the proposed model can reproduce the traffic dynamics of bicycle flow.}

To overcome the problem, operators have adopted a common strategy to relocate vehicles among stations by dispatchers. However, along with this approach come imbalanced dispatchers, demanding double-balanced optimization for relocation operations in vehicle relocation and dispatcher scheduling. In this paper, we propose an integrated model to determine the optimal requests served, relocation tasks, and dispatchers’ routes in order to minimize the generalized daily operational cost. The model adopts two different time granularities to obtain all the possible relocation tasks and the refined scheduling of dispatchers. Due to the dynamic nature and the scale of this double-balanced relocation problem, a hybrid solution algorithm is designed combining a rolling horizon algorithm with a customized decomposition algorithm. The planning horizon consists of several stages, each of which contains a sub-problem for the double-balanced relocation, and a customized decomposition is embedded to optimize it efficiently. Some computational experiments and a case study in Lanzhou, China are conducted to identify critical parameters and illustrate the performance of the proposed method.}

However, the negative land use effect caused by this policy could not be ignored. How to design the optimal congestion toll that can not only ensure its positive effect on the transportation system but also reduce its negative effect on land use is an urgent problem to be solved. Given this, this paper proposed a multi-objective bi-level programming road congestion pricing model based on the integrated land use and transportation model to optimize the regional average accessibility, regional average land use diversity, and regional total flow time. Since the proposed problem is NP-hard, this paper innovatively proposed an active learning optimization algorithm based on multi-objective Bayesian optimization, which improves the computation efficiency of the bi-level programming model by automatically finding the next sampling point (candidate solution) according to the probability information. An empirical analysis of Jiangyin City demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach in coordinating the relationship between land use and transportation and alleviating the negative land use effect caused by road congestion pricing. Moreover, the algorithm proposed in this paper can also be used to solve other transportation-related black box problems with high computation complexity.}

It is the first-of-its-kind survey paper to comprehensively review literature in both transportation engineering and AI for mixed traffic modeling. We will discuss state-of-the-art applications of AI-guided methods, identify opportunities and obstacles, and raise open questions. We divide the stage of AV deployment into four phases: the pure HVs, the HV-dominated, the AV-dominated, and the pure AVs. This paper is primarily focused on the latter three phases. Models used for each phase are summarized, encompassing game theory, deep (reinforcement) learning, and imitation learning. While reviewing the methodologies, we primarily focus on the following research questions: (1) What scalable driving policies are to control a large number of AVs in mixed traffic comprised of human drivers and uncontrollable AVs? (2) How do we estimate human driver behaviors? (3) How should the driving behavior of uncontrollable AVs be modeled in the environment? (4) How are the interactions between human drivers and autonomous vehicles characterized? We also provide a list of public datasets and simulation software related to AVs. Hopefully this paper will not only inspire our transportation community to rethink the conventional models that are developed in the data-shortage era, but also start conversations with other disciplines, in particular robotics and machine learning, to join forces towards creating a safe and efficient mixed traffic ecosystem.}

Through the large and heterogeneous amount of car sharing usage data that is now available, researchers have been able to gain new insights into these services. In this paper, we provide an extensive characterization of the Free-Floating Car Sharing (FFCS) service usage in 23 cities in Europe and North America over a 14-month period. From our data about FFCS services, we detail fleet size, operating area, and characteristics of the car bookings and rentals. We also identify temporal patterns that are peculiar to specific cities and countries. We further highlight urban zones with high attractiveness or with a high rental generation rate. Finally, we compare the systems relying on internal combustion engine cars with those based on electric vehicles in terms of various indicators, including the influence on car refueling. The results show that car utilization patterns are rather variable across cities with the highest per-car utilization rate in Madrid. The majority of the cities show negative or stable usage trends due to either the reduced appeal of the service or the presence of inefficiencies in the service provision. These data-driven insights may help system managers assess the provided services’ profitability and sustainability from multiple perspectives.}

This paper focuses on a train rescheduling problem for handling large disruptions, such as a rolling stock breakdown leading to a cancelled train service, where passenger reassignment strategies have to be considered. A novel mixed-integer linear programming formulation is established with consideration of train retiming, reordering, rerouting, and reservicing (addition of extra stops). The proposed mathematical formulation considers planning extra stops for non-canceled trains in order to transport the disrupted passengers, which were supposed to travel on the canceled train, to their pre-planned destination stations. Other constraints deal with limited seat capacity and track capacity, and mapping train rescheduling with passenger reassignment. A bi-objective function is optimized by a weighted-sum method to maximize the number of disrupted passengers reaching their destination stations and to minimize the weighted total train delay for all non-canceled trains at their destinations. A series of numerical experiments based on a part of the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway line is carried out to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model and to perform a sensitivity analysis of various performance factors. The results show that an optimal reassignment plan of disrupted passengers is important to achieve real-time efficiency of traffic and re-ticketing. The impact of passenger reassignment on train rescheduling is influenced by the weights for objectives, duration of disruption, allowed additional dwell and running times, and relationship between passenger demand and total available train capacity.}

We propose a binary quadratic program that determines where (by location visit tasks) and when (in shifts) to send enforcement resources (operators and equipment) over a month-long schedule. The aim of this program is to minimize violations of enforcement time halos (and thus, efficiency losses) in attaining traffic-safety focused program goals. We solved this problem using a combined Dantzig-Wolfe and column generation optimization approach, after exploring several different types of commonly-used solution methods. The model is applied to a currently operational MPE program in the City of Edmonton, Canada. Using a five-day enforcement time halo, we find that our model results improve resource utilization by 24\% over historical program deployment. The scheduling model is the final step of a larger unified MPE program framework that systematically and efficiently connects high-level urban traffic safety goals down shift-level allocations of highly limited enforcement resources. It provides a data-driven and transparent framework that both contributes to cities’ pursuits of Vision Zero and combatting negative public perceptions of MPE programs. Additionally, the framework can be easily adapted for, and transferred to, other automated traffic enforcement technologies across jurisdictions.}

abstract = {Rapid measurements of large-scale pavement roughness have long been a hot topic in pavement condition evaluation and maintenance. Most traditional methods rely on dedicated devices, such as laser, Lidar and so on, which should be set up on customized vehicles. With the rapid development of sensing technology, vehicles owned by the general public are empowered with the ability to collect vibration measurements themselves. This crowdsourced dataset is convenient, extensive coverage, inexpensive, and has high sampling frequency, making it a suitable source for large-scale pavement roughness evaluation. However, vehicle information is missing for these data due to privacy protection, which renders them quite difficult to directly use with traditional model-based methods. Thus, in this paper, we propose a semi-supervised learning (SSL) model to deal with the problem of incomplete data and multi-vehicle data fusion. A mathematical derivation of the ‘international roughness index’ (IRI) using in-car vibrations is established. Furthermore, given the multi-vehicle scenario, a self-training model is designed to iteratively estimate IRIs in a roadway network. Both the confidences of the vehicle parameters and IRI estimation are considered in the algorithm to improve its reliability and robustness. A full-car simulation model is constructed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results show that the overall relative error is less than 10\% for 50 road sections in the network, which is a significant improvement compared to traditional multi-vehicle average models. The errors of the SSL model are found to be significantly dependent on the iteration order. Based on the proposed model, the coupled impact of the sampling rate and vehicle quantity on the model’s accuracy is further discussed. The proposed approach provides new insights into large-scale pavement roughness measurements.}

At roundabouts, Autonomous and Connected Vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to enhance traffic operations, minimizing lost time and providing higher capacities by improving the gap acceptance process. This research aims to take advantage of those evolving technologies in order to design a more efficient traffic management system for single-lane roundabouts. Such a system would provide optimal coordination of CAVs to negotiate the roundabout, maximizing throughput and minimizing average control delay. The expert system developed and tested (Roundabout Manager) acts as a central controller and manages conflicts within the roundabout. It prioritizes incoming vehicles based on demand-dependent strategies and adjusts their trajectories accounting for the geometry of the roundabout. Seven strategies are proposed to coordinate CAV trajectories. The first strategy prioritizes incoming vehicles based on their Shortest-Remaining-Time-First (SRTF, i.e., the shortest time till the vehicle reaches the first conflict section it will encounter) to the conflict sections within the circular roadway, while the other strategies add to the SRTF rules to accommodate highly unbalanced traffic flows, with heavy right- or left-turning maneuvers. To illustrate the operation of the algorithm and assess its effectiveness as a function of the demand distribution, a total of 15 oversaturated demand scenarios with 10 replications per scenario were simulated for each of the seven strategies examined. It was concluded that, under any of the strategies proposed, the system guarantees higher throughput with lower average control delay compared to conventional vehicles’ operation. The capacity of the roundabout under fully CAVs traffic flow is increased by 58 to 73\% (from low to high conflicting flow, respectively). The strategy that prioritizes vehicles that have to travel through more conflict points and those that leave the system first outperforms the other strategies at all demand scenarios, becoming the optimal coordination of CAVs at roundabouts. This strategy reduces the average control delay between 80 and 97\% compared to traffic with conventional vehicles, as assessed using the Highway Capacity Manual procedures.}

abstract = {Driver trust has a great impact on the intention to accept, use, and adapt to automated vehicles. To date, driver trust in automated vehicle technologies has mostly been estimated by subjective data. Currently available objective measures of driver trust primarily rely on self-reported ratings as the ground truth, while the largely reported inconsistency between drivers’ self-reported trust levels and observed actual behavior suggests that drivers’ trust measures shall not solely rely on subjective reporting values. To address the issue, this study proposes an objective method to assess and predict driver trust in automated vehicle technologies, by using the transition probability matrix of drivers’ hand positions during automated vehicle system engagement. An on-road experiment was conducted on public roadways in real traffic. Data on use frequencies of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and self-reported trust ratings were collected and combined in classifying driver trust levels: lower, medium, and higher based on the K-means clustering results. Drivers’ hand positions during ADAS engagement (i.e., during lane-departure warning and lane-keeping assist system uses) were then found closely associated with their trust levels. Differences of frequencies and transition probabilities for hand positions were further compared within and across the three trust groups. Results showed that drivers from the lower, medium, and higher trust groups were more likely to keep hands on the top, mid, and low positions of the wheel, respectively. Factors affecting driver trust in automated vehicle technologies were also explored through mixed model analyses. Middle-aged drivers placed more trust in ADAS than younger drivers, while female drivers exhibited greater trust than male drivers. The Random Forests algorithm was applied to build a prediction model for driver trust in automated vehicle technologies, by inputting the hand position transition probability matrix, age, gender, and ADAS types as independent variables. The overall prediction accuracy was approximately 80\%. Findings in this study could contribute to the objective and real-time estimations of driver trust in automated vehicle technologies.}

abstract = {Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are expected to improve both traffic safety and efficiency by reducing the human driver errors. Recently, many researchers have focused on the simulation-based studies in order to evaluate the benefits of CAVs due to the lack of real-world data. However, none of the previous studies have attempted to differentiate the benefits of CAVs over automated vehicles (AVs) by incorporating multiple preceding vehicle information (i.e., acceleration, position, etc.). This paper aims to fill the existing gap by utilizing separate car-following models for both CAVs and AVs in order to approximate their driving behavior in the Aimsun Next simulation platform. Additionally, a different car-following model is used for the connected vehicles (CVs) without automation by addressing the human driver compliance factor. This study also utilizes mixed penetration of CAV and CV with no automation. A well calibrated and validated simulation testbed is developed for SR417 in Orlando, Florida which is the base scenario in this study. To this end, the impact of CAVs, AVs, and CVs are evaluated based on both traffic efficiency (i.e., travel time) and safety (i.e., traffic conflicts) under various market penetration rates (MPRs). The traffic efficiency results show that travel time is significantly reduced for any MPRs of CAVs, AVs, and the mixture of CVs and CAVs compared to the base scenario. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) model is developed to quantify the travel time improvement for CAVs, AVs, and the mixture of CVs and CAVs. The results suggest at least 20\% penetration is required for CAVs to get travel time improvement while 40\% penetration is needed for AVs. Also, CAV significantly outperforms AV for the same MPRs. For the safety assessment, traffic conflicts are estimated by using different surrogate measures i.e., time-to-collision (TTC) and time exposed time-to-collision (TET). The results imply that crash risk is significantly reduced for CAVs, AVs, and the mixture of CVs and CAVs scenarios compared to the base condition. A Bayesian zero-inflated negative binomial model is developed in order to model the number of traffic conflicts as a function of MPRs of CAVs, AVs, mixture of CVs and CAVs, and traffic parameters. The results confirm that CAVs are more efficient in reducing crash risk compared to AVs for the same MPR. The mix penetration rate of CV (60\%) and CAV (20\%) shows almost similar reduction of crash risk with the 80\% MPR of AV. Also, crash risk analysis based on different vehicle types shows that CAVs driving behavior is safer compared to the AVs. Finally, the results of this study indicate a significant improvement of both traffic efficiency and safety by implementing CAV with multivehicle communication system on the freeway segments.}

A key objective of the trial is to assess interest in various MaaS subscription plans through bundling public transport, ride share, car share and car rental with varying financial discounts and monthly subscription fees, in contrast to pay as you go (PAYG). This paper develops a mixed logit choice model to investigate the participants’ choice between PAYG and four subscription plans (or bundles) that were incrementally introduced over a 5-month period. This is the first paper to model real uptake as previous studies are based on stated preference data. New evidence is provided on what role financial savings, estimated using tracking technology embedded in the MaaS app, play in the context of modal offerings and a monthly subscription fee as well as socio-demographic and seasonal effects. Behaviourally, we present evidence on the extent of take up of each bundle relative to PAYG as well as elasticity estimates for all exogenous influences and estimates of willingness to pay and scenario assessment, particularly for how much someone would have to save over a previous month’s cost outlay to be willing to subscribe to a particular bundle in a subsequent month. Within the context of the trial, the findings suggest a substantial market for mobility bundles but PAYG is an option preferred by many, particularly those with varying travel needs. We are, however, not in a position yet to conclude that these choices necessarily align with a contribution to societal sustainability goals.}

This study investigates pedestrian crossing behaviour which, as an important element of urban dynamics, is expected to be affected by the presence of automated vehicles. For this purpose, an interpretable machine learning framework is proposed to explore factors affecting pedestrians’ wait time before crossing mid-block crosswalks in the presence of automated vehicles. To collect rich behavioural data, we developed a dynamic and immersive virtual reality experiment, with 180 participants from a heterogeneous population in 4 different locations in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). Pedestrian wait time behaviour is then analysed using a data-driven Cox Proportional Hazards (CPH) model, in which the linear combination of the covariates is replaced by a flexible non-linear deep neural network. The proposed model achieved a 5\% improvement in goodness of fit, but more importantly, enabled us to incorporate a richer set of covariates. A game theoretic based interpretability method is used to understand the contribution of different covariates to the time pedestrians wait before crossing. Results show that the presence of automated vehicles on roads, wider lane widths, high density on roads, limited sight distance, and lack of walking habits are the main contributing factors to longer wait times. Our study suggested that, to move towards pedestrian-friendly urban areas, educational programs for children, enhanced safety measures for seniors, promotion of active modes of transportation, and revised traffic rules and regulations should be considered.}

abstract = {Various perimeter metering control strategies have been proposed for urban traffic networks that rely on the existence of well-defined relationships between network productivity and accumulation, known more commonly as network Macroscopic Fundamental Diagrams (MFD). Most existing perimeter metering control strategies require accurate modeling of traffic dynamics with full knowledge of the network MFD and dynamic equations to describe how vehicles move across regions of the network. However, such information is generally difficult to obtain and subject to error. Some model free perimeter metering control schemes have been recently proposed in the literature. However, these existing approaches require estimates of network properties (e.g., the critical accumulation associated with maximum network productivity) in the controller designs. In this paper, a model free deep reinforcement learning perimeter control (MFDRLPC) scheme is proposed for two-region urban networks that features agents with either continuous or discrete action spaces. The proposed agents learn to select control actions through a reinforcement learning process without assuming any information about environment dynamics. Results from extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed agents: (a) can consistently learn perimeter control strategies under various environment configurations; (b) are comparable in performance to the state-of-the-art, model predictive control (MPC); and, (c) are highly transferable to a wide range of traffic conditions and dynamics in the environment.}

For situational awareness and decision-support, quickly available yet accurate big-data analytics about human mobility and social distancing is invaluable to agencies and decision-makers. This paper presents a big-data-driven analytical framework that ingests terabytes of data on a daily basis and quantitatively assesses the human mobility trend during COVID-19. Using mobile device location data of over 150 million monthly active samples in the United States (U.S.), the study successfully measures human mobility with three main metrics at the county level: daily average number of trips per person; daily average person-miles traveled; and daily percentage of residents staying home. A set of generalized additive mixed models is employed to disentangle the policy effect on human mobility from other confounding effects including virus effect, socio-demographic effect, weather effect, industry effect, and spatiotemporal autocorrelation. Results reveal the policy plays a limited, time-decreasing, and region-specific effect on human movement. The stay-at-home orders only contribute to a 3.5\%-7.9\% decrease in human mobility, while the reopening guidelines lead to a 1.6\%-5.2\% mobility increase. Results also indicate a reasonable spatial heterogeneity among the U.S. counties, wherein the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, income levels, industry structure, age and racial distribution play important roles. The data informatics generated by the framework are made available to the public for a timely understanding of mobility trends and policy effects, as well as for time-sensitive decision support to further contain the spread of the virus.}

Two types of pressure measures, including an endogenous and an exogenous pressure, are defined. The endogenous pressure is associated with the estimated exit-flow during a signal phase in the next time period, while the exogenous pressure is a virtual pressure associated with the downstream links. The properties of the proposed signal control strategy, including localized waiting time minimization and queue length stabilization at each isolated intersection were discussed. The performance of the proposed signal control strategy was evaluated with two testing networks via simulation, including a network with an isolated signalized intersection and a network with multiple signalized intersections. We compared the performance of the proposed DP control strategy with three existing strategies, including the fixed signal control, adaptive signal control and a back-pressure algorithm based control strategy proposed by previous studies. The test results show promise of the proposed DP control strategy in improving network travel time and queue stability when compared with several state-of-art decentralized control strategies, even though we acknowledge that future efforts in extending the decentralized strategy towards a better system-wide coordination are warranted.}

abstract = {In the foreseeable future, connected vehicles (CVs) will coexist with traditional vehicles (TVs) resulting in a complex mixed traffic environment and the success of CVs will depend on the characteristics of this mixed traffic. Therefore, before the large scale deployment of CVs, it is important to examine how CVs will influence the characteristics of the resultant mixed traffic. To achieve this aim, this study models the mixed traffic of TVs and CVs, and examines the traffic flow disturbance, efficiency, and safety. Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) with estimation errors is utilised to model TVs since it incorporates human factors such as estimation errors. Whereas, connected vehicle driving strategy integrated with IDM is utilised to model CVs because it incorporates driver compliance, a critical human factor for the success of CVs. Moreover, two classes of drivers based on their compliance levels are considered, namely the high-compliance drivers and the low-compliance drivers, to comprehensively investigate the impact of driver compliance on the mixed traffic of CVs and TVs. Two simulation experiments are performed in this study. The first experiment is used to measure traffic flow disturbance and safety while the second is used to measure the traffic flow efficiency. Furthermore, a total of 7 mixed traffic environments are generated in each experiment via different combinations of TVs, CVs with low compliance drivers, and CVs with high compliance drivers. Another important point considered in the simulation is the spatially distribution of CVs in the platoon. As such, three platoon policies are investigated. In the first policy i.e., the best case, the CVs are spatially arranged with a motive to maximise benefits from CVs whereas in the second policy i.e., the worst case, the CVs are spatially arranged with a motive to minimise benefits from CVs. Finally, in the third platoon policy i.e., the random case, the CVs are distributed randomly in the platoon. This study demonstrates the importance of the spatial arrangement of CVs in a platoon at a given penetration rate and its impact on traffic flow disturbance, efficiency, and safety. Moreover, findings from this study underscores that CVs can supress the traffic flow disturbance, and enhance traffic flow efficiency, and safety; however, traffic engineers and policy makers have to be cautious regarding how CVs are distributed in a traffic stream when deploying these vehicles in the real world traffic environment.}

The first model maximizes the transferability at transfer stations without the distinction of the stations. The second model, based on a refined classification of stations and lines, optimizes the transferability at transfer stations between different transport modes. The third model maximizes the multimodal coordination taking into account the space-time distribution of the arrivals and departures of the connecting modes. These models are formulated as mixed-integer linear programming by linearization techniques for finding the optimal timetable solutions. The proposed models are tested in the Beijing URT network connecting three railway stations and two airport terminals. The numerical results indicate that the proposed models can effectively improve the coordination among the last trains within the URT network and between the URT and the connecting modes.}

(2018) that leverages the structure of commuting patterns and urban communities to optimize trip sharing. It aims at quantifying the benefits of autonomous vehicles for community-based trip sharing, compared to a car-pooling platform where vehicles are driven by their owners. In the considered problem, each rider specifies a desired arrival time for her inbound trip (commuting to work) and a departure time for her outbound trip (commuting back home). In addition, her commute time cannot deviate too much from the duration of a direct trip. Prior work motivated by reducing parking pressure and congestion in the city of Ann Arbor, Michigan, showed that a car-pooling platform for community-based trip sharing could reduce the number of vehicles by close to 60\%. This paper studies the potential benefits of autonomous vehicles in further reducing the number of vehicles needed to serve all these commuting trips. It proposes a column-generation procedure that generates and assembles mini routes to serve inbound and outbound trips, using a lexicographic objective that first minimizes the required vehicle count and then the total travel distance. The optimization algorithm is evaluated on a large-scale, real-world dataset of commute trips from the city of Ann Arbor, Michigan. The results of the optimization show that it can leverage autonomous vehicles to reduce the daily vehicle usage by 92\%, improving upon the results of the original Commute Trip Sharing Problem by 34\%, while also reducing daily vehicle miles traveled by approximately 30\%. These results demonstrate the significant potential of autonomous vehicles for the shared commuting of a community to a common work destination.}

The specific problem tackled in this paper, refers to the airport capacity management under uncertainty, and the Opt–Sim framework is applied to a real case study (Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport, France). Different implementations of the Opt–Sim framework were tested based on: parameters for driving the Opt–Sim algorithmic framework and parameters for driving the optimization search algorithm. Results show that, by applying the Opt–Sim framework, potential aircraft conflicts could be reduced up to 57\% over the non-optimized scenario.

With multimodal large-scale networks, this problem becomes even more severe. This paper proposes a metamodel-based simulation optimization framework for calibrating an agent-based multimodal traffic microsimulator. The metamodel serves as a surrogate of the simulation model for faster and more tractable calibration optimization. In particular, a simplified multimodal traffic model is developed and incorporated in the metamodel. This paper also develops and compares three gradient-based metamodel schemes, taking account of the derivatives of link flows with respect to the calibration parameters in the metamodel fitting process. Numerical results on a toy network show that the proposed metamodel incorporating an analytical traffic model is more efficient and highly adaptable compared to the conventional pure polynomial metamodel schemes. Moreover, taking into account gradient information in the metamodels improves the performance of convergence and solution quality. The proposed metamodel-based method is further applied to calibrate the simulation of an actual network in Hong Kong. The results confirm the applicability of the proposed calibration method for large-scale networks. The proposed framework can be applied to other simulation-based optimization problems as well.}

The complex urban road network structure leads to irregular shapes and arrangements of regions, which poses a challenge for capturing the spatio-temporal correlation of demand generated in different regions. In this study, we propose a multi-community spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (MC\_STGCN) framework to predict passenger demand at a multi-region level by exploring spatio-temporal correlations among regions. Specifically, the gated recurrent unit (GRU) is applied to encode the temporal correlation in regions into a vector. On the other hand, the spatial correlations among regions are encoded into two graphs through the graph convolutional network (GCN): geographically adjacent graph and functional similarity graph. Then, a prediction module based on the Louvain algorithm is used to accomplish the passenger demand prediction of multi-regions. The two real-world taxi order data collected in Shenzhen City and New York City are used in model validation and comparison. The numerical results show that the MC\_STGCN model outperforms both classical time-series prediction methods and deep learning approaches. Moreover, in order to better illustrate the superiority of the proposed model, we further discuss the improvement of prediction performance though spatio-temporal correlation modeling and analyzing, the effectiveness of community detection compared with random classification of regions, and the advantages of regional level prediction compared with grid-based prediction models.}

To this end, we develop a generally applicable methodology to model and analyse shared micromobility competition and mode choice using widely accessible vehicle location data. We apply this methodology to estimate the first comprehensive mode choice models between four different micromobility modes using the largest and densest empirical shared micromobility dataset to-date. Our results suggest that mode choice is nested (dockless and docked) and dominated by distance and time of day. Docked modes are preferred for commuting. Hence, docking infrastructure for currently dockless modes could be vital for bolstering micromobility as an attractive alternative to private cars to tackle urban congestion during rush hours. Furthermore, our results reveal a fundamental relationship between fleet density and usage. A “plateau effect” is observed with decreasing marginal utility gains for increasing fleet densities. City authorities and service providers can leverage this quantitative relationship to develop evidence-based micromobility regulation and optimise their fleet deployment, respectively.}

We consider the agencies of residential parking lots as the players to make collective decisions on behalf of the property owners, and study the market design problem for this new shared parking model. Specifically, we investigate how to assign to each agency a quota of parking spaces from every other agency that its commuters can book in advance through an e-platform and how to specify transfer prices for exchanges, with the objective to maximize agencies’ welfare. Our problem is a new discrete many-to-many exchange economy with multi-unit valuation. We design a stable exchange scheme based on the trading network theory, and show that this new scheme is efficient and in the core. In the real environment with random cancelations over time, we further develop a rolling-horizon rebalance procedure that minimizes the welfare loss. Computational experiments using real-world data demonstrate that our stable exchange scheme substantially outperforms the commonly adopted solutions based on the first-come-first-serve protocol and also reveal a variety of interesting insights for practice.}

abstract = {This study examines the potential of using smart card data in public transit systems to infer attributes of travelers, thereby facilitating a more user-centered public transport service design while reducing the use of expensive and time-consuming travel surveys. This is challenging since travel behaviors vary significantly over the population, space, and time and developing meaningful links between them and traveler attributes are not trivial. To achieve this, we conduct an extensive analysis of spatio-temporal travel behavior patterns using smart card data from the Greater Sydney area (Opal card), and then develop a Hybrid Neural Network to utilize spatial and temporal dependencies in the dataset. In particular, we first empirically analyze passengers’ movements and mobility patterns from both spatial and temporal perspectives and design a set of discriminative features to characterize the patterns. We then propose a deep-learning-based framework to investigate spatial and temporal features in order to infer traveler attributes. The proposed modeling framework consists of two components, i.e., a Product-based Spatial–Temporal Module (PSTM) and an Auto-Encoder-based Compression Module (AECM). PSTM encodes the relationships across a variety of features while AECM derives useful spatial information from a transit stop matrix. The proposed model is tested and evaluated using a large-scale public transport dataset in the Greater Sydney area to infer two attributes of passengers, i.e., the age group and residential area. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method against a number of established tools in the literature. The developed techniques can be potentially adapted to other domains where spatio-temporal features are critical, such as commercial/entertainment site selection and urban service planning.}

In this paper, we develop a joint revealed preference-stated preference model for the choice between pooled versus private ride-hailing that (a) accommodates a suite of individual-level socio-demographics, individual-level psycho-social attributes, built environment variables, and trip-level variables, and (b) explicitly recognizes the importance of considering familiarity with pooled ride-hailing (RH) as an integral element of the pooled RH choice process. The primary source of data for the analysis is drawn from a 2019 survey of Austin, Texas residents. Our results underscore the value of using psycho-social latent constructs in the adoption of current and emerging mobility services, both in terms of improved prediction fit as well as in terms of designing proactive strategies to promote pooled RH service adoption. Women, older adults, and non-Hispanic/non-Latino Whites have a low propensity to choose the pooled RH mode, while employed individuals, highly educated individuals, and those living in high density urban areas have a high propensity. Overall, the average VTT estimate is \$27.80 per hour for commute travel, \$19.40 per hour for shopping travel, and \$10.70 per hour for leisure travel, while the willingness to pool (that is, the willingness to pay to not pool a ride or WTS) averages about 62 cents for commute travel, \$1.70 for shopping travel and \$1.32 for leisure travel. These estimates can be used by TNCs and cities to consider new integrated pooled RH-fixed transit service designs, position traffic congestion alleviation strategies and new mobility services, and customize information campaigns to promote pooled RH mode use.}

The FS-TSP is a variant of the TSP where routing decisions are integrated with customer-to-drone and customer-to-truck assignment decisions and truck-and-drone synchronization constraints. The objective is the minimization of the time required to serve all the customers, taking into account drone payload capacity and battery power constraints. In this work we provide a new representation of the FS-TSP based on the definition of an extended graph. This representation allows to model the problem by a new and compact integer linear programming formulation, where the synchronization issue is tackled in a column generation fashion, thus avoiding the usage of big-M constraints, representing one of the main drawbacks of the models present in literature. The proposed formulation has been solved by an exact approach which combines a Branch-and-Cut algorithm and a column generation procedure, strengthened by variable fixing strategies and new valid inequalities specifically defined for the problem. The proposed method has been experienced on a large set of benchmark instances. Computational results show that the proposed approach either is competitive or outperforms the best exact approach present in literature for the FS-TSP. Indeed, it is able to provide the optimal solution for all small size instances with 10 customers and for several medium size instances with 20 customers, some of them never solved before.}

While most approaches focus only on infrastructure resources (i.e. availability of train paths), we include both infrastructure and vehicle resources in a capacity estimation problem. We study the railway capacity estimation problem applying an associated timetable saturation method; in other words, the capacity is related to a timetable where no additional trains can be added. We use optimization methods to find such a timetable integrating explicitly variables and constraints from vehicle circulation. A hybrid time–space network describes the integrated timetabling and vehicles scheduling problem, based on which an integer programming model can be formulated, to maximize the overall transportation performance. A Lagrangian relaxation-based decomposition algorithm is proposed to solve the problem, and is shown able to scale to large instances efficiently. The integrated scheduling problem is decomposed into a timetabling sub-problem and a vehicle circulation sub-problem by dualizing the consistency constraints linking the two. A new heuristic, based on the concept of timetable intensity, is employed to improve the quality of the feasible (non-relaxed) solution found. The experimental result shows the benefit of the approach, which can evaluate transportation performance and relate it to various fleet sizes, vehicle depot locations, and minimum headways.}

CAVs not only provide a new source of data for traffic management but also can be controlled as actuators to improve traffic flow. This study proposes a hierarchical and implementation-ready cooperative driving framework with a mixed traffic composition of CAVs, connected vehicles (CVs), and regular vehicles (RVs) for urban arterials. The proposed framework combines centralized and distributed control concepts, where the infrastructure generates optimal signal timing plans and provides high-level trajectory guidance to the CAVs while detailed trajectories are generated by each vehicle. The system consists of three levels of models. At the vehicle level, a state transition diagram is designed for different modes of operations of CAVs including eco-trajectory planning, cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) and collision avoidance. At the intersection level, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem is formulated to optimize the signal timing plan and arrival time of CAVs, with consideration of CACC platooning behaviors. At the corridor level, link performance functions are applied to calculate the total delay of the coordinated phases of each intersection, and a linear programming (LP) problem is formulated to optimize the offsets for every cycle, which are then passed to the intersection level. Simulation results from a calibrated real-world arterial corridor show that both mobility and fuel economy benefits from the cooperative driving framework. The total delay is reduced by 2.2\%−33.0\% and fuel consumption by 3.9\%−7.4\%, with different mixture of vehicle compositions and CAV penetration rates (e.g., 0\%−100\%). Sensitivity analysis on volume fluctuation is performed, which confirms the benefits of the dynamic offset optimization.}

Research into pedestrian dynamics has carefully studied route planning and single instances of decisions on routes. However, little is known about the decision-making processes in sequences of consecutive pedestrian route choices. Here, we propose the first mathematical model for this situation. Its key hypothesis is that the sensitivity of pedestrians to environmental information, such as signs or the movement of others, diminishes, the more decisions they make in sequence. To validate our model, we conduct a virtual reality experiment with over 200 participants. Our findings suggest that sensitivity to information diminishes for the experimental case when only information on the movement of others is available to pedestrians. Comparison of our model to situations when signs are present and to data from previously published work suggests that this effect cannot be detected in short sequences of route decisions that contain three or fewer decision points. We demonstrate the implications of this diminishing sensitivity to environmental information at the example of egress from a metro-station. While the proportion of pedestrians using a signposted shortest route may decrease, following behaviour is also suppressed which may result in more predictable route choice dynamics across pedestrian crowds. We advocate further study on this topic in real-world settings, to investigate the need for appropriate pedestrian route choice management strategies. Our experiment also provides preliminary insights into how different personality traits affect following behaviour and we suggest this opens another avenue for future investigation.}

To manage chassis dislocation, two strategies are presented in this paper. In the first strategy, a model is presented to support the chassis repositioning decision faced by chassis pool operators. We consider the case that an (accurate) probability distribution of chassis demand is unknown. For such a case, it is generally not possible to determine the exact optimal number of chassis to reposition. Lower and upper bounds on the optimal cost are derived that are explicitly shown to converge to the minimum cost. The second strategy is chassis yard consolidation, which has the potential to reduce the variance in chassis demand and, therefore, lead to more accurate demand forecasts. An effective algorithm to iteratively reduce the variance in chassis demand is provided. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the strategies.}

This paper proposes an adaptive traffic signal control system in a CV environment. At the intersection level, an adaptive control model is developed to assign optimal green times by minimizing the total vehicle delay. When the CV penetration rate is low, a method depending on limited CV data is presented to estimate the vehicle arrival information. At the corridor level, a real-time optimization model is formulated to design the dynamic progression plan for critical paths (i.e. paths with high flows). These two optimization models are solved by the dynamic programming technique. A real-world arterial is modeled in VISSIM to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed traffic signal control system. Simulations with various CV penetration rates and demand levels are conducted to compare the proposed system with fixed coordination and adaptive signal control systems. Results indicate that the proposed system outperforms both base systems by reducing 15.67\% and 13.81\% of the average delay, respectively, when the CV penetration rate is relatively high. Moreover, the proposed system can improve the arterial performance under all tested scenarios with various CV penetration rates and demand levels. Since the tested demand scenarios can reflect the real traffic fluctuations, it can be proved that the proposed control system could be applied in the field to boost the overall traffic efficiency along the arterial.}

Many features impact on taxi time, including the route taken, aircraft category, operational mode of the airport, traffic congestion information, and local weather conditions. Working with real-world data for several international airports, we compare multiple prediction models and investigate the impact of these features, drawing conclusions on the most important features for accurately modelling taxi times. We show that high accuracy can be achieved with a small subset of the features consisting of those generally important across all airports (departure/arrival, distance, total turns, average speed and numbers of recent aircraft), and a small number of features specific to particular target airports. Moving from all features to this small subset results in less than a 1 percentage-point drop in movements correctly predicted within 1, 3 and 5 min.}

Leveraging spatial–temporal data from multiple sources for (citywide) traffic forecasting is a key to strengthen the smart city management in areas such as urban traffic control, abnormal event detection, etc. Existing approaches of traffic flow prediction mainly rely on the development of various deep neural networks –e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks such as ResNet are used for modeling spatial dependencies among different regions, whereas recurrent neural networks are increasingly implemented for temporal dynamics modeling. Despite their advantages, the existing approaches suffer from limitations of intensive computations, lack of capabilities to properly deal with missing values, and simplistic integration of heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose a novel urban flow prediction framework by generalizing the hidden states of the model with continuous-time dynamics of the latent states using neural ordinary differential equations (ODE). Specifically, we introduce a discretize-then-optimize approach to improve and balance the prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. It not only guarantees the prediction error but also provides high flexibility for decision-makers. Furthermore, we investigate the factors, both intrinsic and extrinsic, that affect the city traffic volume and use separate neural networks to extract and disentangle the influencing factors, which avoids the brute-force data fusion in previous works. Extensive experiments conducted on the real-world large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines, while requiring significantly less memory cost and fewer model parameters.}

Nonetheless, the key components of traffic dynamics, vehicle modeling, and traffic environment are oversimplified in existing simulators. Current traffic simulators normally simplify the function of connected and autonomous vehicles by proposing incremental improvements to the conventional traffic flow modeling methods, which cannot reflect the characteristics of the realistic connected and autonomous vehicles. On the other hand, typical autonomous vehicle simulators only focus on individual function verification in some specific traffic scenarios, omitting the network-level evaluation by integrating both large-scale traffic networks and vehicle-to-anything (V2X) communication. This paper designs a comprehensive simulation platform for conventional, connected and automated driving from a transportation cyber–physical system perspective, which tightly combines the core components of V2X communication, traffic networks, and autonomous/conventional vehicle model. Specifically, three popular open-source simulators SUMO, Omnet++, and Webots are integrated and connected via the traffic control interface, and the whole simulation platform will be deployed in a Client/Server model. As the demonstration, two typical applications, traffic flow optimization and vehicle eco-driving, are implemented in the simulation platform.

Inspired by the well-known Lotka-Volterra equations, a mathematical model is developed to explicitly incorporate the interactions among those parking garages under consideration. Time-dependent parking space availability is considered as the system state, while the dynamic price of parking is naturally used as the control input which can be properly chosen by the parking garage operators from the admissible set. By regulating parking rates, the total demand for parking can be distributed among the set of parking lots under question. Further, we formulate an optimal control problem (called Bolza problem) with the objective of maintaining the availability (managing the demand) of each parking garage at a desired level, which could potentially reduce traffic congestion as well as fuel consumption of CAVs. Based on the necessary conditions of optimality given by Pontryagin’s minimum principle (PMP), we develop a computational algorithm to address the nonlinear optimization problem and formally prove its convergence. A series of Monte Carlo simulations is conducted under various scenarios and the corresponding optimization problems are solved determining the optimal pricing policy for each parking lot. Since the stochastic dynamic model is general and the control inputs, i.e., parking rates, are easy to implement, it is believed that the procedures presented here will shed light on the parking management of CAVs in the near future.}

This paper proposes a hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) based Eco-Driving algorithm considering both the longitudinal acceleration/deceleration and the lateral lane-changing operations. A deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is designed to learn the continuous longitudinal acceleration/deceleration to reduce the fuel consumption as well as to maintain acceptable travel time. Collecting the critic’s value of each single lane from DDPG and integrating the information of adjacent lanes, a deep Q-learning algorithm is developed to make the discrete lane-changing decision. Together, a hybrid deep Q-learning and policy gradient (HDQPG) method is developed for vehicles driving along multi-lane urban signalized corridors. The method can enable the controlled vehicle to learn well-established longitudinal fuel-saving strategies, and to perform appropriate lane-changing operations at proper times to avoid congested lanes. Numerical experiments show that HDQPG can reduce fuel consumption by up to 46\% with marginal or no increase of travel times.}

The model has two submodels: transit timetabling and passenger-equilibrium assignment. The transit timetabling submodel generates timetables to improve passengers’ journey experience based on the results of passenger-equilibrium assignment, whereas the passenger-equilibrium assignment loads passengers on transit vehicles based on a fixed vehicle capacity and timetable output from the transit timetabling. An iterative method is developed to connect these two submodels and efficiently determine an optimal solution. The iterative method includes an equilibrium assignment method to simulate passenger loading and suggests a decomposition approach for transit timetabling. The decomposition approach has a significant computational advantage when handling transit systems that involve hundreds of transit vehicles because the algorithm generates a timetable for one transit line in each step rather than for all transit lines. The decomposition approach can therefore handle relatively large problems with more transit lines. The suggested algorithms are analyzed with a hypothetical example and with the practically sized example of South China’s high-speed railway in terms of efficiency, optimality, and applicability.}

abstract = {In order to ensure the safe operation of parallel routes in the ocean area, it is necessary to assess the risk of lateral collision of routes. The data used in the assessment often come from the real flights, while the traditional land-based ADS-B equipment has limited coverage and cannot be used for research. The space-based ADS-B system can receive and send the flight position of the aircraft over the ocean area. In this paper, the ocean tracks in space-based ADS-B data are first extracted. According to the different route structures, the data of fixed route and flexible route are preprocessed by segmented Kalman filter and cubic polynomial fitting method respectively. Then the processed track position error is calculated, and Q-Q (Quantile-Quantile) median method is used to test the normal distribution of the error, and k-means clustering is used to obtain the clustering center and occurrence frequency of positioning error and flight error. Finally, a collision risk model based on Bayesian network is established, and the error distribution parameters and occurrence frequency are brought into the model to evaluate the collision risk of parallel routes in the ocean area. The results show that the lateral collision risk based on space-based ADS-B ocean flight data is lower than 0.5 × 10−8 times/hour specified by ICAO when the fixed route separation is 14n miles and the flexible route separation is 49n miles. And the actual lateral interval of the Pacific flexible route is 50n miles (Jiang, 2010), which meets the safety target level.}

abstract = {Short-term traffic flow forecasting is a key element in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) to provide proactive traffic state information to road network operators. A variety of methods to predict traffic variables in the short-term can be found in the literature, ranging from time-series algorithms, machine learning tools and deep learning methods to a selective hybrid of these approaches. Despite the advances in prediction techniques, a challenging problem that affects the application of such methods in the real world is the prevalence of insufficient data across an entire network. It is rare that extensive historical training data required for model training are available for all the links in a city. In order to address this data insufficiency problem, this paper applies transfer learning techniques to machine learning methods in short-term traffic prediction. All the traffic data used in this paper were collected from Highways England road networks in the UK. The results show that through improving the transferability of machine learning-based models, the computational burden due to the model training process can be significantly reduced and the prediction accuracy under data deficient scenarios can be improved for one-step ahead prediction. However, the prediction accuracy gradually decreases in multi-step ahead prediction. It is also found that the accuracy of the proposed hybrid method is highly dependent upon consistency between datasets but less dependent on geographical attributes of links.}

abstract = {Vehicle platooning has gained attention for its potential to increase road capacity and safety, and higher fuel efficiency. Platoon controls are implemented over Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) wireless communication, in-vehicle networks and Electronic Control Units (ECUs). V2V communication has a low message rate imposed by the V2V standard compared to the rate of modern in-vehicle networks and ECUs. The platoon control strategy should take into account such multi-rate nature of the implementation architecture for higher performance. Current literature does not explicitly consider such real-life constraints. We propose a two-layered control framework for vehicle platoons wirelessly communicating complying with the industrial standard IEEE 802.11p. In the upper-layer, vehicles receive state information from the immediate preceding vehicle over a control channel at 10 Hz under the IEEE 802.11p standard with occasional packet drops. Using such information and the vehicle state information, the engine control system, i.e.the lower-layer, realizes the desired vehicle state (e.g., acceleration) over the fast and reliable in-vehicle networks (e.g., FlexRay, Ethernet). In this work, a distributed model predictive control framework is proposed for the upper-layer targeting a Predecessor-Follower (PF) topology. A state-feedback control scheme is proposed for realizing the desired vehicle states for the lower-layer. Our framework minimizes the inter-vehicle distance and the tracking error enforcing collision avoidance and robustness against packet drops at the upper-layer. We validate our algorithm in simulation using our co-simulation framework CReTS and on an embedded platform, developed by Cohda Wireless and NXP, running in real time and communicating through the IEEE 802.11p standard. With extensive simulations and experiments, we evaluate the performance and feasibility of the proposed framework under a number of practical constraints. Our approach is a step towards the implementation of platoon control in reality.}

We propose a novel model describing the dynamic behaviors of such a system and the proposed model is validated via road tests in Singapore traffic network and simulations in VISSIM. A piecewise linear model is adopted to describe the traffic flow dynamics at each signalized intersection, while a platooning-like first-in-first-out (FIFO) model is proposed to depict the dynamics at each non-signalized intersection. A traffic light control problem for a heterogeneous traffic network is formulated based on the proposed macroscopic model as a mixed integer programming problem. Simulations indicate that the proposed optimal traffic control scheme could outperform the fixed-time traffic light control strategy and conventional actuated traffic light control scheme. Besides, we demonstrate potentials in developing a systematic planning approach on deciding which traffic intersections require signal control to ensure good traffic control performance.}

Different from other short-term traffic forecasting methods, the short-term OD flow prediction possesses three unique characteristics: (1) data availability: real-time OD flow is not available during the prediction; (2) data dimensionality: the dimension of the OD flow is much higher than the cardinality of transportation networks; (3) data sparsity: URT OD flow is spatiotemporally sparse. There is a great need to develop novel OD flow forecasting method that explicitly considers the unique characteristics of the URT system. To this end, a channel-wise attentive split–convolutional neural network (CAS-CNN) is proposed. The proposed model consists of many novel components such as the channel-wise attention mechanism and split CNN. In particular, an inflow/outflow-gated mechanism is innovatively introduced to address the data availability issue. We further originally propose a masked loss function to solve the data dimensionality and data sparsity issues. The model interpretability is also discussed in detail. The CAS–CNN model is tested on two large-scale real-world datasets from Beijing Subway, and it outperforms the rest of benchmarking methods. The proposed model contributes to the development of short-term OD flow prediction, and it also lays the foundations of real-time URT operation and management.}

First, after a principal component analysis, observation days of a historical dataset are clustered. Two different methods are compared: a Gaussian Mixture Model and a k-means algorithm. The clustering results reveal that congestion maps of days of the same group have substantial similarity in their traffic conditions and dynamic. Such a map is a binary visualization of the congestion propagation on the freeway, giving more importance to the traffic dynamics. Second, a consensus day is identified in each cluster as the most representative day of the community according to the congestion maps. Third, this information obtained from the historical data is used to predict traffic congestion propagation and travel times. Thus, the first measurements of a new day are used to determine which consensual day is the closest to this new day. The past observations recorded for that consensual day are then used to predict future traffic conditions and travel times. This method is tested using ten months of data collected on a French freeway and shows very encouraging results.}

In our contribution, we focus on the time-critical process of aircraft boarding, where regulations regarding physical distances between passengers will significantly increase boarding time. The passenger behavior is implemented in a field-validated stochastic cellular automata model, which is extended by a module to evaluate the transmission risk. We propose an improved boarding process by considering that most of the passengers are travel together and should be boarded and seated as a group. The NP-hard seat allocation of groups with minimized individual interactions between groups is solved with a genetic algorithm. Then, the improved seat allocation is used to derive an associated boarding sequence aiming at both short boarding times and low risk of virus transmission. Our results show that the consideration of groups will significantly contribute to a faster boarding (reduction of time by about 60\%) and less transmission risk (reduced by 85\%) compared to the standard random boarding procedures applied in the pandemic scenario.}

abstract = {In the era of transportation big data, the analysis of mobility patterns generally involves large quantities of datasets with high-dimensional variables recording individual travelers’ activities and socio-economic attributes, bringing new challenges to researchers. Conventional regression-based models commonly require complex structures in depicting random or fixed effects with a considerable number of parameters to estimate, and state-of-the-art machine learning models are regarded as black-boxes that are not clear in interpreting the mechanism in human mobility. To overcome the challenges of capturing complex high-order relationships among variables of interest, this paper proposes a Bayesian supervised learning tensor factorization (BSTF) model for the classification of travel choices in the mobility pattern analysis. The BSTF model induces a hierarchical probabilistic structure between predictor variables and the dependent variable, which offers a nature supervised learning foundation via Bayesian inference. Latent class (LC) variables are considered in the BSTF model to discover hidden preferences/states among travelers associated with their mobility patterns. We apply the BSTF model to analyze passenger-side choice patterns between diverse service options on a ride-sourcing platform, drawing increasing attention during recent years. A case study with a real-world dynamic ridesharing dataset in Hangzhou, China, is conducted. Different cases of training sizes are utilized to fit the proposed BSTF model as well as some other state-of-the-art machine learning models. By identifying significant variables and derive their probabilistic relationship between service types (i.e., ridesharing, non-sharing, and taxi), the proposed BSTF model offers good performance in both classification accuracy and the interpretability of shared mobility.}

abstract = {By serving two or more passenger requests in each ride in ride-sourcing markets, ride-pooling service is now becoming an important component of shared smart mobility. It is generally expected to improve vehicle utilization rate, and therefore alleviate traffic congestion and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. A few recent theoretical studies are conducted, mainly focusing on the equilibrium analysis of the ride-sourcing markets with ride-pooling services and the impacts of ride-pooling services on transit ridership and traffic congestion. In these studies, there are three key measures that distinguish ride-pooling service analysis from the non-pooling ride-sourcing market analysis. The first is the proportion of passengers who are pool-matched(referred to as pool-matching probability), the second is passengers’ average detour distance, and the third is average vehicle routing distance to pick up and drop off all passengers with different origins and destinations in one specific ride. These three measures are determined by passenger demand for ride-pooling and matching strategies. However, due to the complex nature of ride-resourcing market, it is difficult to analytically determine the relationships between these measures and passenger demand. To fill this research gap, this paper attempts to empirically ascertain these relationships through extensive experiments based on the actual on-demand mobility data obtained from Chengdu, Haikou, and Manhattan. We are surprised to find that the relationships between the three measures (pool-matching probability, passengers’ average detour distance, average vehicle routing distance) and number of passengers in the matching pool (which reflects passenger demand) can be fitted by some simple curves (with fairly high goodness-of-fit) or there exist elegant empirical laws on these relationships. Our findings are insightful and useful to theoretical modeling and applications in ride-resourcing markets, such as evaluation of the impacts of ride-pooling on transit usage and traffic congestion.}

Recently, deep learning based methods have been widely used in vehicle detection with high accuracy and efficiency. However, deep learning based methods require a large number of manually labeled ground truths (bounding box of each vehicle in each image) to train the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In the modern urban surveillance cameras, there are already many manually labeled ground truths in daytime images for training CNN, while there are little or much less manually labeled ground truths in nighttime images. In this paper, we focus on the research to make maximum usage of labeled daytime images (Source Domain) to help the vehicle detection in unlabeled nighttime images (Target Domain). For this purpose, we propose a new situation-sensitive method based on Faster R-CNN with Domain Adaptation (DA) to improve the vehicle detection at nighttime. Furthermore, a situation-sensitive traffic flow parameter estimation method is developed based on the traffic flow theory. We collected a new dataset of 2,200 traffic images (1,200 for daytime and 1,000 for nighttime) of 57,059 vehicles to evaluate the proposed method for the vehicle detection. Another new dataset with three 1,800-frame daytime videos and one 1,800-frame nighttime video of about 260 K vehicles was collected to evaluate and show the estimated traffic flow parameters in different situations. The experimental results show the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method.}

A central concept of these guidelines is the prioritization of the satisfaction of the requested slots according to a hierarchy that recognizes historic usage rights of slots. A number of criteria have been proposed in the literature to optimize airport slot allocation decisions. Multi-objective programming models have been proposed to investigate the trade-offs of the slot allocation objectives for the same level of the slot hierarchy. However, the literature currently lacks models that can study in a systematic way the trade-offs among the scheduling objectives across all levels of the hierarchy and the airport schedule as a whole. To close the existing literature gap, we are proposing a new tri-objective slot allocation model (TOSAM) that considers total schedule displacement, maximum schedule displacement and demand-based fairness, and we introduce a multi-level, multi-objective algorithm to solve it. We are using real world slot request and airport capacity data to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. Our computational results suggest that the systematic consideration of the interactions among the objectives of the different levels of the slot hierarchy, results to improved schedule-wide slot scheduling performance. In particular, we found that small sacrifices made for the attainment of the scheduling objectives of the upper echelons of the slot hierarchy, result in significant improvements of the schedule-wide objectives.}

This study attempts to bridge the research gap by predicting signal cycle-level through and left-turn movements in real-time at signalized intersections. The utilized data were limited to the upstream and downstream intersections at the corridor level. Aiming to achieve this objective, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models were developed using datsets that contain variables from different number of utilized cycles (4, 6, and 8 cycles). The three models were evaluated by calculating Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The results showed that the performance measures for the three models were close. Meanwhile. the GRU model using variables from six previous cycles outperformed the others. This modelling approach was followed to predict traffic movements for different time horizons (five cycles ahead). The performance measures values were close for the five predicted cycles. It is expected that the model could help in obtaining accurate traffic movement at intersections, which could be used for adjusting adaptive signal timing and improve signal and intersections’ efficiency.}

abstract = {The effectiveness of traditional traffic prediction methods, such as autoregressive or spatio-temporal models, is often extremely limited when forecasting traffic dynamics in early morning. The reason is that traffic can break down drastically during the early morning commute, and the time and duration of this break-down vary substantially from day to day. Early morning traffic forecast is crucial to inform morning-commute traffic management, but they are generally challenging to predict in advance, particularly by midnight (called ‘next-day morning traffic prediction’ thereafter). In this paper, we propose to mine Twitter messages as a probing method to understand the impacts of people’s work and rest patterns in the evening/midnight of the previous day to the next-day morning traffic. The model is tested on freeway networks in Pittsburgh as experiments. The resulting relationship is surprisingly simple and powerful. We find that, in general, the earlier people rest as indicated from Tweets, the more congested roads will be in the next morning. The occurrence of big events in the evening before, represented by higher or lower tweet sentiment than normal, often implies lower travel demand in the next morning than normal days. Besides, people’s tweeting activities in the night before and early morning (by 5am) are statistically associated with congestion in morning peak hours. We make use of such relationships to build a predictive framework which forecasts morning commute congestion using people’s tweeting profiles extracted by 5am. In most cases, the tweet information collected by the midnight before is sufficient to make good prediction for next-day morning traffic. The Pittsburgh study supports that this framework can precisely predict morning congestion, particularly for some road segments upstream of roadway bottlenecks with large day-to-day congestion variation, while its prediction performance being no worse than baseline methods on other roads. Through experiments, we demonstrate our approach considerably outperforms those existing methods without Twitter message features, and it can learn meaningful representation of demand from tweeting profiles that offer managerial insights. The proposed social media empowered framework can be a promising tool for real-time traffic management and potentially extended for traffic prediction at other times of day.}

abstract = {The advent of shared-economy and smartphones made on-demand transportation services possible, which created additional opportunities, but also more complexity to urban mobility. Companies that offer these services are called Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) due to their internet-based nature. Although ride-sourcing is the most notorious service TNCs provide, little is known about to what degree its operations can interfere in traffic conditions, while replacing other transportation modes, or when a large number of idle vehicles is cruising for passengers. We experimentally analyze the efficiency of TNCs using taxi trip data from a Chinese megacity and an agent-based simulation with a trip-based MFD model for determining the speed. We investigate the effect of expanding fleet sizes for TNCs, passengers’ inclination towards sharing rides, and strategies to alleviate urban congestion. We observe that, although a larger fleet size reduces waiting time, it also intensifies congestion, which, in turn, prolongs the total travel time. Such congestion effect is so significant that it is nearly insensitive to passengers’ willingness to share and flexible supply. Finally, parking management strategies can prevent idle vehicles from cruising without assigned passengers, mitigating the negative impacts of ride-sourcing over congestion, and improving the service quality.}

abstract = {Safety guarantees are vital to the dependability of the automated vehicle (AV), so are of primary concern to the AV industry and regulatory bodies. Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS), proposed by Mobileye, is a rigorous mathematical model that defines the real-time safety distance that the AV needs to maintain in relation to surrounding vehicles, and helps the AV respond to dangerous situations. However, RSS’s performance has not yet been tested with real driving data. This study thus calibrates and evaluates the RSS model based on car-following scenarios created from safety-critical events (SCEs) detected in the Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study. SCEs were identified from the raw data with a trigger method; they were manually validated and then converted into virtual scenarios in which the human-driven subject vehicle was replaced with an AV controlled by a model predictive control based adaptive cruise control (ACC) system embedded with RSS. The RSS model was calibrated with the goal of achieving optimal safety performance, that is, of generating the lowest time-integrated time-to-collision (TIT) after the AV algorithms were implemented in the safety-critical scenarios. By comparing the performance of RSS-embedded ACC, ACC-only, and the unassisted human driver, this study found that: 1) RSS-embedded ACC performed best in eliminating underlying safety-critical situations by controlling the average TIT for each 15-second event at 2.65 s2; 2) RSS-embedded ACC generated the highest average relative speed and relative distance, and the lowest standard deviation of speed; and 3) on average, RSS-embedded ACC was able to perceive the SCEs 2.31 s ahead of the human driver.}

The paper presents a new modeling framework that is able to simulate temporal information associated with the traveler’s daily activity schedule, for use in activity-based travel demand modeling. We employed a precise and efficient machine learning technique known as Random-Forest for temporal attribute recognition. In order to capture the uncertainty of start time and activity duration, initially we derived unique clusters of homogeneous daily activity patterns from the activity data. The Random-Forest model is formulated based on the socio-demographic characteristics of travelers and temporal features of their activities. Start time and activity duration for every activity type were allocated to a set of bins. In this study, eight different bin structures, varying in the time interval, are designed as response variables. Using a heuristic decision rule-based algorithm, the predicted activities were inserted into the traveler’s skeleton schedule. An algorithm was then applied to schedule travelers’ activities based on activity importance level and guide information gained from representative patterns for homogeneous population cohorts. The model was tested using time-diary data drawn from the Space-Time Activity Research (STAR) survey for Halifax, Nova Scotia. Results show that the proposed model is able to assemble the traveler’s schedule with an average 81.62\% accuracy in the 24-hour period. The insights gained from this study include important temporal information on activities crucial for the scheduling stage of an activity-based model. Finally, the results of this paper are expected to be implemented within the activity-based travel demand model, Scheduler for Activities, Locations, and Travel (SALT).}

This paper addresses this issue by modelling the inherent attractiveness or convenience value of ownership of an automated vehicle, beyond the regular convenience parameters such as journey time, waiting or access time and reliability. Using mixed logit model on a choice experimentation data, we find that ownership is inherently valued more compared to the ride services by women. However, we also report significant heterogeneity in this valuation depending on gender and other car-ownership related characteristics, which can diminish this inherent attractiveness to the point that a majority of men may find ownership no more attractive than exclusive use ride services. We also find substantial inconvenience value associated with shared/pooled automated ride services compared to exclusive-use ride services. Implications of the results are illustrated using an example of the share of automated vehicle ownership, and exclusive-use and pooled use ride services.}

The problem lies on determining the turn-back stations, train composition and frequency of each service route operated on the line. Considering the interests of operators and passengers, we decompose the problem as two subproblems namely train service configuration and passenger assignment. The first subproblem is formulated as an integer linear programming model with the objective of minimizing operators’ cost. Given a train service scheme, the second subproblem is modelled as a capacitated continuous multi-commodity flow model to minimize passengers’ waiting time cost and transfer cost. The optimal strategy is extended to determine the behaviour of passengers and capture the extra waiting time of passengers under capacity constraint. The two sub-models are weighted and integrated into a mixed integer nonlinear programming model, which is further transformed into a mixed integer linear programming model using a novel linearization method. By exploiting the special characteristics of the model, a tailored and easy to implement local search algorithm is developed to solve large-scale instances. Starting from the operator-optimum solution which can be easily obtained, the algorithm solves the two sub-models iteratively to search better solutions within a precalculated search range which is smaller than the complete feasible domain. Finally, different sizes of instances constructed from two urban rail transit lines are utilized to demonstrate the performance and practicability of the proposed approaches.}

The proposed controller overcomes the shortcomings of the conventional eco approach and is able to: i) overtake slowly-moving vehicles for the ecological purpose; ii) optimize the travel duration approaching an intersection; iii) guarantee both fuel saving and vehicle’s mobility; iv) consider stochasticity of surrounding traffic; v) functional under partially connected and automated environment. It takes full advantage of connected vehicle technology by taking in real-time vehicle and infrastructure information as optimization input. The problem is formulated as an optimal control problem and is solved by GPOPS. The nonlinear bicycle model is adopted as the system dynamics to realize CAV’s longitudinal and lateral coupling control, and linearized to reduce the computational burden. The stochasticity of surrounding traffic is considered as a probability distribution that is transformed into a linear chance constraint. Quantitative evaluation is conducted to compare the proposed controller against human drivers and the conventional eco approach which only has longitudinal automation. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed controller improves the fuel efficiency by 4.13–70.12\%, and outperforms two baseline controllers by 6.06–36.73\% in terms of fuel saving. The range is caused by the different arrival time of the ego CAV. In addition, the simulation experiment in VISSIM is conducted to analyze how background traffic flow influences the performance of the proposed controller.}

abstract = {This paper proposes three control strategies for lane-changing (LC) at a merge bottleneck to improve bottleneck throughput by mitigating voids and speed disturbances in mixed traffic using connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technologies. Strategy 1 is ‘gap closure’ control, where an LC vehicle and its follower are controlled to close the void (extra time gap ahead) induced by the LC and prevent a backward-propagating speed disturbance. Strategy 2 is ‘batch LC’, where a group of LC vehicles are controlled to line up along a kinematic wave to minimize the total voids. Strategy 3 is ‘gap redistribution’ control, where extra gaps of vehicles are redistributed to periodically create large enough gaps for disturbance-free insertions. In a general control framework, the three strategies are integrated in different combinations exploiting their complementary nature. A numerical analysis shows that certain combinations, such as Strategy 2 and 3, can be very effective for improving bottleneck throughput. The analysis reveals insights on leveraging CAVs to develop traffic management strategies and/or policies and therefore improve system performance.}

In the proposed method, a CAV platoon is firstly discretized into a grid system, where a CAV moves from one cell to another in discrete time-space domain. Then, the cooperative sorting problem is modeled as a path-finding problem in the graphic domain. The problem is solved by the deterministic A* algorithm with a stepwise strategy, where only one vehicle can move within a movement step. The resultant shortest path is further optimized with an integer linear programming algorithm to minimize the sorting time by allowing multiple movements within a step. To improve the algorithm running time and address multiple shortest paths, a distributed stochastic A* algorithm (DSA*) is developed by introducing random disturbances to the edge costs to break uniform paths (with equal path cost). Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DSA* method. The results report shorter sorting time and significantly improved algorithm running time due to the use of DSA*. In addition, we find that the optimization performance can be further improved by increasing the number of processes in the distributed computing system.}

abstract = {This paper proposes an integrated freeway traffic flow control framework that aims to minimize the total travel cost, improve greenness and safety for freeway traffic mixed with connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and regular human-piloted vehicles (RHVs). The proposed framework devises an integrated action of several control strategies such as ramp metering, lane changing control (LCC) for CAVs and lane changing recommendation (LCR) for RHVs, variable speed limit control (VSLC) for CAVs and variable speed limit recommendation (VSLR) for RHVs with minimum safety gap control measures for lane changing and merging maneuvers. The CAVs are assumed to follow the system control instructions fully and immediately. In contrast, the RHVs would make decisions in response to the recommendations disseminated and also the behaviors of CAVs. The compliance rate of drivers to the LCR is captured by the underlying traffic flow model. A set of constraints is imposed to restrict VSLC/VSLR and LCC/LCR measures from changing too frequently or too sharply on both temporal and spatial dimensions to avoid excessive nuisance to passengers and traffic flow instability. A reinforcement learning based solution algorithm is proposed. First, a control parameterization technique is adopted to reduce the dimension of the original optimal control problem to increase computational efficiency. Then, a gradient-free Cross-Entropy-Method based algorithm is used to search the optimal parameters to circumvent the non-differentiability of the traffic flow model. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework are illustrated via numerical examples for a variety of penetration rates of CAVs under various traffic conditions. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to demonstrate the impacts of several important parameters such as the reaction time of the CAVs. It is found that the integrated control strategy can reduce the total travel cost by reducing the lane changing maneuvers and vehicles queuing at the bottleneck meanwhile smooth the traffic flow and suppress the adverse impact of shockwaves. The effect of ramp metering is not significant when the penetration rate of CAVs is high enough. Speed harmonization (with minimum gap control) in conjunction with LCC/LCR would be a better integrated control strategy under high penetration rate of CAVs.}

abstract = {Evacuations play a critical role in saving human lives during hurricanes. But individual evacuation decision-making is a complex dynamic process, often studied using post-hurricane survey data. Alternatively, ubiquitous use of social media generates a massive amount of data that can be used to predict evacuation behavior in real time. In this paper, we present a method to infer individual evacuation behaviors (e.g., evacuation decision, timing, destination) from social media data. We develop an input output hidden Markov model (IO-HMM) to infer evacuation decisions from user tweets. To extract the underlying evacuation context from tweets, we first estimate a word2vec model from a corpus of more than 100 million tweets collected over four major hurricanes. Using input variables such as evacuation context, time to landfall, type of evacuation order, and the distance from home, the proposed model infers what activities are made by individuals, when they decide to evacuate, and where they evacuate to. To validate our results, we have created a labeled dataset from 38,256 tweets posted between September 2, 2017 and September 19, 2017 by 2,571 users from Florida during hurricane Irma. Our findings show that the proposed IO-HMM method can be useful for inferring evacuation behavior in real time from social media data. Since traditional surveys are infrequent, costly, and often performed at a post-hurricane period, the proposed approach can be very useful for predicting evacuation demand as a hurricane unfolds in real time.}

In cases where large-scale adoption of an automated taxi service is anticipated, the service’s impacts may become relevant to key transport system metrics, and thus to transport planners and policy-makers as well. In light of this increasingly important question, this paper presents an agent-based transport simulation with (single passenger) AMoD. In contrast to earlier studies, all scenario data (including demand patterns, cost assumptions and customer behaviour) is obtained for one specific area, the city of Zurich, Switzerland. The simulation study fuses information from a detailed bottom-up cost analysis of mobility services in Switzerland, a specifically tailored Stated-Preferences survey about automated mobility services conducted in the canton of Zurich, and a detailed agent-based transport simulation for the city, based on MATSim. Methodologically, a comprehensive approach is presented that iteratively runs these components to derive states in which service cost, waiting times and demand are in equilibrium for a cost-covering AMoD operator with predefined fleet size. For Zurich, several cases are examined, with 4,000 AMoD vehicles leading to the maximum demand of around 150,000 requests per day that can be attracted by the system. Within these parameters, the simulation results show that customers are willing to accept average waiting times of around 4 min at a price of 0.75 CHF/km. Further cost-covering cases with lower demand are presented, where either smaller fleet sizes lead to higher waiting times, or larger fleet sizes lead to higher costs. While our simulations indicate that an AMoD system in Zurich can bring benefits to the users, they show that the system impact is largely negative. Caused by modal shifts, our simulations show an increase of driven distance of up to 100\%. All examined fleet configurations of the unregulated, cost-covering, single-passenger, door-to-door AMoD service are found to be highly counter-productive on a path towards a more shared and active transport system. Accordingly, policy recommendations for regulation are discussed.}

Imposing almost no managerial control over the occasional couriers (OC) to maximize their willingness to participate, the envisioned model suggests using transshipment points to enhance operational efficiency and a company-controlled backup delivery capacity to account for the uncertainty in the crowd-provided delivery capacity. A dynamic programming (DP) approach is developed to address the package routing problem that needs to be solved for the real-time management of the CS network. The suggested methodology does not assume any specific distributions for the courier and demand arrivals and provides the optimal package routing policy when the courier and service point capacities are not binding. Several extensions of the basic DP approach are studied to consider limited courier and service point capacities and take advantage of the extra information provided by those couriers that declare their arrivals in advance. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this study presents the first example of using Monte-Carlo simulations to determine “shadow costs” of capacity utilizations and use them in making the assignment (matching) decisions. An extensive computational study demonstrates the efficacy of the solution approach. It provides valuable insights into, among others, the potential benefits of delivering packages with a coordinated effort of OCs (with transshipments) under short delivery lead time restrictions, the impact of the spatial and temporal distribution of the demand and courier arrivals on the system performance, and the importance of the notice times for OC arrivals.}

This research develops a simple, flexible analytical framework consisting of rail fundamental diagrams describing density-flow relationships for rail traffic in specific situations such as closely following trains operating in platoons, or fleets, or double-track with directional running. It is shown that rail fundamental diagram curves depicting rail traffic flow under fixed blocks exhibit a sawtooth pattern due to the discrete nature of the control blocks. Equivalent curves describing rail traffic flow under moving blocks resemble continuous flow relationships from the highway domain. The proposed methodology can be used for a number of practical purposes including calculating shockwave effects from bottlenecks such as vertical grades, showing the dampening effect of fixed block control systems on rail traffic flow perturbations, and illustrating interactions between trains operating in a fleet, or platoon. As a complement to more detailed but time-intensive methods such as simulation, railway planners and researchers can use the rail fundamental diagram framework to quickly analyze rail traffic flow behavior under different train control systems and operating conditions.}

These models capture three important features of traffic flow: (i) the propagation of congestions in time, (ii) the propagation of congestions in space, (iii) the string instability (or stability) of traffic that is related to the amplification (or decay) of traffic waves. The proposed models have only three tunable parameters to capture these three features. One of these parameters is the time delay that models the actuator lag in vehicle dynamics, the reaction time of human drivers, and the communication and feedback delays of connected and automated vehicles. The proposed Lagrangian continuum traffic models with delays establish a framework for traffic prediction and control. On one hand, connected vehicles may use predictions about the future motion of neighboring vehicles or their own. On the other hand, the continuum nature of these models allows one to study the large-scale impact of connected vehicles on the traffic flow. This opens the path for Lagrangian (vehicle-based) traffic control that supplements existing Eulerian (location-based) traffic control techniques.}

abstract = {While research on developing and testing automated vehicle (AVs) technologies is well underway, research on their implications on travel-related behavior is in its infancy. The aim of this paper is to summarize and analyze literature that focuses on travel-related behavior impacts of AVs, namely levels 4 and 5, as well as highlight important directions of research. We review five methods used to quantitatively investigate these implications and how each method contributes to this literature: 1) controlled testbeds, 2) driving simulators and virtual reality, 3) agent-based and travel-demand models, 4) surveys, and 5) field experiments. We also present five critical research questions regarding the implications of AVs on the demand side of transportation and summarize findings from the current literature on: 1) what is the willingness to adopt the technology? and what are the impacts of the technology on 2) in-vehicle behavior? 3) value of time? 4) travel-related behaviors (activity pattern, mode, destination, residential location)? and 5) vehicle miles traveled (VMT)? Results can be divided into four categories. The first category corresponds to results on research questions with numerous data points where the direction of the impact is consistent across the literature, albeit the magnitude varies considerably. For instance, surveys indicate 19\% to 68\% of people are unwilling to adopt AV technology, a sentiment that is fading over time. Moreover, people prefer owning AVs over sharing them and don’t believe their car ownership will decrease. Regarding VMT, most studies predict an increase that varies from a low of 1\% to a high of 90\% depending on the scenario and assumptions under study. The second category of findings corresponds to research questions with limited and consistent, albeit highly variable data points. For example, a few stated preference survey studies indicate that reduced stress and multitasking during travel will reduce the value of time between 5\% and 90\%. The third category of results is on research questions with a few but conflicting data points. For instance, surveys indicate that people (80\% to 85\%) do not believe their residential location will be impacted by the adoption of AVs. Some simulation studies, however, indicate that lower travel costs will drive people away from cities and into suburbs while other studies report the opposite. The final category of results corresponds to research question with a single or no data points. For instance, one study explores how users will use vehicles to run errands while no studies investigate user preferences for vehicle types (e.g. mobile-homes vs. right-sized) or how they plan to use their vehicles when they are not needed (e.g. rent out vs. leave them idle). Moving forward, the goal is to shift all results into the first category while simultaneously tightening the prediction interval of the magnitude of the impacts. This can be achieved by: 1) focusing more efforts on research questions that fall under the three remaining categories to fill the holes in the literature, and 2) establishing consistency and clarity of assumptions used by researchers to enable comparisons and transferability of results.}

abstract = {The traffic jam phenomenon known as stop-and-go waves is commonplace on many roadways and is unavoidable due to the imperfect nature of human driving behaviour. Previous research by Stern et al. (2018) has demonstrated experimentally that a single Autonomous Vehicle (AV) can be harnessed to dissipate stop-and-go waves produced by 20 other passenger vehicles driving in a cycle. However, the experiment was conducted in an idealistic situation of a single-lane ring road with one AV; meaning no lane changing was possible and multiple AV interaction was left untested. To address these limitations, the AV driving behaviour used to achieve this, known as FollowerStopper (FS), was modelled for use in the Aimsun traffic simulation software and validated before further numerical experiments were conducted. The microsimulation scenarios were designed to observe how multiple AVs driven by the FS controller (referred to as FS-AVs in this paper) affect their traffic wave dissipation capability. Both single and double-lane ring roads experimental designs were used with the latter capturing the untested effect of lane changes. FS-AV was found to be less effective than originally documented in both cases. Multiple FS-AVs included within one lane were still able to improve traffic flow and dissipate the stop-and-go waves, although it is sensitive to the combination of different factors and any deviation away from the ideal condition is likely to produce worse-off traffic operations in terms of traffic flow. For double-lanes, human-driven vehicles (HDVs) would change lanes at heightened rates to occupy the larger gap the FS-AV needs for its dissipating strategy, causing it to further pullback and set off a chain reaction to upstream traffic. Stop-and-go waves had not been dissipated and decreased traffic performance in terms of flow, speed and delay time resulted. Our results also showed that the wave dampening effect of the FS-AV does not translate between the ring road and its linear equivalent. On the other hand, our preliminary simulation results using a real-life freeway model did not suggest multiple FS-AVs worsen traffic conditions. The contradicting results might be due to different traffic conditions such as vehicle density. Further research is required to investigate what factors could adversely affect FS-AV’s ability to dampen shockwaves and explore possible improvement to its driving algorithm.}

In light of increasing demand and crowding, the model can be used to assess the impact of near capacity operations on customers, evaluate system performance, and understand passenger behavior when choosing alternative routes. PIIM uses data from Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) and Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) systems and is applicable to general urban rail networks with entry and exit fare transactions. PIIM consists of three main modules: the left behind model, the route fractions inference model, and the inference model. The left behind model estimates the probability of any passenger being left behind by station and time interval. The route fractions inference model estimates the route choice fractions given the left behind probabilities. The inference model maps each pair of fare transaction records (entry and exit) to a set of feasible itineraries and infers the train(s) boarded by passengers based on the left behind probabilities and the route choice fractions. Synthetic data using AFC and AVL data from a major, congested urban rail system were generated to validate the model. The results show that the model accurately predicts the itineraries used by passengers, the left behind probabilities, route choice fractions, train loads, and other performance metrics of interest. PIIM is also used with actual data to illustrate its applicability.}

We use robust open-loop optimal control methodology at the flight planning level and incorporate meteorological uncertainties based on Ensemble Prediction System forecasts. Convective risk areas can be derived from the latter to be included in the objective function. At the execution level, the planned trajectories are included in an air traffic simulator (NAVSIM) under observed weather (wind and storms). In this simulation process, track modifications might be triggered in case of encountering an observed thunderstorm. A tool termed DIVMET based on pathfinding algorithms has been integrated into NAVSIM is considered to that end. Results show that planning robust trajectories (avoiding thus convective areas) reduces the number of storms encounters and increases predictability. This increase in predictability is at a cost in terms of fuel and time, also quantified.}

abstract = {In this study, we focus on how to optimize multi-type train scheduling problems in a practically available and computationally efficient manner. When solving the complicated train timetabling problem with overtaking operations for a congested high-speed rail corridor, a simplified approach is to predesignate a thin time interval from its origin station for each train. This setting is difficult and laborious in practice. What is more serious is that an imperfect setting may cause the expected solutions to be unreachable in many instances. To fundamentally get out of this thorny trouble, this study proposes a flexible scheduling framework that extends narrow time limitations to one-hour periods, which allows the trains to depart from any timestamp within the relaxed period. Further, a group of incompatibility constraints with a more compact form is formulated to mirror the coupling relation between train headway and regularity requirements. However, the relaxed time window increases the difficulty of obtaining the optimal or near-optimal solution under the standard Lagrangian-based decomposition framework. Therefore, an improved alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach is introduced for effectively eliminating the computational barriers that are due to its increased complexity. Specifically, a priority-based search sequence is employed by applying the associated dual costs during the solution of train-level path subproblems individually. Finally, a set of numerical experiments is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and availability of the proposed approach.}

From an algorithmic perspective, eco-routing opens up new possibilities regarding the strategies and tools aimed at improving energy efficiency by finding an energy-minimal route under different constraints coming from vehicle characteristics (powertrain, battery capacity, etc.) and user preferences (travel time, etc.). In this work, a powertrain-independent speed prediction model is presented. This model is then used to derive a fast numerical solution of the powertrain energy management for hybrid electric vehicles. Furthermore, a new general formulation is derived for the minimum-energy navigation problem, with a focus on the specific complexity introduced by electrified vehicles. The general constrained optimization problem is reformulated in several alternative ways in order to achieve a solution in limited computation time. The most commonly used approaches nowadays in the literature (integer programming and shortest path algorithms on directed graphs) are compared and benchmarked in terms of solution accuracy and computational effort. The objective is to identify best-practices in accurately and efficiently solving the constrained eco-routing problem.}

To this end, we firstly construct a multi-layer time–space network, in which each layer represents a duty. We then formulate the considered problem as a minimum-cost multi-commodity network flow problem in which each crew is regarded as a commodity and present a Lagrangian relaxation heuristic to solve the proposed network flow problem. Finally, we conduct a computational study using the real-life data to test the effectiveness of our Lagrangian relaxation heuristic, compare the performance of our heuristic with the benchmark solution, and report the benefits obtained via the proposed integrated optimization approach.}

Although advances have been made in understanding both the promotion of ADS trust and its impact on NDRT performance, the influence of risk remains largely understudied. To fill this gap, we conducted a within-subjects experiment with 37 licensed drivers using a simulator. Internal risk was manipulated by ADS reliability and external risk by visibility, producing a 2 (ADS reliability) × 2 (visibility) design. The results indicate that high reliability increases ADS trust and further enhances the positive impact of ADS trust on NDRT performance, while low visibility reduces the negative impact of ADS trust on driver monitoring. Results also suggest that trust increases over time if the system is reliable and that visibility did not have a significant impact on ADS trust. These findings are important for the design of intelligent ADSs that can respond to drivers’ trusting behaviors.}

We select the epidemiological characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a case study along with smart card data from Singapore to illustrate the model at the metropolitan level. A scalable and lightweight theoretical framework is derived to capture the time-varying and heterogeneous network structures, which enables to solve the problem at the whole population level with low computational costs. Different control policies from both the public health side and the transportation side are evaluated. We find that people’s preventative behavior is one of the most effective measures to control the spreading of epidemics. From the transportation side, partial closure of bus routes helps to slow down but cannot fully contain the spreading of epidemics. Identifying “influential passengers” using the smart card data and isolating them at an early stage can also effectively reduce the epidemic spreading.}

However, UAV-based delivery services are limited by several binding factors, such as low battery capacities and short delivery range, which in turn require simultaneous use of a large fleet for commercial scale operations. In such cases, congestion in low-altitude air will inevitably arise. This paper investigates self-organized UAV traffic flow in low altitude 3D airspace, and formulates the user equilibrium condition as a set of partial differential equations. We propose a finite element scheme to numerically solve the traffic equilibrium and compute system performance. Two specific test scenarios for last-mile freight delivery systems are studied, including one with a conventional ground-based distribution facility, and the other with a novel concept of airborne fulfillment center. We evaluate the operational cost and energy consumption of these systems under a variety of system configurations. The results provide insights that could be useful for logistic carriers and policy makers to achieve efficiency and sustainability for last-mile delivery.}

In theory, higher jam densities than those currently observed in practice are feasible. This leads to our hypothesis that the delay at intersections can be further reduced when cyclists are encouraged to queue up closer together. To explore this option, we carried out an experiment in which the queue configuration was influenced to increase the jam density. This paper presents ways to increase the queuing density, up to twice the density found without instructions. Results show that increasing the jam density does indeed increase the queue discharge rate; this also holds for jam density values that exceed those observed in normal queuing conditions. The efficiency of the queue discharge process, captured by the discharge rate, was found to increase by 40\% when cyclists queue up closely together. Qualitative comparison of the queuing positions and discharge patterns showed that the discharge sequence is largely determined by the queuing position, and that cyclists keep a distance from each other in both time and space during the queue discharge phase. When applied in practice, these findings can be used to update the signal length and green phases for all traffic, thereby reducing congestion in urban areas.}

Proportional fairness attempts to meet social fairness among evacuees without sacrificing the efficiency of the evacuation process. The proportional fair trip planning concept is compared to the commonly used maximum safety concept that attempts to maximize the summation of safety functions of evacuees. We use a combinatorial approach to model the transit mass emergency evacuation in moving people from dangerous areas to safe shelters. High-density population and medium-density population variations of the problem are studied. For each variation of the problem, we study the computational complexity of the problem. We develop polynomial or pseudo-polynomial algorithms for each problem. Our numerical analysis shows that pure consideration of efficiency may result in highly unfair plans that only consider the portion of the population with the most payoffs (e.g., the population with the highest danger level) while ignoring the rest (potentially the vast majority of the population). While still considering efficiency, proportional fairness is shown to address this issue by also allocating resources to the population that has non-optimal payoffs.}

Given a public event produces complicated spatiotemporal traffic impacts, existing data-driven approaches without involving traffic flow analysis show limited effectiveness to predict a public event. Motivated by this view, this study seeks to develop a domain-knowledge-based learning approach, which integrates shock wave analysis into deep learning models to predict the occurring of an upcoming public event (i.e., the SW-DLM approach). This integration raises new research challenging and calls for new approaches. Specifically, we develop an efficient algorithm to generate the shock wave diagrams to present the evolvement of the traffic anomaly, which expands whenever new traffic data is collected. Next, the shock wave diagram itself is not a well-coded input for feature extraction and learning. This study thus developed an innovative encoding approach, which transforms a shock wave diagram into an optimal pixel grid. Considering the features extracted from the encoded shock wave diagrams are fed into the long-short term memory (LSTM) model for the event prediction. The numerical experiments based on the field data indicate that the SW-DLM is able to predict a public event with 87\% accuracy around 84 min before it starts in a day. It outperforms all data-driven machine learning models using point traffic data as inputs. Thus, we claim that using the shock wave diagrams can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of the learning approaches for predicting a public event. The SW-DLM will help develop preventive traffic control or route plans to avoid traffic congestion induced by public events.}

This study makes use of a national survey conducted by the Pew Research Center to identify the affective, socio-demographic and technology-use attributes that affect an individual’s perception of the safety of sharing the road with AVs (PSSRAV) and identifies measures and interventions that can be undertaken to improve PSSRAV. Additionally, we evaluate individual preferences for AV regulations. Our results underscore the importance of the need for service providers and public agencies to be cognizant of the demographic and lifestyle/affective emotion considerations shaping AV safety perceptions and opinions about AV regulations. In particular, there is a need not only to focus on technological and other infrastructure components of AV development, but also to recognize the socio-technical considerations and human-related factors of the end-users. Our findings should be of substantial interest in the planning, design, deployment, and introduction of AVs within a safe and minimally regulated public operating arena.}

However, most of the existing studies focus on the region-level demand prediction while only a few attempts to address the problem of origin–destination (OD) demand prediction. In this paper, from the graph aspects, we construct the dynamic OD graphs to describe the ride-hailing demand data. We propose a novel neural architecture named the Dynamic Node-Edge Attention Network (DNEAT) to address the unique challenges of OD demand prediction from the demand generation and attraction perspectives. Different from previous studies, in DNEAT, we develop a new neural layer, named k-hop temporal node-edge attention layer (k-TNEAT), to capture the temporal evolution of node topologies in dynamic OD graphs instead of the pre-defined relationships among regions. We evaluate our model on two real-world ride-hailing demand datasets (from Chengdu, China, and New York City). The experiment results show that the proposed model outperforms six baseline models and is more robust to demand data with high sparsity.}

abstract = {Emerging technologies in cargo shipping delivery have provided a way to facilitate horizontal cooperation in the transportation of goods to reduce the shipping cost of the cooperating firms, but an open question in this cooperation is how to allocate the costs fairly among the participants. In this paper, we focus on routing in real time a fleet of capacitated vehicles to satisfy requests submitted by a set of customers with some of the requests unknown while assigning the service cost fairly among the requested customers. We propose a Hybrid Proportional Online Cost-Sharing (HPOCS) mechanism to tackle the cost-sharing problem and analyze its performance using simulation instances. Although HPOCS does satisfy the desirable properties, namely online fairness, budget balance, immediate response, individual rationality and ex-post incentive compatibility, it has a few drawbacks in certain scenarios. Therefore, we make two extensions to HPOCS: 1) we introduce the idea of discounts to encourage customers to request in advance to facilitate efficient vehicle routing; 2) we incorporate periodical re-optimization within the dynamic vehicle routing framework. Experimental analysis are made in both extensions to see the tradeoff between the performance and the loss of certain desirable properties.}

abstract = {Simulation-based optimization (SO or SBO) has become increasingly important to address challenging transportation network design problems. In this paper, we propose to solve two toll pricing problems with different levels of complexity using the concept of the macroscopic or network fundamental diagram (MFD or NFD), where a large-scale simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment model of Melbourne, Australia is used. Four computationally efficient SBO methods are applied and compared, including the proportional-integral (PI) controller, regressing kriging (RK), DIviding RECTangles (DIRECT), and simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA). The comparison reveals that these methods work equally well on the simple problem without exhibiting significant performance differences. But, for the complex problem, RK manifests itself to be the best-performing method thanks to its capability of filtering out the numerical noise arising from computer simulations (i.e. allowing for non-smoothness of the objective function). While the PI controller is a more competitive solution to the simple problem given its faster rate of convergence, the poor scalability of the method in the complex problem results in limited applicability. Two caveats, however, deserve emphasis: (i) the chosen critical network density of the NFD does not necessarily represent a robust network control or optimization threshold, as it might shift in the presence of toll pricing; and (ii) re-interpolation is required as part of RK in order to achieve global convergence.}

Although many studies have found that, theoretically, ACC vehicles may have positive impacts on traffic string stability and throughput, recent studies reveal that commercially-available ACC vehicles are string unstable. However, it is still not clear what impacts on highway traffic these commercially-available ACC vehicles may have at higher market penetration rates. Therefore, the objective of this study is twofold: (i) investigate the impacts on highway traffic capacity of mixed human-piloted vehicles and theoretical ACC vehicles as well as commercially-available ACC vehicles at different market penetration rates; (ii) explore the potential relationship between string stability and highway throughput. We use the intelligent driver model with calibrated parameter values from car following data collected on commercially-available ACC vehicles and compare the simulation results to simulations conducted using a theoretical ACC vehicle model with parameter values obtained in the literature. The results show that when simulating ACC vehicles found in the literature,traffic flow is string stable and the bottleneck capacity increases by up to 7\% at higher market penetration rates as compared to homogeneous human driven traffic. When commercially-available ACC vehicles are simulated, the traffic flow is string unstable and the bottleneck capacity decreases at higher market penetration rates with some scenarios resulting in a decrease in capacity of up to 35\%. The analysis provides evidence that bottleneck capacity is substantially affected by string stability and inter-vehicle time gap, while downstream throughput is solely influenced by time gap.}

Demand prediction is one of the most fundamental components in supply-demand management systems of ride-sourcing platforms. With an accurate short-term prediction for origin-destination (OD) demand, the platforms make precise and timely decisions on real-time matching, idle vehicle reallocations, and ride-sharing vehicle routing, etc. Compared to the zone-based demand prediction that has been examined in many previous studies, OD-based demand prediction is more challenging. This is mainly due to the complicated spatial and temporal dependencies among the demand of different OD pairs. To overcome this challenge, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Encoder-Decoder Residual Multi-Graph Convolutional network (ST-ED-RMGC), a novel deep learning model for predicting ride-sourcing demand of various OD pairs. Firstly, the model constructs OD graphs, which utilize adjacent matrices to characterize the non-Euclidean pair-wise geographical and semantic correlations among different OD pairs. Secondly, based on the constructed graphs, a residual multi-graph convolutional (RMGC) network is designed to encode the contextual-aware spatial dependencies, and a long-short term memory (LSTM) network is used to encode the temporal dependencies, into a dense vector space. Finally, we reuse the RMGC networks to decode the compressed vector back to OD graphs and predict the future OD demand. Through extensive experiments on the for-hire-vehicles datasets in Manhattan, New York City, we show that our proposed deep learning framework outperforms the state-of-arts by a significant margin.}

However, previous methods of pedestrian volume collection require either time-consuming ground-truth data collection, or the purchase and maintenance of costly sensors in a large-scale application. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel method for large-scale pedestrian estimation at midblock crosswalks using button-pushing and signal timing events. The pedestrian arrival is modeled as a Poisson process, and two submethods are developed to estimate pedestrian volume at one-stage and two-stage button-activated midblock crosswalks (BAMCs). To address the issue of missing signal cycles at two-stage BAMCs, all missing cycles that are identified by using the proposed paired signal cycle identification algorithm are accounted for and added by minimizing the error between estimation results of two stages. Eight days of the ground-truth pedestrian volume is manually collected from two study midblock crosswalks to evaluate the proposed methods. On average, 235 and 230 pedestrians per day were observed to cross the one-stage BAMC and two-stage BAMC, respectively. The average mean absolute error of estimated pedestrian volume using a one-hour interval is 2.27 and 1.78 ped/hour at two study locations, respectively. The evaluation results indicate that the proposed methods are promising for estimating pedestrian volume at midblock crosswalks using event-based data. A further sensitivity analysis of changing the estimation interval shows that the one-hour interval pedestrian volume estimation is recommended as having the least error.}

The arrival distribution was generated using a platoon dispersion model. A stationary condition was defined, in which the performance of the CLL design remained stable in any stationary cycle. It has proved that the CLL system always converges to the stationary condition after a few cycles if the arrival distribution is fixed. In stationary cycles, the CLL design generates either recurrent and constant residual queues or no queues, depending on the arrival distributions of left-turning vehicles. Based on the stationary condition, analytical models were developed to estimate the operational performance for left-turns at signalized intersections with the CLL design. The results show that both the arrival pattern and the length of the contraflow lane can significantly influence the operational performance of the CLL design. The residual queues in the stationary condition could increase control delay significantly, leading to an overlong delay of the left-turning vehicles if the contraflow lane was not carefully designed. To this end, an empirical optimization method was proposed to minimize the control delay by optimizing the length of contraflow lanes and the offset between adjacent intersections. The research results can be directly employed by traffic engineers to optimize the CLL design and to estimate the operational performance of the signalized intersections with the CLL design.}

While a range of methods has been used in the past for driving style classification, the emergence of connected vehicles equipped with communication devices provides a new opportunity to classify driving style using high-resolution (10 Hz) microscopic real-world data. In this study, location-based big data and machine learning are used to classify driving styles ranging from aggressive to calm. This classification can be used to customize driver assistance systems, assess mobility, crash risk, fuel consumption, and emissions. This study’s main objective is to develop a framework that harnesses Basic Safety Messages (BSMs) generated by connected vehicles to quantify instantaneous driving behavior and classify driving styles in different spatial contexts using unsupervised machine learning methods. To this end, a subset of the Safety Pilot Model Deployment (SPMD) with more than 27 million BSM observations generated by more than 1300 individuals making trips on diverse roadways and through several neighborhoods in Ann Arbor, Michigan, were processed and analyzed. To quantify driving style, the concept of temporal driving volatility, as a surrogate safety measure of unsafe driving behavior, was utilized and applied to vehicle kinematics, i.e., observed speeds and longitudinal/lateral accelerations. Specifically, six volatility measures are extracted and used for classifying drivers. K-means and K-medoids methods are applied for grouping drivers in aggressive, normal, and calm clusters. Clustering results indicate that not only does driving style vary among drivers, but the thresholds for aggressive and calm driving vary across different roadway types due to variations in environment and road conditions. The proportion of aggressive driving styles was also higher on commercial streets than on highways and residential streets. Notably, we propose a Driving Score to measure driving performance consistently across drivers.}

Specifically, the analytical formulations of the capacity and flow stability are developed considering the maximum platoon size. Simulations are conducted to verify the developed theoretical models. For capacity analysis, both the analytical and simulation results indicate that a larger maximum platoon size can help increase the capacity. However, the increment becomes smaller with the increase of maximum platoon size. For flow stability analysis, the theoretical analysis and microscopic simulation show that smaller maximum platoon size leads to greater traffic flow stabilization. In addition, analysis shows that improvements in capacity and traffic stability are more profound when CAV penetration and platooning intensity are high.}

To deal with this, they either drive to a park-and-ride location to take transit, use carpooling, or drive directly to their destination to avoid inconvenience. Ridesharing, an emerging mode of transportation, can solve the transit first mile/last mile problem. In this setup, a driver can drive a ride-seeker to a transit station, from where the rider can take transit to her respective destination. The problem requires solving a ridesharing matching problem with the routing of riders in a multimodal transportation network. We develop a transit-based ridesharing matching algorithm to solve this problem. The method leverages the schedule-based transit shortest path to generate feasible matches and then solves a matching optimization program to find an optimal match between riders and drivers. The proposed method not only assigns an optimal driver to the rider but also assigns an optimal transit stop and a transit vehicle trip departing from that stop for the rest of the rider’s itinerary. We also introduce the application of space-time prism (STP) (the geographical area which can be reached by a traveler given the time constraints) in the context of ridesharing to reduce the computational time by reducing the network search. An algorithm to solve this problem dynamically using a rolling horizon approach is also presented. We use simulated data obtained from the activity-based travel demand model of Twin Cities, MN to show that the transit-based ridesharing can solve the FMLM problem and save a significant number of vehicle-hours spent in the system.}

abstract = {Surrogate Safety Measures (SSMs) are widely used to assess potential crash risk proactively. Notably, most of the existing safety indicators are fundamentally designed to capture the rear-end collision risk. However, in reality, the traffic dynamics involve the simultaneous interaction of multiple vehicles on a 2-dimensional (2D) surface, which results in a broad spectrum of collision patterns, such as head-on, side-swipe, rear-end, and angled collisions. This study proposes a novel 2D surrogate safety indicator called Anticipated Collision Time (ACT) to capture the risk pattern corresponding to all collision types using a single measure. We also devised a procedure to automatically detect conflict situations and extract ACT profiles as well as crash-type information from the trajectory data. The primary inputs to the ACT estimation are the shortest distance between the vehicles and the closing-in rate. This study also introduces another safety indicator derived from the ACT profile called Time of Evasive Action (TEA). TEA primarily captures the time at which a vehicle commences to respond, in terms of deceleration, when it encounters an unsafe situation. Such a measure helps to understand the response pattern of different vehicles/drivers to a potential collision. We also derived Time Exposed ACT (TE-ACT) and Time Integrated ACT (TI-ACT) from the ACT profile to capture crash exposure and severity. To highlight the potential of ACT, the Powered Two Wheeler (PTW) safety in an urban environment was analyzed with trajectory data collected from a busy urban midblock section. The results emphasize the capabilities of ACT and the other derived indicators to capture crash risk proactively. It is incontrovertible from the analyses that the ACT is opening up a new avenue for a comprehensive investigation of the safety of various transport facilities, irrespective of geometry and traffic scenario.}

abstract = {The optimal routing of a single vacant taxi is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem to account for profit maximization over a full working period in a transportation network. A batch offline reinforcement learning (RL) method is proposed to learn action values and the optimal policy from archived trajectory data. The method is model-free, in that no state transition model is needed. It is more efficient than the commonly used online RL methods based on interactions with a simulator, due to batch processing and reuse of transition experiences. The batch RL method is evaluated in a large network of Shanghai, China with GPS trajectories of over 12,000 taxis. The training is conducted with two datasets: one is a synthetic dataset where state transitions are generated in a simulator with a postulated system dynamics model (Yu et al., 2019) whose parameters are derived from observed data; the other contains real-world state transitions extracted from observed taxi trajectories. The batch RL method is more computationally efficient, reducing the training time by dozens of times compared with the online Q-learning method. Its performance in terms of average profit per hour and occupancy rate is assessed in the simulator, against that of a baseline model, the random walk, and an upper bound, generated by the exact Dynamic Programming (DP) method based on the same system model of the simulator. The batch RL based on simulated and observed trajectories both outperform the random walk, and the advantage increases with the training sample size. The batch RL based on simulated trajectories achieves 95\% of the performance upper bound with 30-minutes time intervals, suggesting that the model-free method is highly effective. The batch RL based on observed data achieves around 90\% of the performance upper bound with 30-minute time intervals, due to the discrepancy between the training and evaluation environments, and its performance in the real world is expected to similarly good since the training and evaluation would be based on the same environment.}

We refer to this as the Nested-Vehicle Routing Problem (Nested-VRP) and develop a Mixed Integer Quadratically Constrained Programming (MIQCP) formulation with critical operational constraints, including drone battery capacity and synchronization of both vehicles during scheduled rendezvous. An enhancement of the MIQCP model for the Nested-VRP is achieved by deriving the equivalent Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation as well as leveraging lifting and Reformulation-Linearization techniques to strengthen the subtour elimination constraints of the drone. Given the NP-hard nature of the Nested-VRP, we further propose an efficient neighborhood search (NS) heuristic where we generate and improve on a good initial solution by iteratively solving the Nested-VRP on a local scale. We provide comparisons of both the exact approaches based on MIQCP or its enhanced formulations and NS heuristic methods with a relaxation lower bound in the cases of small and large problem sizes, and present the results of a computational study to show the effectiveness of the MIQCP model and its variants as well as the efficiency of the NS heuristic, including for a real-life instance with 631 locations.

There is a need to understand the e-scooter demand patterns and users’ characteristics to develop adequate policies and regulations. In this research, we consider the problem of modeling the interaction of e-scooters and bus transit services and provide an overview of e-scooter trips and user characteristics. We use a revealed-preference survey to evaluate the e-scooter usage in one of the highest-demand areas in the City of Austin, corresponding to a university campus. We explore population characteristics, mode shift, and mode interaction. Then, using publicly available datasets, we provide a causal analysis to evaluate the nature of the relationship between e-scooter and transit trips in the whole city. Assessing this relationship is challenging because several factors affect the demand of both types of trips (e.g., location of attractive zones), known as confounding variables. We develop a methodological framework to isolate the effects of confounding variables on transit trips using a two-stage regression procedure. The first stage aims to isolate confounding variables using a gradient boosting regression. The second stage models first and last-mile trips using a negative binomial and a zero-inflated negative binomial count model. The university survey indicated that 12 percent of the e-scooter users employed transit to complement their trips. Although small in magnitude, the data modeling results show that a statistically significant relationship was found on the university campus and downtown areas, supporting the survey results and extending the analysis to other areas of the city. However, the overall interaction between the two modes has a small magnitude. The proposed methodology can be used to identify areas with potential e-scooter and transit interaction.}

Researchers have extensively studied how AVs drive along highways. Nonetheless, how AVs navigate intersections in urban environments remains a challenging task due to the constant presence of moving road users, including turning vehicles, crossing or jaywalking pedestrians, and cyclists. AVs are thus required to learn and adapt to a dynamically evolving urban traffic environment. This paper proposes a design benchmark that allows AVs to sense the real-time traffic environment and perform path planning. The agent dynamically generates curves for feasible paths. The ego vehicle attempts to follow these paths under specific constraints. RL and MPC navigation algorithms run in parallel and are suitably selected to enhance ego vehicle safety. The ego AV is modeled with lateral and longitudinal dynamics and trained in a T-intersection using the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm under various traffic scenarios. It is then tested on a straight road and a single or multi-lane intersections. All these experiments achieve desirable outcomes in terms of crash avoidance, driving efficiency, comfort, and tracking accuracy. The developed AV navigation system provides a design benchmark for an adaptive AV that can navigate unsignalized intersections.}

abstract = {Connected vehicles (CVs) can considerably contribute to traffic control in the near future by providing real-time information. Such information can be exploited to identify the current traffic condition. However, challenges resulting from a high volume of data and lack of perfect knowledge in mixed traffic scenarios (consisting of CVs and conventional vehicles) have led to relatively sparse research in network-wide CV-based traffic control. To deal with such challenges, this paper proposes a hierarchical framework integrating three layers: (i) an intersection controller at individual intersections located in the center of the network, (ii) a network controller to regulate traffic coming into the network, and (iii) a phase controller to optimize the sequence of intersections’ signals. This approach permits the inclusion of information of (a limited number of) CVs to estimate and control queue lengths at individual intersections as well as the overall network load. Simulations carried out in VISSIM validate our approach in comparison with alternative control systems such as the application of (1) a traffic-responsive control, (2) a traffic accumulation regulator, or (3) a network signals coordinator. Moreover, comparisons between the proposed framework and a central system equipped with the information of all vehicles (giving rise to the optimal operation with, however, costly computation) under the consideration of different penetration rates of CVs and network layouts confirm that this framework results in competitive performance indicators, which, owing to the hierarchical structure, can be efficiently employed in real-time applications.}

abstract = {With well-defined graphs, graph convolution based spatiotemporal neural networks for traffic prediction have achieved great performance in numerous tasks. Compared to other methods, the networks can exploit the latent spatial dependencies between nodes according to the adjacency relationship. However, as the topological structure of the real road network tends to be intricate, it is difficult to accurately quantify the correlations between nodes in advance. In this paper, we propose a graph convolutional network based adaptive graph learning algorithm (AdapGL) to acquire the complex dependencies. First, by developing a novel graph learning module, more possible correlations between nodes can be adaptively captured during training. Second, inspired by the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, the parameters of the prediction network module and the graph learning module are optimized by alternate training. An elaborate loss function is leveraged for graph learning to ensure the sparsity of the generated affinity matrix. In this way, the expectation maximization of one part can be realized under the condition that the other part is the best estimate. Finally, the graph structure is updated by a weighted sum approach. The proposed algorithm can be applied to most graph convolution based networks for traffic forecast. Experimental results demonstrated that our method can not only further improve the accuracy of traffic prediction, but also effectively exploit the hidden correlations of the nodes.

In public transport networks, replacing internal combustion engine buses by electric buses provides an opportunity to improve air quality. Hence, many bus network operators currently ask for an optimal transformation plan to integrate battery electric buses into their fleet. Ideally, this plan also considers the installation of necessary charging infrastructure to ensure a fleet’s operational feasibility. Against this background, we introduce an integrated modeling approach to determine a cost-optimal, long-term, multi-period transformation plan for integrating battery electric buses into urban bus networks. Our model connects central strategic and operational decisions. We minimize total cost of ownership and analyze potential reductions of nitrogen oxide emissions. Our results base on a case study of a real-world bus network and show that a comprehensive integration of battery electric buses is feasible and economically beneficial. By analyzing the impact of battery capacities and charging power on the optimal fleet transformation, we show that medium-power charging facilities combined with medium-capacity batteries are superior to networks with low-power or high-power charging facilities.}

abstract = {Unplanned disruptions to urban rail systems can result in widespread confusion and severe delays, and running bus bridging service is a common solution. Currently, transit operators usually adopt experience-based response strategy in such a way that spare buses from bus terminals and parking lots are used to run bus bridging services. Such a response approach can be effective when there are spare buses available at nearby terminals/parking lots. However, in case spare buses are not available or enough, it could be beneficial to dispatch running buses from nearby operating bus lines to ensure efficient response while incurring minimal inconvenience to on-board passengers. While this approach could reduce metro users’ delays, it causes extra delays and dissatisfaction to affected bus riders. In this study, we investigate the optimal bus dispatching problem for responding to unplanned disruptions of urban rail transit system with two bus fleet sources: (1) spare buses at terminals and parking lots, and (2) running buses from nearby operating bus lines. To obtain the optimal dispatching scheme, we develop an integer programming model, which achieves a balance between the delays of metro users and that of bus riders. Considering of the high uncertainty of bus headways which could affect the performance of the above deterministic model, we further develop a robust optimization model to obtain more reliable bus dispatching schemes. Case studies based on the data sets in Shanghai are conducted. The results demonstrate that our approach can be carried out in real-time, and employing running buses from operating bus lines shows great potential in reducing affected users’ delays. In addition, the robust model offers a more reliable and competitive solution when the headway varies widely.}

To quantify the impacts of CAV technology on vehicle market penetration and travelers’ route choices in the future from the perspective of transportation planning, this paper investigates a two-sided market equilibrium problem, which considers the vehicle market on one side and the road traffic equilibrium market on the other side. The two markets interactively affect each other through market penetration, information quality, and spatial distribution of congestion, which are all endogenously determined in our model. In the vehicle market, two-stage decision-making is considered to describe various vehicle choices users may face in the future. In the first stage, users between each origin–destination (OD) pair choose a vehicle type between HV and CAV. In the second stage, CAV users further choose a vehicle automaton level. To account for the similarity of CAVs with different automation levels, we use a nested logit (NL) model to capture the two-stage decision-making. A vehicle choice with a higher market penetration provides higher-quality information, which affects the traffic equilibrium market. For the traffic equilibrium, route choices of users with different information quality are described by a multinomial logit (MNL) model. The spatial distribution of congestion determined by the traffic equilibrium also affects vehicle choices in the vehicle market. Specifically, users with higher quality information are more likely to choose routes with the lowest travel time. Consequently, a vehicle choice with a lower expected travel time attracts more users. The two-sided market equilibrium is formulated as a combined NL-MNL model so as to solve the two interactive market equilibria simultaneously. Then, we explore the properties of the equilibrium state. Sufficient and necessary conditions for the path flow pattern and demand pattern at equilibrium are derived, respectively. Based on the properties of the equilibrium state, we derive an equivalent variational inequality (VI) for the combined NL-MNL model. A new approach is provided to deriving two sufficient conditions, either of which guarantees the uniqueness of the VI solution. To solve the proposed problem efficiently, we develop a path-based modified self-regulated averaging (PMSRA) algorithm embedded with a modified K-shortest path method. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to analyze the effects of CAV technology and demonstrate algorithm efficiency. Sensitivity analysis of parameters in the algorithm is also performed. Our results show that the market penetration of CAVs at the early stage of introduction is low due to the high purchase cost. With the development of CAV technology and mass production, fully automated CAVs may gradually dominate the market, while partially automated CAVs tend to be squeezed out of the market. In addition, our results reveal that the travel time saving from CAV technology and high-quality information is more pronounced for long trips and congested networks.}

Understanding a city’s transportation typology is immensely valuable for planners and policy makers whose decisions can potentially impact millions of city residents. Despite the value of understanding a city’s typology, labeled data (city and its typology) is scarce, and spans at most a few hundred cities in the current transportation literature. To break this barrier, we propose a supervised machine learning approach to predict a city’s typology given the information in its Wikipedia page. Our method leverages recent breakthroughs in natural language processing, namely sentence-BERT, and shows how the text-based information from Wikipedia can be effectively used as a data source for city typology prediction tasks that can be applied to over 2000 cities worldwide. We propose a novel method for low-dimensional city representation using a city’s Wikipedia page, which makes supervised learning of city typology labels tractable even with a few hundred labeled samples. These features are used with labeled city samples to train binary classifiers (logistic regression) for four different city typologies: (i) congestion, (ii) auto-heavy, (iii) transit-heavy, and (iv) bike-friendly cities resulting in reasonably high AUC scores of 0.87, 0.86, 0.61 and 0.94 respectively. Our approach provides sufficient flexibility for incorporating additional variables in the city typology models and can be applied to study other city typologies as well. Our findings can assist a diverse group of stakeholders in transportation and urban planning fields, and opens up new opportunities for using text-based information from Wikipedia (or similar platforms) as data sources in such fields.}

To this aim, a general modelling framework is proposed, in which ACC and CF models have been incrementally augmented with physics-based extensions: namely, perception delay, linear or nonlinear vehicle dynamics, and acceleration constraints. This framework has been applied to the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM), Gipps’ model, and to three basic ACC algorithms. These are linear controllers which are coupled with a constant time-headway spacing policy, and with two other policies derived from the traffic flow theory: the IDM desired distance function, and Gipps’ equilibrium distance-speed function. The ninety models resulting from the combination of the five base models with the aforementioned extensions, have been assessed and compared through a vast calibration and validation experiment against measured trajectory data of vehicles driven by ACC systems. Overall, the study has shown that physics-based extensions provide limited improvements to the accuracy of existing models. In addition, if an investigation against measured data is not carried out, it is not possible to argue which extension is the most suited for a specific model. The linear controller with Gipps’ spacing policy has resulted the most accurate model, while the IDM the most robust to different input trajectories. Eventually, all models have failed to capture the behaviour of some car brands – just as models fail with some human drivers. Therefore, the choice of the “best” model is independent of the car brand to simulate.}

Most proposed formulations are based on static models and thus do not account for the congestion dynamics. This paper considers elastic demand and implements a static TCS to foster modal shift by restricting the number of cars allowed in the network over the day while remaining easy to understand and implement. A trip-based Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) model represents the traffic dynamics at the whole urban scale. We assume the users have different OD pairs and choose between driving their car or riding the transit following a logit model. We aim to compute the modal shares and credit price at equilibrium under TCS. The travel times are linearized with respect to the modal shares to derive the stochastic user equilibrium with low computation times. We then present a method to find the credit charge minimizing the total travel time alone or combined with the carbon emissions. We also show that traffic dynamics and trip heterogeneity lead to different network equilibriums under TCS. It highlights the limitations of classical static representations. The proposed framework is applied to a realistic large-scale scenario: the peak hour (7:00–10:00) in Lyon Metropolis, including 384 200 travelers. Under an optimized TCS, the total travel time decreases by 17\% and the carbon emissions by 45\% by increasing the PT share by 24 points.}

Advancements in connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) provide opportunities for developing applications to send advisory messages directly to CAVs, which provides an efficient way of managing traffic. This research develops an enhanced CAV based lane management and control application to overcome the limitations of infrastructure-based systems and improve operations, fuel efficiency, and safety in a mixed autonomy operation of CAVs and human-driven vehicles. Impacts of this approach on operations, fuel efficiency, and safety are compared to traditional LMS using a calibrated simulation model of a site where traditional LMS is present. High fidelity simulation runs of drive cycles were conducted using the Autonomie® model to estimate fuel efficiency effects. The simulation results showed that starting at a lower penetration of 20\% CAVs, an average throughput improvement of 3.5\% was observed, increasing to a maximum of 14.2\% for full penetration of CAVs. The drive cycle simulations revealed a reduction of 47\% to 60\% in fuel consumption with the CAV based application. Both lane change and rear-end conflicts were also observed to reduce. Likewise, volatility represented by acceleration-deceleration variation, was reduced by an average of 18.2\% and 17.6\% under varying penetrations of CAVs. Volatility represents variation in driving regimes over an instantaneous period of driving, so this reduction in volatility serves as a positive surrogate indicator of safety and fuel efficiency for this new application as well.}

This paper distinguishes users’ work-related and home-related activities in autonomous cars and proposes an activity-based bottleneck model to investigate travelers’ behavior in the morning commute, shedding light on how the scope to undertake in-vehicle activities affects travelers’ trip-timing preferences and decisions, and therewith social welfare. These welfare effects can be expected to depend on the optimality of both the market for trips, and the market for vehicles. We therefore consider different supply regimes for vehicles, as well as unpriced congestion versus queue-eliminating road pricing. We reveal analytically the relationship between various in-vehicle activities and trip-timing decisions by users of autonomous and normal cars. Three supply regimes for autonomous cars are investigated: welfare-maximizing public supply, competitive marginal cost supply, and profit-maximizing private supply. Pricing rules under different supply regimes are compared analytically, and the relative efficiencies in terms of the welfare gains are compared numerically. The results show that travelers’ in-vehicle activity choices have significant impacts on travel patterns, congestion externality, supply decisions, and the associated welfare effects.}

As an essential enabler to meet these challenges, pre-flight 4D routes optimization is required to conduct conflict detection and resolution (CD&R) and to generate conflict-free flight routes before departure. Existing studies on strategic deconfliction cover several types of strategies such as scheduling or rerouting. However, a single type of strategy used to solve different types of conflicts may lead to an unsafe and inefficient way of conflict resolution. This paper proposes an adaptive decision-making framework to optimize the resolution strategies used for different types of conflicts with explainable mechanisms. The proposed framework is formulated as a double-layer optimization problem with the considerations of scheduling, speed adjustment, and rerouting strategies for conflict resolution. The first layer of the framework is established as a probabilistic selection model to make decisions on which strategy should be selected for what type of conflict. The second layer is developed as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model to optimize the decision variables of the strategies selected by the first layer. To solve the proposed double-layer optimization problem, we introduce and improve a novel meta-heuristic stochastic fractal search (SFS) algorithm with two major improvements of a penalty-guided fitness function and an exploitation-exploration balancing scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive conflict resolution framework successfully optimizes the strategies used for each type of flight conflict, which subsequently optimizes the 4D routes with significant reductions in total operational cost, number of flight conflicts, and flight delays. The improved stochastic fractal search (ISFS) algorithm is also proved effective and reliable in solving the proposed optimization problem in different traffic density scenarios.}

As the growth of on-demand mobility services and the advent of shared autonomous vehicles are envisioned to boost the presence of ridesharing vehicles, these may soon significantly affect traffic patterns in our cities. However, most previous studies investigating dynamic ridesharing systems overlook the effects on travel times due to the assignment of requests to vehicles and their routes. In order to assign the ridesharing vehicles while considering network traffic dynamics, we propose a strategy that incorporates time-dependent link travel time predictions into the request–vehicle assignment to avoid or mitigate traffic congestion. In particular, we formulate an efficient linear assignment problem that considers multiple path alternatives and accounts for the impact on travel times, which may be potentially caused by vehicles assigned to specific routes. Simulation experiments reveal that using an appropriate congestion avoidance ridesharing strategy can remarkably reduce passenger average travel and waiting times by alleviating endogenous congestion caused by ridesharing fleets.}

They fail to meet the time-varying travel demand and do not consider the diversified characteristics of transit passengers. With the advent of the information era, communication among passengers, buses, and dispatching centers has become much easier. Accordingly, demand-responsive bus dispatching methods are expected to increase the flexibility of operation schemes to improve the performance of shuttle bus systems. To this end, this study proposes a mixed-integer linear programming model to incorporate ride-matching and shuttle bus dispatching in one framework. The bus trip schedules (including the number of used bus trips of different types, departure times, dwelling stops with dwelling times, and recommended travel speeds between adjacent stops of each trip) and passenger-to-vehicle matching schemes are optimized. The commonly used stop-skipping tactic, speed adjustment, and bus holding strategies are introduced to improve the flexibility and operational efficiency of shuttle bus systems. The objective is to minimize the weighted total passenger waiting times, passenger in-vehicle times, and operating costs. A modified Lagrangian relaxation algorithm is designed to improve computational efficiency for large-scale problems. A rolling horizon scheme is designed to implement the algorithm dynamically. It updates the dispatching scheme horizon by horizon according to newly collected requests, which can also improve the algorithm performance by reducing the problem scale. Numerical results show that the proposed flexible multi-type shuttle bus system outperforms a multi-type bus timetabling algorithm in all the considered cases, and it outperforms an on-demand ride-sharing algorithm in 80\% of the cases.}

abstract = {Connected and autonomous vehicle technologies are expected to alter transportation systems by enhancements in mobility, safety, and emission reduction. While many studies have investigated the impacts of connected vehicle (CV) and autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies on traffic congestion and emission at the facility level, little is known about these impacts at large scales. Furthermore, different effective parameters associated with these impacts, such as the extra vehicle miles traveled (VMT) induced by AVs, technology cost of these vehicles, and possible reductions in the value of time of AV users, are highly uncertain. The uncertainty of these parameters and its role in assessing the societal impacts of CVs and AVs are not fully explored in the literature. Therefore, this study aims to develop a stochastic framework and an optimization algorithm to find the optimum market shares of CVs and AVs in a mixed traffic environment, consisting of human-driven vehicles without connectivity (HDVs), CVs, and AVs, minimizing the system cost. Emission, travel time, and technology costs are considered as components of the system cost. Thus, the framework combines a traffic simulation tool that considers a mixed fleet of HDVs, CVs, and AVs with heterogeneous drivers (for HDVs and CVs) distributed spatially over the network, along with an emission estimation model, to measure network-wide travel time and emission costs. Many parameters, such as extra VMT produced by AVs, value of time reduction for AV users, and automation cost, are subject to a considerable degree of stochasticity, which is considered by assuming probabilistic distributions for these parameters. A Bayesian Optimization algorithm with heteroskedastic non-stationary Gaussian process model is presented to estimate the optimum market shares of CVs and AVs considering these uncertainties. The stochastic framework and the optimization algorithm are successfully applied to a large-scale network of Chicago. The impacts of different parameters on the optimum CV and AV market shares and the system cost are explored, providing practical insights for policymakers.}

abstract = {Recorded aircraft trajectory data may vary significantly from predictions based on physics-informed models. This discrepancy may be attributed to inadequacies in the trajectory prediction models, including errors in modeling aircraft dynamics, and omission of inputs such as weather data, equipment malfunctions, and pilot errors. In this work, we represent model errors as additional external inputs to the trajectory prediction model, evaluate them using Bayesian state estimation, and update the trajectory prediction model to address these errors. In doing so, we distinguish between two types of model errors – transient and persistent errors – of which only persistent errors are considered for correction. In this study, we estimate the model error for the completed portion of ongoing flights, separate out the persistent error and account for it in the system model, which allows for an improved prediction of aircraft trajectory for the remaining flight duration. We perform verification and validation of the proposed methodology using both synthetically generated data as well as historically recorded data corresponding to flights affected by adverse weather conditions and engine failure.}

abstract = {This work focuses on traffic parameters estimation based on trajectory data in an arterial corridor with multiple signalized intersections. We develop a general framework that can combine various traffic flow models with Bayesian Network (BN) for estimating the overall traffic parameters using partially observed vehicle trajectory data (with unknown penetration rate). The BN is formulated to establish the probabilistic relationship between the traffic arrival process, traffic states, traffic flow model parameters and observed vehicle trajectories. More specifically, given traffic arrival information (e.g., traffic arrival volume) and fundamental diagram parameters (e.g., capacity, jam density, and free flow speed), vehicle trajectories are derived or simulated based on traffic flow modelling (e.g., shockwave analysis, Cell Transmission Model (CTM), or microscopic traffic simulation model VISSIM). Here, the extracted entry time of an observed vehicle at a pre-defined location upstream of the signal and its travel time are used to establish the probabilistic relationship. On the other hand, they are also the input parameters of the model for the estimation. Then, by combining a dynamic traffic flow model with Bayesian inference, we develop a framework to establish the learning process for traffic parameters estimation, such as traffic volume and traffic flow model parameters. The proposed framework is evaluated with different traffic flow models using the NGSIM dataset of an arterial corridor with three signalized intersections. For the CTM-BN model, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the estimation is generally below 5\% when the penetration rate is above 12\%. Regarding the VISSIM-BN model, the MAPE of the estimation is generally below 5\% when the penetration rate is above 6\%. These results demonstrate the applicability of the framework even under a relatively low penetration rate, and that the fidelity of the dynamic traffic model used does influence the estimation performance.}

Most of the existing studies on the max pressure control do not consider the loss of capacity associated with phase switching, which will undermine the stability of the network. This work proposes a novel framework that utilizes reinforcement learning algorithms to optimize a max pressure controller considering the phase switching loss. We extend the max pressure control by introducing a switching curve and prove that the proposed control method is throughput-optimal in a store-and-forward network. Then the theoretical control policy is extended by using a distributed approximation and position-weighted pressure so that the policy-gradient reinforcement learning algorithms can be utilized to optimize the parameters in the policy network including the switching curve and the weight curve. Simulation results show that the proposed control method greatly outperforms the conventional max pressure control. The proposed framework combines the strengths of the data-driven method and the theoretical control model by utilizing reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize the max pressure controller, which is also of great significance for real-world implementations because the proposed control policy can be generated in a distributed fashion based on local observations.}

Firstly, we conduct an empirical study on the growth pattern of traffic oscillations on US-101 Freeway and German-A5 Freeway. Then we perform an experiment to study the growth pattern of traffic oscillations on a single lane with a fixed bottleneck of speed limit. Both empirical and experimental results show that traffic oscillations grow in a concave way along the road. This finding is consistent with the previous one that traffic oscillations grow concavely along the platoon following a slower leader taking on the role of a moving bottleneck, which is not to be expected a priori for a fixed bottleneck. Finally, we use the finding to test three typical car-following models. The test indicates that whereas the intelligent driver model (IDM) fails to reproduce the observed growth pattern, the 2D-IDM and the stochastic speed adaptation model could. These findings are expected to improve our understanding of the role of stochasticity in car following, and the high-quality data in itself can be used to test traffic flow models and theories.}

Their operations are still plagued by response delays that can often be life-threatening. Dispatching and redeployment systems identify the best practices regarding the allocation of the resources to emergencies and stations. Yet, the existing systems are unfortunately insufficient, and there is a growing need to embrace new technological solutions. This research introduces a smart system for EMS by leveraging the modular vehicle technology initially developed for transit systems. The proposed system relies on the design of vehicular modules that can couple and decouple to transfer patients from one module to another during transport. A fleet of medical transport vehicles is deployed to cooperate with the life support vehicles by providing, for example, transport and hospital admission tasks, thus allowing life support vehicles to answer pending emergency calls earlier. This is especially useful when there is a large demand for EMS (e.g. under the COVID-19 pandemic or other disasters such as the recent explosion in Beirut). This paper introduces a mathematical programming model to determine the optimal assignment decisions in a deterministic setting. This work is a proof of concept that demonstrates the applicability of the modular vehicle technology to EMS, evaluating the upper bound EMS performance that can be ultimately reached. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to provide insights and recommendations that are useful when selecting the weighting coefficients for the optimization function, to ensure a more efficient implementation of the modular vehicle technology for EMS. Also, the results of a comparative analysis show that the proposed system can adapt and offer larger benefits, in terms of response times and times to hospital, as demand increases and/or resources become more limited.}

abstract = {Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can form platoons to reduce the time headway and improve the link capacity. However, in a mixed traffic flow environment where both human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs exist, the platoon intensity is significantly impacted by the stochastic order of the HDVs and CAVs (i.e., the fleet sequence). Therefore, the link capacity involves a large uncertainty even under the same HDV and CAV flow. This uncertain link capacity can cause a large variation in network flow. In the literature, traffic assignment models for mixed traffic flows of HDVs and CAVs are developed based on expected link capacity models, in which the computed link capacity is deterministic for given HDV and CAV flows. These models ignore the impacts of uncertain link capacity on the network performance and network flow distribution, which can dramatically reduce the effectiveness of the corresponding planning strategies. To address this problem, this study proposes a worst-case mixed traffic assignment model. It aims to compute the worst network performance and corresponding equilibrium flow that may occur due to uncertain link capacity. The worst-case mixed traffic assignment is formulated as a bilevel programming problem, where the low-level problem is a variational inequality problem presented to compute the equilibrium results based on a fixed link capacity while the upper-level problem is to find the optimal input for all link capacities within their ranges to minimize the network performance. The partition-based norm relaxed method of the feasible direction solution algorithm is proposed to solve the bilevel worst-case mixed traffic assignment problem. A numerical application shows that the uncertain link capacity has drastic effects on the network flows and network performance, and the proposed algorithm can effectively and efficiently solve the bilevel worst-case mixed traffic assignment problem to compute the worst-case network equilibrium flows and network performance. These results can help traffic managers design robust planning strategies to ensure a minimum level of network performance under the impacts of uncertain link capacity.}

While most previous map-matching methods have focused on using rule-based algorithms to deal with the map-matching problems, in this paper, we consider the map-matching task from the data-driven perspective, proposing a deep learning-based map-matching model. We build a Transformer-based map-matching model with a transfer learning approach. We generate trajectory data to pre-train the Transformer model and then fine-tune the model with a limited number of labeled data to minimize the model development cost and reduce the real-to-virtual gaps. Three metrics (Average Hamming Distance, F-score, and BLEU) at two levels (point and segment level) are used to evaluate the model performance. The model is tested with real-world datasets, and the results show that the proposed map-matching model outperforms other existing map-matching models. We also analyze the matching mechanisms of the Transformer in the map-matching process, which helps to interpret the input data’s internal correlation and the external relation between input data and matching results. In addition, the proposed model shows the possibility of using generated trajectories to solve the map-matching problems in the limited labeled data environment.}

The recharging facility location is critical for electric logistics network planning, because it significantly affects future operation costs and efficiency. This study proposes an integrated electric logistics vehicle recharging station location–routing problem with mixed backhauls and recharging strategies, which is formulated as a time-discretized multicommodity network flow optimization model based on a space–time–state–energy representation network. This study aims to optimize the selection of the recharging station location considering route planning with complicated constraints of recharging capacity, facility construction budget, vehicle loading capacity, battery remaining capacity, spatial structure of real road networks, mixed pickup and delivery requests, and service time windows. A hybrid Lagrangian relaxation and alternating direction method of multipliers (LR-ADMM) decomposition solution framework is constructed to decouple the proposed integrated problem into a recharging station location problem for strategic planning and an electric vehicle routing problem with mixed backhauls, time windows, and recharging strategies for operational decisions. These two subproblems are solved alternately by time-dependent forward dynamic programming algorithms embedded into the LR-ADMM framework. The solution quality is guaranteed by calculating the optimality gap between the best lower and upper bounds for each iteration. The experimental results based on the Sioux-Falls network and real-world West Jordan network prove the computational effectiveness and optimization quality of the proposed solution approach.}

Such trips are suitable for reservation-based services, wherein the customer needs to book for a trip in advance. Systems enabling reservation of trips can allow for better planning of routes and schedules, and if optimally designed, enable higher efficiency. The primary objective of this research is to model the effects of such a system, by formulating and solving the combined Dynamic User Equilibrium and Shared autonomous vehicle Chain Formation (DUESCF) problem. The problem is formulated as a bilevel model based on game theory, involving road users and SAV service operator. Given a situation where conventional private and shared autonomous vehicles co-exist, road users select paths and departure times to maximize a perceived utility (commonly treated as minimizing a disutility) by forming a DUE (fixed point problem), and the SAV service operator tries to maximize the performance by forming appropriate SAV chains (combinatorial problem). The final objective of this bilevel model is a traffic assignment that includes SAV chain formation, such that both road users and SAV service operator obtain optimal solutions by reaching a Nash equilibrium, where no player is better off by unilaterally changing their decisions. A solution approach, based on Iterative Optimization and Assignment (IOA) method, is proposed with path flow and SAV performance changes as convergence criteria. Furthermore, the solution approach is tested for its robustness, and a scenario analysis is carried out to evaluate the impacts of reservation-based SAV services. The results show that a ridesharing SAV system is better compared to a carsharing and a mixed system consisting of both, in terms of total system travel time, congestion levels, total vehicle kilometres travelled and vehicle requirements.}

Besides, the effective interaction between controllers, pilots and autonomous operating system can better support the CD&R to work in practice, where humans are able to intuitively understand the rationale for solutions given by automatic decision-making tools. To bridge the gap, a novel operational framework for four-dimensional (4D) trajectory conflict management in the context of free route airspace is proposed. Airspace discretisation based on a 3D grid is used to facilitate the consideration of restricted areas and to balance calculation speed and optimal effect. The core of this framework is a two-stage real-time autonomous 4D trajectory planning method in a restricted en-route sector with multiple flight levels enhanced by solution space visualisation. Stage one is a trajectory pre-planning model based on a visibility graph and the Dijkstra algorithm considering the conflict between aircraft and emerging restricted areas. Stage two is a real-time conflict-free and fuel-optimal 4D trajectory re-planning model. The space–time prism is employed to enable the planned trajectory to meet the controlled time of arrival and trajectory recovery requirements, where the performance preferences of both the air traffic management and airspace users are taken into account. The reachable solution space representation is applied to realise the solution space visualisation that has the potential to support the human–machine interaction and air–ground coordination. A simulation scenario is established to validate the effectiveness, efficiency, stability, and timeliness of the proposed method. Results show that in an artificial en-route sector, the average extra flight distance, average flight delay, average extra fuel consumption, and average computing time for conflict resolution were less than 0.41 km, 2.1 s, 1.5 kg, and 0.08 s in the saturated scenario, respectively, and the domino effect of the flight conflict did not show a significant rise with the increase of traffic density, which verified that the proposed autonomous trajectory operation methodology is a promising approach to facilitate autonomous air traffic management in the future.}

Current prediction methods usually filter out some spatiotemporal partitions with sparse demands by setting a minimum ride-hailing demand threshold, where the dataset is always assumed to be well balanced in terms of its spatiotemporal partitions, with equal misprediction costs. However, this widely used assumption results in large prediction biases. To achieve better prediction performance, we propose a bagging learning approach based on hexagonal convolutional long short-term memory (H-ConvLSTM), which combines three components. 1) By setting multiple minimum ride-hailing demand thresholds, several subdatasets with different majority ride-hailing demand prediction ranges are obtained. The H-ConvLSTM regression model is applied to each undersampled dataset to train multiple submodels with their respective biased ride-hailing demand prediction ranges. 2) The H-ConvLSTM classification model is trained on the total ride-hailing demand dataset to predict the potential demand range for a certain partition at a future time. 3) The submodel with the best performance with respect to the potential demand range is selected to predict the future demand for this partition. Experiments conducted on order data obtained from Didi Chuxing in Chengdu, China, are conducted. The results show that the proposed approach achieves significantly improved prediction performance relative to that of other models.}

To relieve the extreme saturation for overcrowded metro lines, this study explores a novel train operation strategy, i.e., flexibly allocating the capacities through reserving carriages at different stations according to the time-variant passenger demand. With this strategy, the train capacities are reasonably distributed to each station, especially for stations with large passenger flows, so as to balance the passenger accumulation over the whole line. A nonlinear integer programming model is developed by considering the passenger dynamics, and an efficient variable neighborhood search (VNS) algorithm is developed to solve the problem of interest. Finally, a set of numerical experiments with real-world data from Beijing metro Batong line are conducted to verify the performance and effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm. The experimental results show that our proposed approach can effectively obtain high-quality carriage reservation plans in a short computing time, and the generated plans can well balance the passenger accumulation at all involved stations.}

Existing literature on ACCs mostly focus on the planner algorithms or the actuator delay, while the transition process between them, e.g. the low-level control design and its impact are often ignored. This paper tries to fill this gap by digging into the codebase of a recent open-source self-driving system, Openpilot (OP), Comma.ai, from which we extract and formulate the algorithms at both the upper and lower levels. For linear ACCs, the paper extends the transfer function analysis from planners only to full control loops and investigates the impact of slow/fast low-level control on the overall string stability (SS). For MPC ACCs, it studies their planning characteristics based its optimization objectives and approximates the low-level impact using an ODE approach. We find that low-level control has a significant impact on the overall SS of ACCs: (i) slow low-level control undermines SS under small frequencies and improves SS given large frequencies for linear systems, (ii) MPC features a varying gain throughout an oscillation, where the fast low-level control typically results in a ‘fast-slow’ changing process of the MPC gain, which benefits the SS, whereas the slow low-level control leads to a ‘slow-fast’ varying gain which undermines the SS, (iii) slow low-level control are common as they arise from comfort-oriented control gains, from a ”weak” actuator performance or both, and (iv) the SS is very sensitive to the integral gain under slow low-level control for both PI and PIF controllers. Overall, the study recommends fast low-level control for ensuring vehicular SS to reduce traffic congestion, considering that large congestion waves usually feature both small frequencies and large amplitudes, although slow controllers could perform even better provided a short and small leader perturbation. The findings of this paper are verified both numerically and experimentally. For the first time in the literature we implement custom ACC algorithms on market cars, and achieve SS on open roads with a random leader by only tuning the low-level controllers. The source code is shared at https://github.com/HaoZhouGT/openpilot to support on-road experiments of arbitrary car-following models, which may be of interest to other studies.}

abstract = {Go-around manoeuvers are challenging for the management of arriving air traffic due to their complexity and unpredictability. In the present work, we propose to augment the air traffic control (ATC) environment with a predictive tool that assists Air traffic controllers (ATCOs) in the detection and prediction of the likelihood of go-around events. First, a safe and cost-effective flight approach data collection mechanism is introduced via a pilot-operated flight simulator under varying visibility conditions. Then, data are processed and a go-around probability assignment mechanism is introduced. Finally, a go-around probability prediction model is proposed. The proposed model updates the go-around probability for each new flight record, namely every second, and converges by detecting either a go-around or a successful landing. Experiments are conducted for two airports, namely Philadelphia International Airport (PHL) and Van Nuys Airport (KVNY), which feature different go-around procedures and are operated by different types of aircraft. Findings demonstrate that the trajectories of predicted go-around probabilities follow closely the computed probabilities regardless of the dissimilarities in the trajectory patterns. Furthermore, results suggest that the likelihood of go-around exceeds 93\% when the go-around is initiated, for almost 50\% of the flights in the test set. Moreover, the proposed model is able to detect the successful landing of aircraft. In fact, the system indicates low chances of go-around when the aircraft landed. For instance, the likelihood of a go-around at the touchdown is below 35\% and 10\% for KPHL and KVNY, respectively. The findings underscore the ability of the proposed model in providing accurate and timely go-around probabilities. This will help the ATCO to be prepared for re-sequencing arrival flights and clearing the go-around path, prior to the actual initiation of a go-around.}

abstract = {Many city residents cannot install their private electric vehicle (EV) chargers due to the lack of dedicated parking spaces or insufficient grid capacity. This presents a significant barrier towards large-scale EV adoption. To address this concern, this paper considers a novel business model, on-demand valet charging, that unlocks the potential of under-utilized public charging infrastructure to promise higher EV penetration. In the proposed model, a platform recruits a fleet of couriers that shuttle between customers and public charging stations to provide on-demand valet charging services to EV owners at an affordable price. Couriers are dispatched to pick up low-battery EVs from customers, deliver the EVs to charging stations, plug them in, and then return the fully-charged EVs to customers. To depict the proposed business model, we develop a queuing network to represent the stochastic matching dynamics, and further formulate an economic equilibrium model to capture the incentives of couriers, customers as well as the platform. These models are used to examine how charging infrastructure planning and regulatory intervention will affect the market outcome. First, we find that the optimal charging station densities for distinct stakeholders are different: couriers prefer a lower density; the platform prefers a higher density; while the density in-between leads to the highest EV penetration as it balances the time traveling to and queuing at charging stations. Second, we evaluate a regulatory policy that imposes a tax on the platform and invests the tax revenue in public charging infrastructure. Numerical results suggest that this regulation can suppress the platform’s market power associated with monopoly pricing, increase social welfare, and facilitate the market expansion.}

Aiming at solving the problems of low prediction accuracy, difficulty in long-term prediction, and an inability of a fine-grained level description of conventional models, a prediction model based on an attention-aided encoder-decoder structure and deep neural network (DNN) is proposed. This study analyzes the LC process and proposes an LC segmentation and sampling method for dividing LC into four stages. The optimal attention-aided encoder-decoder model is tested by trajectory data in the four LC stages and then a heuristic network model is designed. In addition, the proposed heuristic network is connected with the DNN for predicting vehicle kinematics data while predicting the vehicle trajectory. Finally, the heuristic network and DNN are tested in cascade to form a joint cascade prediction model that can perform a fine-grained LC description based on the prediction results. The experimental results show that the proposed cascade prediction model has high accuracy and long-term prediction capability of a vehicle’s trajectory, velocity, acceleration, and steering angle and is also capable of fine-grained LC description. The proposed prediction model can provide a useful theoretical basis for further research on ICVs and CAVs.}

This review makes an initial step towards shaping the role of AI in future railways and provides a summary of the current focuses of AI research connected to rail transport. We reviewed about 139 scientific papers covering the period from 2010 to December 2020. We found that the major research efforts have been put in AI for rail maintenance and inspection, while very limited or no research has been found on AI for rail transport policy and revenue management. The remaining sub-domains received mild to moderate attention. AI applications are promising and tend to act as a game-changer in tackling multiple railway challenges. However, at the moment, AI research in railways is still mostly at its early stages. Future research can be expected towards developing advanced combined AI applications (e.g. with optimization), using AI in decision making, dealing with uncertainty and tackling newly rising cybersecurity challenges.}

Extensive research has been conducted on single-mode demand prediction, ignoring the fact that the demands for different transportation modes can be correlated with each other. Despite some recent efforts, existing approaches to multimodal demand prediction are generally not flexible enough to account for spatiotemporal correlations across different modes with heterogeneous spatial units. To tackle these issues, this study proposes a multi-relational spatiotemporal graph neural network (ST-MRGNN) for multimodal demand prediction. Specifically, the spatial dependencies across modes are encoded with multiple intra- and inter-modal relation graphs. A multi-relational graph neural network (MRGNN) is introduced to capture cross-mode heterogeneous spatial dependencies, consisting of generalized graph convolution networks to learn the message passing mechanisms within relation graphs and an attention-based aggregation module to summarize different relations. We further integrate MRGNNs with temporal gated convolution layers to jointly model spatiotemporal correlations. Extensive experiments are conducted using real-world subway and ride-hailing datasets from New York City, and the results verify the improved performance of our proposed approach over existing methods across modes. The improvement is particularly large for demand-sparse locations. Further analysis of the attention mechanisms of ST-MRGNN also demonstrates its good interpretability for understanding cross-mode interactions.}

The constraints that are typically imposed for school buses are bus capacity, a maximum student walking distance to a pickup point, and a maximum commute time for each student. This is a special case of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with a common destination. We propose a decomposition approach for solving this problem based on the existing notion of a shareability network, which has been used recently in the context of dynamic ridepooling problems. Moreover, we come up with a simplified formulation for solving the SSRP by introducing the connection between the SSRP and the weighted set covering problem (WSCP). To scale this method to large-scale problem instances, we propose (i) a node compression method for the shareability network based decomposition approach, and (ii) heuristic-based edge pruning techniques that perform well in practice. We show that the compressed problem leads to an Integer Linear Program (ILP) of reduced dimensionality that can be solved efficiently using off-the-shelf ILP solvers. Numerical experiments on the synthetic Boston Public School (BPS) instances are conducted to evaluate the performance of our approach. Meanwhile, our proposed SSRP formulation allows a natural extension for introducing alternate transportation modes to students, which effectively reduces the number of buses needed for each school and leads to a 15\% cost reduction on average. Moreover, two state-of-art large-scale SSRP solving techniques are compared with our proposed approaches on benchmark networks and our methods outperform both techniques under a single school setting.}

However, none of the existing studies considered flexible services under the framework of synchromodality. This paper develops a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to formulate service flexibility in ST planning. In the MILP model, vehicles with flexible services as well as fixed services are both considered, and vehicle routes and request routes are planned simultaneously. Due to the computational complexity, an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search heuristic is designed to solve the problem. Several customized operators are designed based on the characteristics of the studied problem. The proposed model is compared with the models developed in a highly-cited paper and a newly published paper that do not consider service flexibility. Case studies on small instances verified that the proposed model with flexibility performs better on all scenarios, including scenarios with different weights for the individual objectives, scenarios under congestion,and dynamic optimization scenarios. On large instances (up to 1600 shipment requests), the proposed model with flexibility reduces the cost by 14\% on average compared with the existing models in the literature.}

According to the research themes, first, we describe the literature on the supply side of EV-carsharing systems as strategic planning (charging station location, number, capacity and fleet size), daily operations (vehicle relocation and vehicle charging) and integrated modelling for strategic planning and daily operations. Optimization models and algorithms are surveyed in each theme. Then, we describe the literature on the demand side of EV-carsharing systems according to the factors affecting EV-carsharing demand and demand forecasting methods.

abstract = {Recent development on autonomous and connected trucks (ACT) has provided the freight industry with the new option of using truck platooning to improve their fuel efficiency, traffic throughput, and safety. However, closely spaced and longitudinally aligned trucks impose frequent and concentrated loading on pavements, which often accelerates pavement deterioration and increase the life-cycle costs for the highway agency. Also, effectiveness of truck platooning can only be maximized in dedicated lanes, and its benefits and costs need to be properly balanced between stakeholders. This paper proposes a network design model to optimize (i) placement of dedicated truck platoon lanes and toll price in a highway network, (ii) pooling and routing of ACT traffic from multiple origins and destinations to utilize these lanes, and (iii) configuration of truck platoons within these lanes (e.g., lateral displacements and vehicle separations). The problem is formulated as an integrated bi-level optimization model. The upper level makes decisions on converting existing highway lanes into dedicated platoon lanes, as well as setting user fees. The lower level decisions are made by independent shippers regarding the choice of routes, use of platoon lanes vs. regular lanes, and they collectively determine truck traffic in all lanes. Link cost functions for platoon lanes are obtained by simultaneously optimizing, through dynamic programming, pavement rehabilitation activities and platoon configuration in the pavement’s life cycle. A numerical case study is used to demonstrate the applicability and performance of the proposed model framework over the Illinois freeway system. It is shown that the freight traffic is effectively channelized on a few corridors of platoon lanes and, by setting proper user fees to cover pavement rehabilitation costs, system-wide improvements for both freight shippers and highway agencies can be achieved.}

abstract = {In presence of the emerging technology of automated vehicles, it is anticipated that the future traffic system would be comprised of mixed traffic with both self-driving autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human-driven conventional vehicles. It is imperative to propose new traffic management measures to manage the future traffic system, as complement of the existing ones such as road pricing schemes. This study seeks to take advantage of the controllable property of AVs’ routing choices to develop a day-to-day routing allocation scheme for a certain number of autonomous vehicles so as to drive the mixed traffic system into a desired traffic state. Specifically, we assume that all travelers are bounded rational and AV users are willing to accept route allocation with route travel cost not exceeding HV users’ indifference band. Therefore, the best-case bounded rationality user equilibrium (BRUE) flow pattern is in principle the most desirable traffic state out of all the BRUE solutions. This study proposes a day-to-day AVs’ routing allocation scheme by which the traffic system would be directed to evolve towards the desired best-case BRUE. The day-to-day traffic dynamics of HVs are proposed to follow a general framework, which can be further proved to be the BRUE rational behavior adjustment process (BRUE-RBAP). The condition for convergence is investigated under general assumptions. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of this traffic management scheme.}

In both cases, it becomes necessary to develop adaptive crowd motion control systems. In particular, adaptive cell-based crowd evacuation systems dynamically generate exit-choice recommendations favoring a coordinated group dynamic that improves safety and evacuation time. We investigate the viability of using this mechanism to develop a “leader-follower” evacuation system in which a trained evacuation staff guides evacuees safely to the exit gates. To validate the proposal, we use a simulation–optimization framework integrating microscopic simulation. Evacuees’ behavior has been modeled using a three-layered architecture that includes eligibility, exit-choice changing, and exit-choice models, calibrated with hypothetical-choice experiments. As a significant contribution of this work, the proposed behavior models capture the influence of leaders on evacuees, which is translated into exit-choice decisions and the adaptation of speed. This influence can be easily modulated to evaluate the evacuation efficiency under different evacuation scenarios and evacuees’ behavior profiles. When measuring the efficiency of the evacuation processes, particular attention has been paid to safety by using pedestrian Macroscopic Fundamental Diagrams (p-MFD), which model the crowd movement dynamics from a macroscopic perspective. The spatiotemporal view of the evacuation performance in the form of crowd-pressure vs. density values allowed us to evaluate and compare safety in different evacuation scenarios reasonably and consistently. Experimental results confirm the viability of using adaptive cell-based crowd evacuation systems as a guidance tool to be used by evacuation staff to guide evacuees. Interestingly, we found that evacuation staff motion speed plays a crucial role in balancing egress time and safety. Thus, it is expected that by instructing evacuation staff to move at a predefined speed, we can reach the desired balance between evacuation time, accident probability, and comfort.}

Concurrently, crowd-shipping has been gaining in popularity due to both the increase in e-commerce and the current pressures due to COVID-19. We consider a setting where a crowd-shipping platform can fulfill heterogeneous delivery requests from a central depot with a fleet of professionally driven vehicles and a pool of capacitated occasional drivers. We divide delivery requests into sectors to represent different neighborhoods in a city. Occasional drivers have unknown destinations that can be anywhere inside the sectors. Route duration constraints are modeled to motivate participation and increase the probability of route-acceptance by keeping routes short. We assume that occasional drivers will choose routes that are better compensated and that the probability of route-acceptance is dependent on other routes being offered. We propose a two-stage stochastic model to formulate the problem. We use a branch-and-price algorithm capable of solving 50-customer instances, and develop a heuristic that can solve larger 100-customer instances quickly. An upper bound for the total number of occasional drivers is used to reduce the number of constraints in the master problem and reduce the complexity of the pricing problems. We show that occasional drivers with destinations far from the depot reduce the cost by over 30\%, while occasional drivers with destinations that are near the depot reduce the cost by 20\%. We show that route duration constraints and capacity constraints can restrict the occasional driver routes and both need to simultaneously increase in order to have cost reductions. This setting of crowd-shipping is a viable option for last-mile deliveries.}

For the network datasets, the results indicate that the method yields satisfactory parameter estimates and graphical fits for roughly 50\% of the studied networks, where estimations fall within the expected range of the parameter values. The satisfactory estimates are mostly for the datasets which (i) cover a relatively wider range of densities and (ii) the average flow values at different densities are approximately normally distributed similar to the probability density function of the SMoC. The estimated parameter values are compared to the real or expected values and any discrepancies and their potential causes are discussed in depth to identify the challenges in the MFD estimation both analytically and empirically. In particular, we find that the most important issues needing further investigation are: (i) the distribution of loop detectors within the links, (ii) the distribution of loop detectors across the network, and (iii) the treatment of unsignalized intersections and their impact on the block length.}

To characterize the problem mathematically, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model is formulated to minimize the passenger waiting time and operating costs of the metro system simultaneously. This model is further reformulated equivalently into a mixed-integer linear programming model via the linearization method. An effective heuristic algorithm based on the tabu search and CPLEX solver is designed to find high-quality solutions for the proposed problem. Finally, two sets of numerical examples, including a small-scale example and a large-scale example based on the Beijing metro Batong line, are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed methods.

Now that they are widespread, it is observed that the majority of existing systems are string unstable. Therefore, small perturbations in the speed profile of a vehicle are amplified for the vehicles following upstream, with negative impacts on traffic flow, fuel consumption, and safety. Increased headway settings provide more stable flow but at the same time it deteriorates the capacity. Substantial research has been carried out in the past decade on utilizing connectivity to overcome this trade-off. However, such connectivity solutions have to overcome several obstacles before deployment and there is the concrete risk that motorway traffic flow will considerably deteriorate in the meanwhile. As an alternative solution, the paper explores multianticipation without inter-vehicle communication, taking advantage of the recent advancements in the field of RADAR sensing. An analytical study is carried out, based on the most widely used model and parameter settings used to simulate currently available commercial ACC systems, comparing the transfer functions and step responses for the nominal and the multianticipative formulations. Then, a microsimulation framework is employed to validate our claim on different speed profiles. Analytical results demonstrate that multianticipation enhances stability without impacting traffic flow. On the contrary, the simulation study indicates that the multianticipative-ACC can produce higher road capacity even in the presence of external disturbances and for a wide range of calibrated parameters. Finally, optimality conditions for the tuning of the headway policy are derived from a Pareto optimization.}

abstract = {Guaranteeing the quality of transit service is of great importance to promote the attractiveness of buses and alleviate urban traffic issues such as congestion and pollution. Emerging technologies of automated driving and V2X communication have the potential to enable the accurate control of vehicles and the efficient organization of traffic to enhance both the schedule adherence of buses and the overall network mobility. This study proposes a novel network-level control scheme for heterogeneous automated traffic composed of buses and private cars under a full connected and automated environment. Inheriting the idea of network-level rhythmic control proposed by Lin et al. (2021b), an innovative rhythmic control scheme for heterogeneous traffic, i.e., RC-H, is established to organize the mixed traffic in a rhythmic manner. Realized virtual platoons are designed for accommodating vehicles to pass through the network, including dedicated virtual platoons for buses to provide exclusive right-of-ways (ROWs) on their trips and regular virtual platoons for private cars along with an optimal assignment plan to minimize the total travel cost. A mixed-integer linear program (MILP) is formulated to optimize the RC-H scheme with the objective of minimizing the weighted travel costs of both buses and private cars. A bilevel heuristic solution method is designed to relieve the computational burden of MILP. Numerical examples and simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the RC-H scheme under different scenarios. The results show that the bus punctuality can be guaranteed and the traveler delay can be minimized under various demand levels with transit priority. Moreover, compared with traffic signal control (TSC) strategies, including those with fixed timing and those with bus priority, the RC-H scheme shows significant advantages in handling heavy traffic demand, in terms of both reducing vehicle delay and enhancing network throughput.}
