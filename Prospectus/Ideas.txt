Have a slide on how I chose the papers to cite:  Original paper for techniques, then recent papers in crash analysis lit that used the techniques.  

Paper:  Have list of acronyms.  Even if we don't put in a list of algorithms, make sure the paper tells, in each section, what they mean before using them.
