\index{To Do!Revise CRSS Feature Engineering}

Binning a feature is a form of feature engineering, but here I mean merging elements from two or more features into a new feature.  

One new feature we have created is a binary feature Rush Hour, combining Day of Week (WKDY\_IM) and Hour (HOUR\_IM), using the percent of people hospitalized in crashes at a particular hour on a weekday to draw the lines.  

We also looked at crossing AGE\_IM with SEX\_IM to bin ages separately by gender, because the correlation to hospitalization is more complicated than either feature separately.
