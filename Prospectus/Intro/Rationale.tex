Novel Aspects of this Work

\begin{itemize}
	\item New Real-World Problem:  Newly emerging problem of how to use the greatly increasing volume of automated crash notification data.
	\item New Dataset:  The Louisiana dataset has not appeared significantly in the literature.
	\item New Imputation of Unknown Values in Well Known Dataset (\acrshort{crss})
	\item New Metrics:  Balanced Precision and Balanced F1
	\item Interpretation of Class Weights as a Political/Ethical Cost-Benefit Tradeoff
	\item New Combinations of Methods:  The Louisiana data is very incomplete, dirty, and imbalanced, and the CRSS data is imbalanced.  Off-the-shelf methods will not give the level of confidence needed for life-and-death decisions.  
\end{itemize}
