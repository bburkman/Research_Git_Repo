\section{Previous Work}

Two documents accompany this prospectus report to show the variety of work I have done.  

\begin{enumerate}
	\item A partial draft of the paper I plan to submit to {\it Transportation Research Part C:  Emerging Technologies} in January 2023, using the journal's \LaTeX template.  
	\item My study guide for the 2019 Algorithms qualifying exam.
