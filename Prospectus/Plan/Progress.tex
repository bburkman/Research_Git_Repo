\section{Progress To Date}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Reviewed literature (ongoing process)
	\item Developed problem
	\item Chose datasets (\acrfull{crss} \cite{CRSS} and Louisiana)
	\item Learned how to build custom loss functions in Keras.  (It's not really an option in scikit-learn.)
	\item Understood a wide variety of methods for handling imbalanced data.  Many of them are available in Keras, and some I had to implement myself.  
	\item Learned to use \acrfull{iveware} \cite{IVEware} and used it to impute unknown values in CRSS
\end{itemize}
