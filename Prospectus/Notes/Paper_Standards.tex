\section{Paper Standards}

When I took a 619 with Dr. Raghavan, he rejected my first draft of my paper because it could be summarized as, ``I used existing methods to do the same thing other people have done, but on my own data.''  He expected me to have done more thinking and synthesis.  

I had written the paper that way because that's what most of the papers I'd read did.  I learned later that I had been reading in a low-ranked journal.  

I feel like most of the {\it Accident Analysis and Prevention} papers are like that, ``I did a thing!''  If this field had benchmark datasets, it would be easier to see what is actually new in each article.  The {\it AAP} journal is not well ranked.  The {\it Transportation Research: Part C, Emerging Technologies} is better in both content and rankings.  I'll use the {\it TRC} articles as models.
