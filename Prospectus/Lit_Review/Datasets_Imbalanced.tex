Zheng 2021 \cite{ZHENG_2021}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Oversampling, undersampling, and hybrid methods use random sampling ratios.  [What?  How?  I thought the user set the sampling ratios.]
	\item This paper proposes three algorithms to automatically set the sampling ratios using genetic algorithms.  	
	\item Used fourteen datasets, some of which may be useful benchmark datasets.
\end{itemize}

Wang 2021 \cite{WANG_2021}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Uses seven benchmark imbalanced datasets from the UCI machine learning repository
	\item Implicit regularization for dynamic ensemble selection of classifiers.
\end{itemize}
