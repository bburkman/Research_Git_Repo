\subsection{Jargon to Understand}

From \verb|24_May_2021_Report|:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Naturalistic Driving Data - Data collected from sensors installed in the driver's own car, trying to get as close as possible to the driver's ``natural'' behavior. \index{Naturalistic Driving Data}
	\item Heterogeneity.  I understand vaguely what ``data heterogeneity'' means, but I'm going to watch for the term to see how it's used in the context of these papers.  \index{Heterogeneity}

\subsection{IRB, SHRP Database}

Eleven of the papers in {\it Accident Analysis and Prevention} used the Strategic Highway Research Program 2 (SHRP2) Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS), which put sensors in 3400 cars and recorded five million trips, including crashes.  To get ``Qualified Researcher Status'' with ``full access to data that has been made available through the SHRP 2 NDS Data Access Website,'' I had to submit a certificate of training on research with human subjects.  I did the training through the UL Institutional Review Board (IRB). I now have access.

\subsection{NGSIM Database}

Three papers use the Next Generation Simulation dataset from the US Dept of Transportation, and it's available for download with no restrictions.
