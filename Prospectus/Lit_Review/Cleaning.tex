In ``A deep learning based traffic crash severity prediction framework'' by Rahim (LSU) \cite{RAHIM2021106090}, they just deleted any records with missing or inconsistent data.  The {\it Titanic} Kaggle sites Dr. Jin showed me use several other methods for filling in incomplete data.  

Rahim's article took out 37\% of the records for missing or inconsistent data, but only 21\% of the fatal crashes; could that imbalance in the data cleaning skew the model prediction?  It makes sense that police would be more meticulous in their record keeping for fatal crashes, but 21\% and 37\% are huge.
