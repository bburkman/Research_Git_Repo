\section{Overview}


The Louisiana dataset, a census of crash reports, has restricted access, and I only have a portion of it.  I cannot give readers access to the data to check or build on my work; thus, I am focusing on the CRSS data but using the Louisiana data for another viewpoint and to get experience with a different kind of data.  

I have the data 2014-2018.  Its organization is similar to that of CRSS, with Crash, Vehicle, and Occupant datasets to be merged.  The Crash data set for those five years has 828,248 samples.  

I have not worked with the Louisiana database since March, when I changed my focus to the CRSS database.  When I go back to the Louisiana database, my approach will be different.  Before, I had only used the Crash data set, not the Vehicle and Person data sets; I will use all three, as I did with the CRSS.   When I started with the Louisiana, I just looked at fatalities, but now I will look at hospitalization.
