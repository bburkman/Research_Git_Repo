\subsection{Research Plan}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item On both raw data sets, do cleanup, feature selection, and feature engineering.  To the extent possible, make the two engineered data sets the same.
	\item Starting with the easiest-to-obtain data (general location, time/day, weather), and interatively adding more data (persons, vehicles, specific location), build and evaluate a model that predicts whether an ambulance is needed.
	\item Combine results from the two datasets.
	\item Interpret and discuss how the model improves as more data becomes available.  
\end{enumerate}
