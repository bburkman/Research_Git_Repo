\subsection{Apps to Detect Crashes}
The idea of using the accelerometer in a cell phone to detect a crash and notify the police goes back to at least 2011 with {\it WreckWatch}, an app prototype by \cite{RN29097389220110101}.  A few years later, \cite{edseee.692210720140801} proposed an app that would detect not only a crash but its severity, and send the phone owner's medical information.  In September 2019, Google hinted that it would have crash detection in its Pixel phones soon \citep{XDA}, and it is now available \citep{GooglePixelCrash}.  In November 2021, the Wall Street Journal announced that Apple was thinking of introducing such an app in its iPhones and Apple watches in 2022 \cite{edsgcl.68102971120211102}, but as of this writing, such an app had not come out yet.  The App Store does have some unverified third-party apps, like those from \cite{SOSmart} and \cite{Blink!}.
