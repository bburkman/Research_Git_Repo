\subsection{Novel Aspects of this Work}

\begin{description}
	\item [Application] We applied existing methods to an emerging application, automated cell phone crash reports.
	\item [Imputing Missing Data]  Other authors have imputed missing values in the CRSS data set, but as far as we know, we are the first to try the method the CRSS authors used (IVEware).
	\item [Cost-Sensitive Analysis] This method has appeared in the crash literature, but we made it central to our analysis.
	\item [Open Science] To promote transferability, we have attached all of the code we used.
