\section{Methods}

We used the Crash Report Sampling System (CRSS) \cite{CRSS} data to train and test our model.  After preparing the data, we built a variety of models with different combinations of techniques for handling imbalanced data, model types, loss functions, and sets of features, with the overall goal of finding an optimal combination of methods to give the most useful model.
