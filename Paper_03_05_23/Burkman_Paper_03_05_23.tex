New Google Pixel phones can automatically notify police if the phone detects the deceleration profile of a crash.  From the data available from such an automatic notification, can we build a machine-learning model that will recommend whether police should immediately, perhaps automatically, dispatch an ambulance?  If the injuries are serious, time to medical care is critical, but few crashes result in serious injuries, and ambulances are in limited supply and expensive.  Such a model will not be perfect, with many false positives (sending an ambulance when one is not needed) and some false negatives (not sending an ambulance when one is needed), but better than random.  How much better depends on several things that we will investigate.

A key idea underlying this analysis is that the costs of the false positives and false negatives are very different.  The cost of sending an ambulance when one is not needed is measured in dollars, but the cost of not sending an ambulance when one is needed is measured in lives.  We propose a way to interpret class weights as the ethical rate of tradeoff.

We will show that the quality of the model depends mostly on what information is available to inform the decision of whether to immediately dispatch an ambulance.  Whether a model is ``good'' is partly a political question, weighing prompt medical care against its high cost, but given a parameter $p$ of how to weigh those costs, we can build that tradeoff into the model.

%We will show that the quality of the model depends mostly on what information is available to inform the decision of whether to immediately dispatch an ambulance.  Some information (location, time of day, day of week, weather) either come with the report or are known beforehand.  Other information (age and sex of phone's primary user, vehicle likely to be driven by that person) may be very helpful in making the decision to send the ambulance, but getting that information would require instantaneous communication between private and public databases.  Being able to interpret the location (is that precise location inside an intersection with high speed limits?) in real time would require planning and preparation.  Implementing such a system would require budgets, cooperation, privacy concerns, and probably legislation, but knowing which data is most useful can help set priorities.  

We used the data of the Crash Report Sampling System (CRSS).% from the US Department of Transportation (DOT)'s National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) \cite{CRSS}.  
This data is freely available online.  We have applied new methods (for this dataset in the literature) to handle missing data, and we have investigated several methods for handling the data imbalance.  To promote discussion and future research, we have included all of the code we used in our analysis.

% Research highlights
\begin{highlights}
	\item  Supports transferability and benchmarking of different approaches on a public large-scale dataset.  We have attached the code we used to perform the analysis on the Crash Report Sampling System.  
	\item Novel Application motivated by Emerging Technology:  Machine Learning Classification Models for Dispatching Ambulances based on Automated Crash Reports
	\item New Use of Dataset:  Used Crash Report Sampling System (CRSS), which has imputed missing values for some features, but not all of the ones we wanted to use.  For the first time we have seen, we used the software the CRSS authors use for multiple imputation (IVEware) to impute missing values in more features.  
	\item Perennial Machine Learning Challenge:  Imbalanced Datasets.
