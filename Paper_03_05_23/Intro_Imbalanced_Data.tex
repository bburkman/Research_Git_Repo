\subsection{Imbalanced Data}

Only a small proportion of crashes require immediate medical attention.  In the CRSS data, about 15\% of persons involved in a crash were transported by ambulance.  If we built a model that classified all crashes as ``Ambulance Not Needed,'' the model would have 85\% accuracy, which would be excellent in some other applications, but not here.  The toolkit for building models on imbalanced data is well established, but many of the tools only work for continuous data (our data is all categorical).
